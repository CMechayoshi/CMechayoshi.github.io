<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Look
what I made. Your favorite, bro!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi slid
a plate full of steaming pancakes covered in maple syrup across the
table to Mario. He&rsquo;d beaten his brother out of bed by twenty
minutes or so for once. The elder plumber rubbed his eyes before
accepting the plate and digging in. While they were eating, the radio
tuned in to WMUSH first detailed some news about &lsquo;gangs in Toad
Town&rsquo;, then in a talk show section asked the question, &lsquo;Is
it better to be relevant or real?&rsquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi slid
his empty plate aside. &ldquo;What were you and the princess talking
about last night?&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
yawned. &ldquo;MK East were ran by hacks who thought they were being
blackmailed by another hospital, but authorities couldn&rsquo;t find
any evidence of that actually going on, and the two ringleaders of it
all were attacked and are in the hospital themselves. Prison
hospital... They have no idea who did the attacking.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
about the sick??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
Case X patients were sent to MK Hospital South, not that that&rsquo;s
doing much. The standard cure for Mushroom Flu doesn&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
thought for a moment. &ldquo;So&hellip; we absolutely need the cure
Bowser is offering then.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario eyes
dart up from the breakfast to him. &ldquo;No&hellip; Never!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Then
how-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
don&rsquo;t know what game Bowser is playing, but he wont&rsquo; get
away with it.&rdquo; Mario got up from the table and went in the
bedroom, closing the door.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi got
up stood outside it, shocked by the outburst. &ldquo;Mario, you don&rsquo;t
really think Bowser was stringing us along all day, do you?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
thought about the clues: Bowser WAS the one to point out the tainted
soda that belong to him, he did do anything entirely antagonistic
while with them when he easily could have done so, and most
importantly he ratted out his &lsquo;own&rsquo; accomplishes. He
wouldn&rsquo;t call Bowser innocent, but there was certainly more to
it all.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Later
Mario came out fully dressed and so without much speaking between
them, they took the Mach bike over to Peach&rsquo;s Castle to deal
with a Bowser complication for the umpteenth time. </font>
</p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After
getting a tip from his police radio, Jelectro Bond arrived at the
train yard at 8 am. The sun was low in the sky and dew drops were in
the grass, though it sparse in the area. Bond&rsquo;s Aston Mushroom
was given a quick look by the local police before they quickly rushed
him.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sir,
this is a crime scene.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond
pretend to seem lost for a moment. &ldquo;Mon ami, but I own stock
here! See that? I just want to check it before it departs.&rdquo;
Bond pointed to a train car on a rail that had, &lsquo;Gold Bars x3&rsquo;
on it, intentionally using his left arm to point, which had his shiny
Rolex Submariner on it. Combined with the fancy car and casual wear
of a green Hawaiian shirt, he had the perfect image of a rich but
clueless guy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The toad
officer flushed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry sir! Umm, just stay away
from the taped area.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond began
to walk towards &lsquo;his&rsquo; expensive shipment cart with his
attention actually directed a few rails to the left. There was a
young koopa officer with a completely white face speaking to a spike
detective with a trench coat and hat.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Go
around that train right there if you want to see. It ain&rsquo;t
pretty,&rdquo; the officer told the spike.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond
crawled under the locomotive to reach where few other officers and
investigators were gathered closely. With his short stature, he had
no trouble seeing pass their legs to the body on the ground. It was a
goomba engineer with powdery brown skin, eyes dead and wide, and his
mouth hung open. Laying only a few inches from his gape was a pink
and red bloated looking organ with a trail of bile colored liquid. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That&rsquo;s
his liver,&rdquo; A raspy sounding crazee dayzee officer told the
detective as he wrote down some notes. &ldquo;It was squeezed out of
him but his body doesn&rsquo;t have a single bruise on it, aside from
maybe when he fell over dead. This will make the tenth homicide just
this morning..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond
rubbed his tired eyes. </font>
</p>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><b>Bowser&rsquo;s
Castle</b> </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy was
walking down the long dark stairway to the lab, listening to the
soundtrack of &lsquo;Koopa Ball Z&rsquo; on his MP3 player. The mad
scientist had gotten the exactly two in a half hours of sleep he
always got and felt great. His agenda for the day involved getting
his &lsquo;womanizing spray&rsquo; formula out of the prototype phase
so that maybe he could finally have a girl to take with him to the
comic con that was coming to Glitzville where he planned to get his
physical copy of &lsquo;Death Streetpass&rsquo; signed. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He paused
the music to wave when he saw his brother down stairs. &ldquo;Hey,
Luddy-sama. What&rsquo;s shaking this morning?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Unfortunate
events,&rdquo; Ludwig groaned as he twisted a crook out of his back.
&ldquo;I spent all night here and I cannot remember a thing!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy met
him at the bottom. &ldquo;What do you mean you can&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Never
mind, you surely have the backup notes that I always give you,
correct? I know you have them. I usually put them under your pillow
whilst you are asleep.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It was no
easy feat, but Iggy was weirded out. &ldquo;Umm&hellip; You only told
me to contact those people King Dad fired, Slam and Sam, who now work
in the video game store &lsquo;Play N Tirade&rsquo; by the way. The
rest you did all on your own. Also I really don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ve
been in my room recently or you would have commented on my giant
Princess Rosalina Queen of Space figurine with removeable-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Shh!&rdquo;
Ludwig&rsquo;s hand covered Iggy&rsquo;s mouth. &ldquo;You have just
said something slightly not stupid! I did do it on my own, did I not?
So independent was I that I failed to mention any of it to Vater.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mm
mm mm!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy,
you scintillate today! Correct, I followed no usual procedure of mine
in anyway, down to the sneaking into your room at night.&rdquo;
Ludwig dug out from his pocket a crumpled yellow note with dozens of
ideas written on it. &ldquo;What is notable here to you?&rdquo; He
removed his hand.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy slid
his glasses close to his face. &ldquo;I see by that faint liquid ring
that you used the yellow memo pad that Kamek uses as a drink coaster
and that you used that same fountain pen that Morton chewed on one
time because it leaks, also you must of been holding the pen too
tightly and your arm got tired, because you switched hands halfway
through?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
ripped the note apart. &ldquo;Actually the point is, I threw it in
the garbage! This Monday, our garbage collector was lingering around
with that note and I hardly remember anything since then. In
eliminating the impossible, it could only be that he did something to
my sense of judgment. Why would I want you to contact former
employees of the castle? Why would I use soda? Why would I get out of
bed this morning without combing my hair? Come here.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
brushed pass Iggy to climb the steps.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">But,
my womanizing spray!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
stopped. &ldquo;Iggy, if you do not direct your attention to greater
matters, like fixing this mess, there may not be any females left to
be... ugh... attracted to you!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy
yanked the earbuds from his ears. &ldquo;Say what?!?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Let
me rephrase. If you do not wish to help, remember that I control the
server with your countless wasted hours of data on it&hellip; And
your live streams!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
sprinted up the steps before Iggy could retaliate.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser was
finally starting to relax in his hot tub when his bathroom door swung
open and all of the steam in the room was sucked out, revealing a
certain little tyke.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey
pops, look what I made!!!&rdquo; Bowser Junior wore and army green
colored Koopa Scouts uniform with dozens of badges pinned on it. His
heavy backpack was still on his shoulders and jutting from it were
flags, posters and other knickknacks. It was a miracle he could tote
it all and still bounce about the bathroom like he&rsquo;d consumed a
spring mushroom. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
sighed under his breath before trying to look cheery. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
back! How was camp, son?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Good
good good! It was so so cool!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Okay,
so why don&rsquo;t you play in your room while I-&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Junior
bum-rushed for the tub holding a glass container. &ldquo;Look at my
ant trooper farm!!! They&rsquo;re all poisonous, isn&rsquo;t that
cool?!&rdquo; Leaning over the edge of the tub, Junior pressed the
ant farm into Bowser&rsquo;s face, who gently pushed it back.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That&rsquo;s
great Junior. Now listen, things went down Friday so we&rsquo;re
going to have to head over to Peach&rsquo;s place in a little while.
Remember her?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She&rsquo;s
that woman you dream about that never dates you!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
slapped Junior, making suds splash everywhere before he remembered
that Junior was supposed to be the &lsquo;favorite&rsquo; of his
kids. &ldquo;Sorry son.&rdquo; Bowser rubbed the red spot on Junior&rsquo;s
cheek, who quickly jerked away and crossed his arms. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
know what that blonde bimbo wants and it ain&rsquo;t you dad! I&rsquo;m
short, not stupid.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
growled, rumbling the room almost.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
agree Vater, that is a sacrilegious venture, besides we all know
Junior is both short and stupid!&rdquo; Ludwig stood in the doorway.
Thin perspiration was visible on his forehead.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Not
you too,&rdquo; Bowser leaned on one of his elbows. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
a koopa have a bath in the morning?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Not
when Luddy-sama knows my VPN passcode!&rdquo; Iggy ran inside and
tackled Ludwig. When he hit the floor a number of objects few out of
his jacket pocket, some makeup, a little glow in the dark stick,
shutter sunglasses, a pocket thesaurus, and some portable DJ
headphones. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig!!!
Give me back my &lsquo;Douchebag and Cabana&rsquo; powder foundation
kit!!&rdquo; a feminine voice screeched from outside the room.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Right
then, the rest of the koopalings barged in.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">If
you do not return my miniaturized thesaurus, I will never find out
what bigger and better words I can use to impress my new pin pals on
Facenote and Instaham! I will be a simpleton, stupid, Leston!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A buffed
out Koopaling crossed their arms. &ldquo;Listen up, nerd. Give me
back my new shades or else. They&rsquo;re gonna get me all the babes
at school!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig,
why did you take my glow stick? Now all of my stuffed animals can&rsquo;t
have their sleep over and they&rsquo;re sad,&rdquo; someone bouncing
on a ball said.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yo,
I hate all of you. I used Wendy&rsquo;s credit card to buy those
audiophile grade &lsquo;BATES&rsquo; by Dr. Greg headphones so they
better not be broken.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wendy got
in Larry&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;It was YOU who put that charge on my
&lsquo;Masterplan&rsquo; card?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
gulped just as the rest of the koopalings started their protests
against Ludwig all over again.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">SHUT
UP EVERYONE SHUT UP!&rdquo; Bowser bellowed. &ldquo;You are making me
VERY ANGRY and now my bath is cold. What&rsquo;s the meaning of this
&lsquo;brat&rsquo; reunion?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
picked himself up from the ground. &ldquo;You may be wondering why I
gathered you all here.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Roy
snorted. &ldquo;So we could beat up a pompous, supercilious, blue
haired freak like you in one convenient location?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Morton
turned to Roy. &ldquo;Did you read my thesaurus?&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Umm,
totally not, punk!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
growled.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig got
himself together quickly. &ldquo;Okay, so I was unsuccessful in
developing a cure last night and my theory is that my mind was
compromised by our renegade garbage collector. By the way, he did not
turn in for his shift this morning might I add. I suggest the most
rational course of action: request the help of some conveniently
hardy mules- I mean, Mario and his associates to help us in the
difficult process of obtaining parts of the cure I&rsquo;ve hidden
around the Mushroom Kingdom.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
stared blankly. &ldquo;But why did you do that?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Please
do not question what my late night sleep deprived self that often
sneaks into Iggy&rsquo;s room is capable of! Besides you cannot hide
anything in Dark Land. The lava melts it, duh.&rdquo; Ludwig
shrugged.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Everyone
was mumbling and grumbling except for Junior, who had no idea what
nonsense he&rsquo;d came home to.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mushroom
Kingdom Hospital South was an old western style three story building
with a hooded porch located at the foot of Mt. Rugged. There were a
few cars in the parking and lots of yoshi carriages. Otherwise the
area was barren. The wheels of the MKDCU van crawled to a stop in
front of the entrance, causing the janitor that was outside mopping
the porch to take notice. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
in tarnation are you doing &lsquo;round here, Billy?&rdquo; a red
shelled koopa troopa janitor with a long gray ponytail and blue smock
asked. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Parabilly
rolled down the drivers window. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re here to make sure
you&rsquo;re not procrastinatin&rsquo;. Missed a spot there!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">James
hopped out of the truck from the passenger side. &ldquo;So this is
that twin brother Probabilly, huh?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yup.&rdquo;
Probabilly dunked the mop inside the bucket. &ldquo;What brings you
all city folk down here?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
don&rsquo;t want to step foot in Toad Town again after what
happened..&rdquo; James answered vaguely. &ldquo;Anyway, here&rsquo;s
da crew.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yo,&rdquo;
Richard mumbled. He got out of the car with Wiggletron and Sebastian
also exiting the back seats.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Is
dis really where they rounded up all the Case X patients? What&rsquo;s
the report?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Probabilly
shrugged at James. &ldquo;All I know is that I&rsquo;ve been mopping
all day. Once word got out that soda was tainted, folks lost their
dern minds pouring it straight out of the cans to the floors,
spitting it out, and worse!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Probabilly
went back to work as the MKDCU entered the hospital. The lobby was
set up much like a saloon, complete with bar tables and barrels
everywhere. Mounted on walls were taxidermy (despite unsettling
implications in an anthropomorphic world), empty and dusty glass
bottles, random &lsquo;yoshi wrestling&rsquo; trophies, and pictures
of the staff holding record holding cheep cheeps on fishing docks.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Howdy
ya&rsquo;ll!&rdquo; greeted Rou T., the front desk Toad girl. She was
young, maybe a freshman in college, and two blonde ponytails stuck
out from under her cowboy hat. Her desk consisted of a fold up table
with a computer on it and a La-Z-Boy she sat in.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">James
showed her a badge. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re gonna need a full report of
the transfer, see?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She typed
a few things into the computer, which had a Mushroom rebel flag set
as the background wallpaper. &ldquo;We have &lsquo;bout fifty folks
here from that Case X business, and a few regulars.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
medical records from Mushroom Kingdom Hospital East verified there
were approximately sixty,&rdquo; Wiggletron said.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Rou T.
typed something else in. &ldquo;Sorry folks, I forgot! Our head
nurse, Sheriff Jr. Troopa, sent a few to the Special World Hospital!&rdquo;
</font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daaaaang,
that place is crazy!&rdquo; Richard said.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sebastian
nodded. &ldquo;And my friend&rsquo;s cousin&rsquo;s uncle&rsquo;s
barber got sent there and never came back!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
have studied detailed accounts of their endeavors, and it does not
bode well for any patients involved,&rdquo; Wiggs said gravely.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hold
it boys,&rdquo; James said to his crew. He slapped on the desk a help
needed advert torn from a newspaper. It promised payment of real gold
coins for licensed medical practitioners to help out at the rustic
hospital. &ldquo;Dis still applies?&rdquo;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Several
robotic drones, resembling metallic flying mushrooms with arms,
wheeled a hand full of &lsquo;Case X&rsquo; Mushroom Flu patients
through the metal folding door of the International Medical
University of Special World. The red capped toad, suited in a white
doctor coat with black pants and his head lamp off centered, that
stood off to the side frowned when he realized there were no more
than ten to check off the list. He was Drew Louis Diddley PhD, or Dr.
Toad, the current president of the hospital.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sheriff,
didn&rsquo;t we talk on the phone about this?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Junior
Troopa, wearing a black cowboy hat, strolled over to him. &ldquo;Yep.
Sure did, partner. Ten. Just like you agreed.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What was
actually agreed were about half of the sixty confirmed cases of
Mushroom Flu, if the records at MK East were to be relied upon, but
Dr. Toad froze up. Jr. Troopa was just being the brat he always was
and he didn&rsquo;t realize that he needed this opportunity to study
Mushroom Flu patients because of its signature &lsquo;coma walking&rsquo;,
Dr. Toad reasoned. (It revitalized areas of the brain even if they
were degraded, like what could happen due to old age...or dementia.)
His attention was then brought to a taxi pulling up before the
hospital, presumably &lsquo;associates&rsquo;. It wasn&rsquo;t like
there were any other buildings around they could be visiting.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Stop
dreaming, Drew. We&rsquo;re pack&rsquo;n up. Yee-haw!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad&rsquo;s
eye twitched. &ldquo;</font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
Doctor Toad</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">,
but thanks anyway. I guess this will be enough for both a control and
testing group for I and others involved in the project.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;ll
be enough alright. Sharing is caring! After all, you ARE just making
them comfortable and not doing mad experiments based on some wild
theory you got, right?&rdquo; Jr. Troopa asked, nudging him.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Definitely.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Good!
See ya around!&rdquo; Jr. Troopa head back to the Southern hospital&rsquo;s
helicopters that were parked in front. They were unmarked so they
must have been rentals. Maybe he wasn&rsquo;t a brat after all if
they were willing to rent aircraft for their sake..</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Morris, or
&lsquo;Professor X-naut&rsquo; and his assistant Johnson came up from
the taxi, arms filled to the brim with papers and folders.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hello,
my dear fellow! I hope that I am not late,&rdquo; Morris said, with
the assistant close behind.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No,
not at all, rather. They just arrived. Umm, didn&rsquo;t you get my
text?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Morris
turned to Johnson, who nodded. &ldquo;Oh right! I did not pick up my
cousin until thirty minutes ago. Until then he was in his primary
school with the phone powered off.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
see. You know, this sort of thing wouldn&rsquo;t happen if I could
contact you through your own cellphone.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Me
owning a cellphone? Good one! That was just as funny as that comedian
I saw yesterday&hellip;&rdquo; Morris and the assistant made their
way in. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There was
nothing more to do than to join them. Dr. Toad shut tight the metal
doors and once more the hospital was isolated from the outside world.
Dealing with Troopa had tired him out socially and thus he needed
coffee. He went down a few hallways on way to his office when
something buzzed in his jacket pocket. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hello.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hello??&rdquo;
There was static in the background. &ldquo;Drew! I know you said to
not call you at work but I need a place to hide. Please..&rdquo; a
lowish kind of dry sounding voice begged.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
stopped in his tracks. &ldquo;Excuse me??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah.
Listen, I&rsquo;m kind of banned from Toad Town now and even worse, I
just woke up and saw dead people!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What??&rdquo;
</font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
know, bro. Don&rsquo;t ask how he pass, he was just there when I woke
up, but he did have this cool cell phone. By the way I&rsquo;m in a
train and I&rsquo;m hungry and this dead guy only had one stick of
gum and five dollars on him,&rdquo; the voice said matter of factly. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The toad
doctor found reason to be relieved, even though no sane person would
be. &ldquo;How much trouble are you in on a scale of one to ten?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Probably
one-hundred,&rdquo; the voice answered seriously.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
felt a chill. &ldquo;Oh&hellip; Knock on the left side of the
building when you get here. Okay? Bye.&rdquo; Dr. Toad slipped the
phone into his jacket pocket.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Drew,
are you alright?&rdquo; Morris asked, making Dr. Toad jump.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Uh,
sure. It was nothing. What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
left my medical bag in your office. I just wanted to catch you before
you were whisked away into some board meeting.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
led him to his private office, locked up very well as he couldn&rsquo;t
stand the idea of people going through his personal things. Inside
was sparse with his oak desk, basic chair, a few charts, a file
cabinet, and Morris&rsquo;s ratty bag setting on the desk, which was
promptly ignored by its owner.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
did not tell me you acquired a new painting from Pablo Pizzacaso, the
world famous painter and plumber!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The X-naut
PhD&rsquo;s attention was on a medium sized watercolor featuring two
humanoid figures beside each other. The image was split down the
middle: the left with a background consisting of black, blue, and
purple hues. A figure stood like a silhouette, dark and blending in.
The right side had lighter colors, red, orange, and yellow, but the
figure was still black like a silhouette. &lsquo;Divided&rsquo; was
inscribed at the bottom of its red frame.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
felt a sweat coming on. &ldquo;Oh you mean that. Umm, actually it's
mine, or I painted it rather. Yeah, I spent the past week working on
it at home. So.. what do you think?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
quite good. What does it mean, however?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
kind of personal. But thank you I guess,&rdquo; Dr. Toad said,
meaning it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Morris
turned around with his hands clasped. &ldquo;Fair enough... Do you
ever go out? You hardly leave the hospital and being the new young
president does not mean you must live here. Let me check if I have
coupons for my other job at Club Gamecube.&rdquo; Morris picked up
his bag and dumped the contents, syringes and other rusty medical
tools, on the desk. Dr. Toad winched as it put gashes in the wood. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ah!&rdquo;
Morris held up a wrinkly coupon. &ldquo;Buy one family special and
get a free entree.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
really should get going.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Fine,&rdquo;
Morris grumbled as he stuffed the equipment back in the bag. &ldquo;I
am just trying to help as a friend. It&rsquo;s unhealthy to stay in
all day. Very unhealthy, like the electromagnetic fields from phones,
airship chemical trails, and gluten products. Oh, if you ever stop
by, we put on shows. This dark boo named &lsquo;Z&rsquo; or
something, tore the place up with this jokes about Bowser&rsquo;s
Castle and how he could embarrass people on stage with furtive
details he already knew about them.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
grabbed him by the collar. &ldquo;What did he look like???&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Morris
laughed it off. &ldquo;Young, a few scars, kind of like a delinquent.
Maybe he will stop by again, don&rsquo;t get so wrapped up!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
let go and inched back. &ldquo;Y-you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he
stammered. &ldquo;Sorry I- Uh... Let me grab some coffee and I&rsquo;ll
meet you in the lab...&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
marked things off on a clipboard. A Bowser attack or not, the castle
still had to run itself. With Toad ill and Toadsworth retired,
general management fell on the castle manager: namely her.
Consequently she got up early and was constantly glancing at clocks
and watches and schedule boards and down the halls and up the halls
and even at the security cameras facing the castle&rsquo;s moat to
make sure things were running right. Judging by the fact that a small
fire broke out, the basement had a slow water leak, and no one even
knew where the cleaning supplies were stored, they weren&rsquo;t.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Deep
breaths, Toadette told herself. The Princess late last night gave her
permission to invite a trusted intern to help run the place and the
ding noise behind her meant that he was right on time. The elevator
opened up, complete with white steam pouring out. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ready
for adventure!&rdquo; Captain Toad announced. He had a plain and
youthful face, suited up with hiking clothes, a red scarf, a large
backpack, and a head light. Toadette was familiar with him from a few
treasure hunting adventures they&rsquo;d been on and his rescue
missions involving space.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hi
Ms. Toadette,&rdquo; he greeted, flashing sparkly white teeth. &ldquo;I
understand you need a brave warrior on the field?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">If
by field you mean the castle, sure. Where is the rest of the
brigade?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Captain
Toad pointed to his right bicep. &ldquo;Right here is all we need.
That, and I sent them on vacation. May I ask what I need to do?&rdquo;
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
hid the clipboard behind her back. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see&hellip; are
you good at putting out fires, general plumbing work, and locating
cleaning supplies?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yes,
yes, and yes.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They went
upstairs the very few weekend staff were scarce knowing that Bowser
would be showing up. Toadette only saw Buckenberry and Thomas the
castle&rsquo;s front door guard. The guard was off to the side
talking looking nervous and Buckenberry was heading right to them.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So
you&rsquo;re up to your job now?&rdquo; he asked, addressing Captain
Toad.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Indeed
I am! I&rsquo;m going to keep you all in order during another daring
adventure.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...Actually
your task is to help keep order INSIDE the castle.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
of course, Ms. Toadette. That I will do,&rdquo; Captain Toad
recovered smoothly.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Besides
Blue, I knew you and Gold would be busy outside with the Marios when
Bowser showed up and then probably off on an adventure or something
afterwards. Captain will be gone by the end of the day. Wait, where&rsquo;s
Gold?&rdquo; Toadette looked around. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Buckenberry
lost the defensive stance. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, he was still in
the bed when I left the apartment. I woke up this early morning and
he was blowing chunks in the bathroom.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
made a face. &ldquo;That was a bit too much info..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Captain
Toad faced her. &ldquo;He could be suffering food poisoning or a
virus. Or a mushroom overdose.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No
one asked you,&rdquo; Buckenberry said sharply. &ldquo;Enjoy your
indoors adventure, buddy.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Captain
Toad&rsquo;s face never changed from a wide, if not mischievous,
grin. &ldquo;I will, Mr. Buckenberry. Trust me.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Just then
everyone heard the low roar of a Koopa Airship. It shook the entire
castle and cast a shadow over it that could be observed from the
front foyer and mezzanine windows. The front door swung open to
reveal Luigi&rsquo;s worried face.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser&rsquo;s
here!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Buckenberry
head outside with Toadette (and Captain Toad) keeping a close eye out
from the safety of the windows.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario and
Peach stood right were the moat coming from the castle met the sandy
ground. Their hair and clothing blew in the wind as Luigi and his
toad companion joined them. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We&rsquo;re
giving Bowser the big news,&rdquo; Mario told everyone, his eyes not
departing from the airship that steadily drew closer. This one wasn&rsquo;t
the royal koopa family&rsquo;s typical ride. It looked worse for ware
with sour looking wooden boards and lots of squeaks in the air as it
made it overhead and landed right near the lake. Yellow dust stir up
and emerging from it was King Bowser himself with a black cloak on
that flow in the breeze still being generated from his ship. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Attention
Mushroom idiots!! And of course my lovely Princess...&rdquo; he added
at the end in a softer tone. &ldquo;You remember the ultimatum from
last night, right?&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
do,&rdquo; Mario answered.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
stepped forward to meet the king. &ldquo;Bowser, let us be brief. You
have affected my entire kingdom with your malicious ransom plots and
deadly alchemical ways, but we will not play your twisted game. We
are hopeful and we trust in the stars. The answer is no.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
readied his fists expecting some sort of conniption. Perhaps Bowser
would order an all out attack on the castle right then and there, or
he might try to run off with the Princess anyway. Bowser however
didn&rsquo;t have any other battleships with him other than the one
he arrived in, and instead of taking one step closer to the Princess,
he smiled the same toothy grin Mario saw a lot. Cruel, dangerous,
but... like an old vitriolic pal!</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That&rsquo;s
fine then, whatever. I was hoping you&rsquo;d say that &lsquo;cause I
had a change of plans anyway. There was a bit of mix up in the castle
so did y'all do good in science class? You see-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Bowser,
excuse me, but whatever are you talking about??&rdquo; Peach
interrupted.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
like this, hotness. Even if you gave yourself over to me, which would
be great if you did it anyway, just putting that out there, we don&rsquo;t
have the cure ourselves!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario,
Peach, Luigi, Buckenberry, and everyone eavesdropping from the castle
gasped.</font></p>

<blockquote><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
adventure continues!</font></blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
was just as surprised as you losers when the brats showed up,&rdquo;
Bowser turned back to his family. &ldquo;And get your butts up here!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The rest
of the koopalings and Junior quickened their pace to join Bowser and
stand around looking flustered, bored, or annoyed. If the toads
inside of Peach&rsquo;s Castle were nervous when Bowser first
arrived, they&rsquo;d be absolutely terrified by the amount of his
baddies on the castle grounds at once. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
picked his jaw up from the ground. &ldquo;Wait so-?!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
nodded. &ldquo;Yup, a rogue in the castle we guess. And nobody&rsquo;s
seen &lsquo;em since.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
my!&rdquo; Peach exclaimed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
stance remained rigid. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but I&rsquo;m not
understanding why we still shouldn&rsquo;t whoop all of you koopas
right here and now? Even if there was a mix up at the castle, which I
don&rsquo;t really believe, everything that&rsquo;s gone wrong is
still your fault!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Deafening
silence fell on the whole courtyard. Mario was unsure if only he
caught it, but there was a flash of hurt on Bowser&rsquo;s face
before returning to a mix of amusement and annoyance. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
don&rsquo;t know what else to tell you, plumber. All I wanted was my
freaking tennis match and I wouldn&rsquo;t be getting it if had a
scheme right now, would I? We&rsquo;re asking for your help and don&rsquo;t
think for a moment we&rsquo;d team up with you idiots if we didn&rsquo;t
think we had to.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...He&rsquo;s
right though,&rdquo; Luigi spoke quietly to his brother but stay
behind him, he and everyone else like Mario was the barrier between
them and the koopas. &ldquo;I thought about it and it doesn&rsquo;t
make sense for Bowser to betray us the way he acted, unless he was
actually a really good actor&hellip; But he isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
heard that, Green Mario!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
avoided eye contact in a standoffish manner. &ldquo;Fix this then.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So
it&rsquo;s settled! I, King Bowser Koopa, the supreme overlord of
Dark Land, am offering you mushroom freaks a truce just until we get
this whole mess straightened out. But after that it&rsquo;s back to-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
Junior put his hands to his neck in a guillotine gesture.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-No,
not that Junior! I mean we&rsquo;ll do the usual. Fight, argue, play
tennis, etc. Then start all over again when the next game comes out.
Deal?&rdquo; Bowser offered his hand being the sentimental person he-
wasn&rsquo;t! It was a great emotional moment, for five seconds.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach came
to Mario&rsquo;s side. &ldquo;I believe you Bowser. If this was
deliberate of you I feel you would not have missed the ample
opportunities you had to harm us.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No
problem, princess. I-&rdquo; Bowser&rsquo;s words were cut off when
the princess&rsquo;s dainty hands slapped him in the face. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-That
was for your carelessness and callous disregard for safety!
Regardless I, Princess Peach Toadstool, ordained ruler of the
Mushroom Kingdom accept your truce.&rdquo; She gingerly shook his
hand and regained her composure. &ldquo;Well, how shall we proceed?&rdquo;
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
rubbed his stinging cheek while pointing to Ludwig behind him. &ldquo;Just
ask him, he&rsquo;s the mastermind and all.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">May
I have a word with you two?&rdquo; the red faced koopaling requested.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah.
We can talk privately in the garden...&rdquo; Mario said, walking
away ahead of the others. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A moment
later&hellip;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey,
punks,&rdquo; Roy sneered the moment the coast was clear, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
think we&rsquo;re gonna be friendly with you chumps!&rdquo; His
siblings joined his protests and turned it into a shouting match
right in front of the castle.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
ran outdoors, being eager the whole time to do something...</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
closed the white garden gate behind him, being the last to enter. His
eyes for a moment darted about the garden impressively before
snapping back to Mario and the princess standing before the Eternal
Star fountain. Bowser impatiently waited with his arms crossed near a
rose bush across from them so Ludwig met in the middle.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
analyzed these samples this morning.&quot; Ludwig reached into his
pocket and delicately held between his claws a glass slide. &quot;I
have conclusively determined by the disease&rsquo;s structure that we
will need a number of molecules to open its disease lock. Are you
still following? No??&quot; Ludwig sighed arrogantly. &ldquo;We can
make a cure from scratch easily, but obtaining the components I&rsquo;ve
hidden may be the difficult part considering we are who we are, so it
would be very helpful for you all to assist. Simple enough?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
truce is a truce.&rdquo; Mario said, thawing from before. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Great.
One last thing.&rdquo; Ludwig handed the Princess a rolled up decree.
</font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
issued a death warrant in our Kingdom??&rdquo; She rolled it back up,
looking very displeased.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Erm,
yeah,&rdquo; Bowser said. &ldquo;Standard protocol in Dark Land for
an attack on royalty. Yeah, it&rsquo;s a stretch since he didn&rsquo;t
attack anyone directly, but don&rsquo;t ya think somehow convincing
Dark Land&rsquo;s commander in chief, that&rsquo;s my brat Ludwig, to
do whatever crazy thing he did- I still don&rsquo;t understand it
really, counts?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario and
Peach shared a cautious glance. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well
I do want him exterminated, even if I do not understand what Vater is
talking about.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario took
off his hat to wipe some sweat off his forehead. This was already a
hot day. &ldquo;What do we need to find?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
scratched his chin. &ldquo;There is a sample of stardust, a mega
vitamin, a boom shroom, and Yoshi fruit. I have a general idea of the
location but no specifics assuming they are still there. It was a
week ago when they were planted.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
will do this because the stars will be with us!&rdquo; Peach said,
beaming with determination and hope.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario,
without words, held out his hand. After a pause, a yellow scaly hand
met a white gloved one in a firm shake. &ldquo;This is to your stars
that guide your kingdom,&rdquo; Ludwig said with sincerity. &ldquo;After
all, we must try. Just know that our motley crew have officially
started the scavenger hunt.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
turned his attention to Ludwig. &ldquo;Great. Now, you go back around
first and wrangle our people up. I got things to discuss with these
two. So just this morning I got a message and...&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Their
words trailed off as Ludwig excused himself from the garden. The
diplomat came back to the front castle courtyard to find everyone
standing in a single file line in some some arbitrary order. Luigi
and Iggy were at the front, a disgruntled Buckenberry and Bowser
Junior in the very back, and everyone else in between. Off of the
side, Toadette waved.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hi,
Mr. Ludwig. I conveniently managed this situation for you!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He hummed
as he reconnoitered. &ldquo;It is Prince Ludwig to you, Ms. Toadette,
but no matter. Wendy, Larry, and Roy can quickly travel and get the
Yoshi fruit. Forgive me, but that is the only object I did not remove
from it&rsquo;s native location. Besides, their passports have not
yet expired as I recall. Buckenberry can keep Lemmy and Morton in
check while they search the mega department store where the vitamin
approximately is. Iggy can get the stardust hidden in Toad Town. He
has a mineral analyzing machine and knows the city because he visits
the comic shops alot. I will work with Luigi Mario to procure the
Boom Shroom that I believe is located somewhere in a forest, and he
has experience with things colored green so-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Ludwig!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
PRINCE Ludwig, and what?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
just undid my entire managing montage!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
shrugged as he passed her by. &ldquo;Does it matter Ms. Toadette? It
happened off screen anyway. Now Luigi, are you ready to depart?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
tried to put on a brave face. &ldquo;Okay, but where&rsquo;s the
rest?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
heard it all,&rdquo; Mario said, walking up with Peach and Bowser.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario,
Peach, Junior, and I have to go somewhere. I know it ain&rsquo;t like
me but I don&rsquo;t have time to argue. Go on!&rdquo; Bowser roared.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario run
up to Luigi and pat him on the back. &ldquo;Stay safe. You know how
spotty communication can be when out of the kingdom, so I&rsquo;m
making you the leader of this cure making expedition. Oh and can you
check out what Dr. Toadley wanted to show me?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah,
are you okay? You still seem peeved.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
shook his head. &ldquo;You know how I kept saying yesterday didn&rsquo;t
feel right? I woke up this morning and honestly, I feel even worse
about today. Interpret that how you want. Bye.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi saw
everyone scrambling about with apprehension. Now they were going to
work with not only Bowser but his family too? And with two key
heroes, Yoshi and Alagold, being absent?? </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
called him over to a Parade Kart stashed in the Airship&rsquo;s
loading bay, and they were off into Toad Town. The koopaling
traversed the streets somewhat like an angry senior citizen, honking
constantly at people zooming past him at the normal speed limit. They
were in the East side of the city and Luigi got a good look at a sort
of &lsquo;gang&rsquo; all wearing denim jackets with white t-shirts
under for the guys, and old school dresses for the girls. Luigi hated
ignoring it for other matters but that&rsquo;s the way things were.
Soon they arrived at the Toadley Clinic, a plain building modeled
after a mushroom.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi got
out first. &ldquo;Umm, thanks. I didn&rsquo;t think you overheard
what Mario said. Do you drive all of the time?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Never
actually. I usually get a servant to drive for me.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
explains a bit,&rdquo; Luigi thought as the two headed in.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
Toadley Clinic was empty except for a pink spotted toad at the desk.
She sat her magazine down at the sight of them.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hello?
Oh, yeah. I&rsquo;ll get the doctor.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mary the
intern disappeared behind the lab&rsquo;s double doors. Suddenly
screaming and clattering and ruckus came from back there in one
discordant jumble. The green plumber and koopa prince were
subconsciously inching closer to each other, so much so that their
shoulders brushed after the second explosion sound.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">My
apologies, plumber. Is this clinic always like this?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The double
doors burst open and Dr. Toadley emerged along with Birdley squawking
in alarm. Toadley&rsquo;s normally purple garb was blackened but his
thick eyebrows were raised in amusement.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Am
I very happy to see you now? Yes I am!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Doc,
are you okay??&rdquo; Luigi asked.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Am
I? Not at all!&rdquo; Dr. Toadley fell forward stiff as a board,
prompting them to rush to his aid.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Doc?!&rdquo;
Luigi rolled him over.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
quickly checked the doctor&rsquo;s pulse. &ldquo;I see no sign of
lasting damage, except that he has become insane!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
that part is normal.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There was
a pause. &ldquo;Oh...&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
guys will probably want to check this out,&rdquo; Mary said
reentering the lobby. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">S-should
you examine the results of my Miracle Toadley Cure?
Yes...you..should!&rdquo; Dr. Toadley added.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The human
and koopa duo cautiously entered the lab with their attention first
being brought to equipment, tables, chairs, and more being thrown and
tossed about, some even on fire. Luigi saw hunks of junk, but Ludwig
recognized the remnants of sophisticated computers. The next thing
however made then freeze in place. Toad and Daisy where on the other
side of the lab awake. Toad had a wide smile, only his skin looked a
little patchy and red. Daisy also had reddish patches on her normally
olive colored skin, that and she was standing upside down on her
head.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No
way!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Impossible!&rdquo;
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad said
some sort of gibberish while waving.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey
you two! What Toad meant was, he&rsquo;s glad to see you. Tell the
doc I&rsquo;m sorry I kind of wrecked the place. I was spinning like
a top a moment ago.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi ran
up to Daisy for a hug. &ldquo;You had no idea how much we all
worried. Uh, are you getting your handstand exercise in?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
brunette smiled, or frowned because she was upside down. &ldquo;Nope,
I can&rsquo;t help it. That&rsquo;s the other thing Weegee. Whatever
Dr. Toadley did to us was kind of weird. I mean, I&rsquo;m glad to be
awake but, yeah, we ain&rsquo;t exactly normal.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
shoved Luigi aside to get an even closer look. &ldquo;How can you
have a rash when NOT having a rash is a distinct symptom of MF?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Watch
it, koopa! What do you mean!?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
stood his ground, the two glaring at each other. &ldquo;Do you
understand why Mushroom Kingdom Hospital South cannot cure anyone
with Dr. Mario&rsquo;s Megavitamins? The Mushroom Flu strand that we
had in our lab mutated, I knew that, but I see now that there could
be more complications to it. Do you follow?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah,
sure,&rdquo; Luigi grumbled. He turned to Toad and Daisy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
call to the castle to get you guys picked up. I&rsquo;m sure you
don&rsquo;t want to hang in this place, considering that computer
over there is on fire.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Actually
I&rsquo;d rather stay. I did tear the place apart so it&rsquo;s only
right I help clean. I&rsquo;m full of energy anyway! YEEEAH DAISY!&rdquo;
Daisy did a somersault over to the engulfed computer monitor and
stomped out the flames. All that was left was a smoking pile of
plastic and electronics. &ldquo;Good as new!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig ran
over to it and tried to savage a microchip. &ldquo;You just destroyed
a very expensive-&rdquo; He sighed and shook his head.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">(I&rsquo;ll
take a ride, homeboys. The castle probably needs me),&rdquo; Toad
said. &ldquo;(Also has anyone seen my megaphone?)&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi was
relieved to tell him &lsquo;no&rsquo;.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Aww
raspberries!&rdquo; Kylie said when she woke up and it was nearing
noon. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Later she
was staring out of her window watching cars pass by and thinking over
her venturesome plans for the day when Emery&rsquo;s Koopa King cart
stopped by. The young nurse agreed to drive Kylie to MK South
hospital to check on Mitch, as she was out of a job anyway and mother
was in prison. The dire situation never came up in the girls tone
however, so Kylie accepted. When they arrived to the hospital near
Mt. Rugged things seemed calm from the outside and they parked not
far from a colorfully painted van abandoned in near the front porch.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Inside
seated were a few people in the reception area all drinking water or
tea due to the soda shortage. While Emery sat around, Kylie got the
attention of the desk lady. &ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am, I&rsquo;m looking for
Mitch Jamerson Toadstool.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Rou T.
typed stuff on the computer. &ldquo;Room 226. Make sure you don&rsquo;t
stumble into any rooms below that number. We&rsquo;ve had all kinds
of ruckus from the MF patients. You take care, hear?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
slowly pushed opened the door marked 226. The room was quiet save for
occasional beeps from machinery and a green capped Toad lie in bed
with a number of equipment hooked up, monitors, IVs, and even an
oxygen mask. Kylie felt her eyes become watery as she stood at the
edge of Mitch&rsquo;s bed for a moment, laying a hand on his. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mitch,
I know we both made mistakes. I&rsquo;m just sorry for never
forgiving you before, and I will hold back nothing until I avenge
you.&rdquo; There was so much more she wanted to say, but the words
could never come out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A few
minutes later, she heard the door creak behind her.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Umm.
Can I talk to you about something, or is this a bad time?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
discreetly wiped her face before turning towards her friend. &ldquo;Sure.
Here I come, sis...&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They went
back down the hall into the saloon/lobby area and sat on some
benches. Kylie didn&rsquo;t notice when she first came in, but now
she kind of liked the d&eacute;cor that most might consider kitschy.
For instance, above where they sat was a large imposing stuffed Dino
Rhino head mounted on the wall.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
snatched this crazy thing from a wall.&rdquo; Emery showed her a
crumpled &lsquo;WANTED&rsquo; poster of Zoo issued by Ludwig. It
promised a reward of a ridiculous amount of coins, so much Kylie
wondered if Bowser even had that much in his bank, unless his eldest
son was holding out. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">As
if I didn&rsquo;t have enough of a reason to hunt Zoo down. Remember
when I told you about that on the phone? He&rsquo;s the one who hurt
Mitch-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
look it&rsquo;s that celebrity, Kylie!&rdquo; Sebastian said, walking
up to the girls.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
almost didn&rsquo;t recognize her snifit &lsquo;fan&rsquo;. &ldquo;Still
the wrong Kylie, brother. But where&rsquo;s the rest of your gang?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We&rsquo;re
all stuck here doing random stuff like sedating Mushroom Flu
victims!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Emery
looked at him funny. &ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t we classmates in health
class? Yeah, you locked everyone in the community college because it
was raining hard one day and you didn&rsquo;t think it was nice to go
outside while the sky was crying so much.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yes,
and?&rdquo; He replied in a deadpan manner. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie slid
her contact card to him slowly. Sebastian in turn gave her his number
on a rainbow sticky note and disappeared as quick as he showed up.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
fella&rsquo;s odd. Good hearted, but odd. Now, I have to get going.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Emery&rsquo;s
bottom lip quivered. &ldquo;But, but can&rsquo;t I come along? You
need me to drive you around and I&rsquo;m going to be soooo lonely!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sis,
are you sure? Come on, your mom&rsquo;s at a prison hospital. I think
you should chill.&rdquo; Kylie thought she was making sense.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And
do what? She&rsquo;s doing okay, I called this morning and besides,
she put herself there by helping out that Doctor Professor guy. Gosh,
I thought you&rsquo;d understand!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
do!&rdquo; Kylie replied vehemently, detecting some bitterness in the
tone of her friend. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m about to deal with some
crazy crap. I just care about you and this is no joke.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
know it&rsquo;s not and I won&rsquo;t get in the way, okay? Let me
prove I can help you by this.&rdquo; Emery got out of her seat and
bow dramatically in the middle of the lobby with her eyes shut and
hands clasp together. There was a flash in the room as a light
descended from the ceiling and landed right in front of the two
girls. Rou T. rolled over the counter with a shotgun in hand.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Geno
waved. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just me, &#9825;&#9834;!?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh,
excuse me hun. You take care, hear?&rdquo; Rou T. put the firearm
away and strutted back to her front desk. Others in the lobby that
were attracted to the attention began to ignore them too. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wow...
he actually made it.&rdquo; Emery got up looking coy all of a sudden.
&ldquo;Hey, &#9825;&#9834;!? &ldquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sup,
Emery.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
blinked a few times at the sight of the blue clothed doll with a
price tag hanging from one of his arms. &ldquo;Either a few screws
are loose in my noggin or this is a prank and y&rsquo;all saps got me
good!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No,
and no. I just stop here sometimes. It has character. What&rsquo;s
going on?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
explained the best she could to a random talking doll out of nowhere.
</font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Call
me Geno, and I&rsquo;d be glad to help. That hasn&rsquo;t been action
up in the heavens in too long.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
started to pack her stuff up. &ldquo;Thanks a bunch. You a fan of
thrifting too, brother?&quot; she asked, seeing the price on his tag.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Geno shook
his head. &quot;To be honest I lost track of Geno while up in Star
Haven. I realized today that Gaz, the owner of 'Geno' grew up and
gave it away to an expensive collector. I sure they won&rsquo;t mind
me borrowing it.&rdquo; He produced a semi automatic super scope out
of nowhere and tossed it to Emery while holding a star rod for
himself. &ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
wanted to check out so and so first. I&rsquo;m trying to find out
where Zoo might be hiding out since he gotta be keeping distance from
Bowser. Thing is, we need to travel places fast.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Geno
snapped his fingers and in another blinding flash a Shooting Star
kart appeared right in the lobby. Kylie and Emery got in the back
seats as Geno drove. They zoomed straight through the wooden swing
doors, leaving marks all over the hardwood floor and shaking things
off the walls. Rou T. started screaming at them but the trio were
already on the dirt roads of Mt. Rugged by then.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dad
gummit, I just cleaned here!&rdquo; Probabilly, who entered the lobby
a moment after, threw his bucket and mop down. </font>
</p>
<hr/>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie,
Emery, and Geno walked up to the Donut Plains Juvenile Detention
Center, or rather Geno came near the door, and Kylie and Emery
tumbled inside because their insides were turned upside down by the
Shooting Star&rsquo;s light speed travel. The upside to having their
stomach rush to their brains was that they'd went from the Mushroom
Kingdom to Donut Plains in thirty minutes. Kylie and Emery approached
the front desk person while Geno stayed outside the door and told
them to move on while his gaze was directed towards the sky for some
reason, specifically where there was a black &lsquo;dot&rsquo;.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Howdy.
Do y&rsquo;all have records that go back to the 90s? We&rsquo;re
wondering about a Zoo Diddley admitted here as a child.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The chubby
super koopa with pink perception glasses and a grey sweater, smiled
sweetly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid to inform you that we don&rsquo;t
publicly release mental health records.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;But
I'm a nurse at MK East,&quot; Emery spoke up. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;The
one that was shut down last night? Poor girl.. I still can&rsquo;t do
much unless you have referrals.&rdquo; Her phone rung. &ldquo;Excuse
me.&rdquo; She picked it up and quickly pressed a button behind the
desk.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Two doors
swung open and out came a hammer brother busily checking the pockets
of his colorful tie dye doctor&rsquo;s coat. &ldquo;You know how I'm
always forgetting stuff in my shell. They get on me about it all the
time at my other office. Ah!&rdquo; He produced a card key from a
pocket. &ldquo;Go on and have your lunch break. I&rsquo;ll hold down
the front desk.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thanks
Dr. Topper,&rdquo; the receptionist said. She grabbed her purse and
went back through the doors he came from.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Topper
turned to Kylie with a kind face. He had an air of grandfatherly
maturity, though Kylie suspected based on the Pac-Man tattoo he had
on his arm that he was probably 30 to 40ish in reality like her. &ldquo;Why
hello, ladies. I&rsquo;m guessing you&rsquo;re here for the shy
little man back there?&rdquo; he asked, referring to Geno who&rsquo;d
entered a moment earlier.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yes
sir! We need your help, fella.&rdquo; Kylie winked at her friends.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Emery
dropped to her knees. &ldquo;Please please please! He&rsquo;s just so
bad, we can&rsquo;t handle it anymore!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Geno
stepped up and flashed a shiny little dagger. &ldquo;Of course. Only
the baddest,&rdquo; he hissed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Topper
smiled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s great. There are no lost souls here.. How
old is he? Is he in in school?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Emery got
up. &ldquo;Umm, twelve. Yeah, he scares everyone on the playground.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Topper
jotted something down on a memo pad. &ldquo;Where do you all come
from by the way?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Out
of town,&rdquo; Kylie said. &ldquo;So we really need to make sure
this is the right place for.. &lsquo;Beano&rsquo;.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Topper
glanced at his watch. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t I show you all around
and explain our juvenile behavior program?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And so
they followed the hammer bro in the doors. The room they were in next
was basketball court size and had lots of tables with young people
setting at them and a few TVs showing some kind of educational
program. It would resemble a typical youth recreation center if not
for the orange jumpsuits everyone wore. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Beano
can stay in here,&rdquo; Topper said. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Is
that safe?&rdquo; Kylie asked.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Completely,
as long as he puts that knife away. Now if you would follow me..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Geno, now
without the knife, was left in the room while Dr. Topper took Kylie
and Emery out of some doors on the other side. Geno looked around,
there were kids of all ages moping around with the distinct air of
how kids might behave while waiting around in detention. At least
that&rsquo;s how Geno thought things still worked; it had been a few
millennium since he was in school. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He sat at
a table with several yoshi kids watching Rex the Friendly Dino from a
television stand at the end. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hello
young one,&rdquo; Geno said gently to the child closest to him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A purple
yoshi preteen turned to him. &ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">How
are you?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Okay...
Are you new?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
am. The name&rsquo;s Beano. How is this place?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Beano,
huh? It's alright here I guess..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">OMG
THE TOYS ARE HERE!&rdquo; another kid at the table screamed. This
made everyone in the entire room turn to Geno. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What?
A toy? Me?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The purple
yoshi gave Geno a closer look. &ldquo;Hey, I see that price tag.
Darcy&rsquo;s right, this must be one of those new high-tech talking
models.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Geno
gulped as many kids got up to surround him. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Meanwhile,
Kylie and Emery were brought to an office where they spoke for a bit
and stalled on filling out the paperwork laying before them. Kylie
played with the ballpoint pen in her hands. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Say
doc, that&rsquo;s some really good info. Last question, what would
you do if a child could bring the Dark Star to Earth?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Topper
spun away from his computer screen. &ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie shot
up from her seat. &ldquo;-Because that&rsquo;s what Zoo Diddley did
about fourteen years ago!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Is
this some kind of joke?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Nope,
brother. I&rsquo;m Kylie Koopa the reporter and I&rsquo;m doing a
criminal investigation.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Just then
the alarm went off. Dr. Topper leaned over to pressed a button to the
side of him. &ldquo;Yes? What happened?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">All
of the kids in the game room have lost their minds over a random toy
someone smuggled in! Come quick doctor!&rdquo; it said.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Topper
traded a confused look for a serious one. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll deal with
you practical jokers later. Move aside.&rdquo; He brushed past them
and rushed out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
turned to Emery. &ldquo;Who would bring a random &lsquo;toy&rsquo;
into a place like this? Wait a minute&hellip;&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Back in
the room the purple yoshi laughed as the yellow disc spun them around
many times before fading out of existence. Another kid, this time a
rex, begged for it to be their turn next.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hold
on tight now.&rdquo; Geno performed another Geno Whirl of the
harmless variety for the next kid. Many children stood in line for a
turn, the TVs and other games in the room long forgotten. Dr. Topper
marched right in the middle of them and picked Geno up.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Who
brought this in?&rdquo; Dr. Topper asked sternly. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie and
Emery burst in. &ldquo;Wait, doc!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Geno
turned to them. &ldquo;Meet me outside.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Topper
then gawked at the doll in his hands. &ldquo;You talk?!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And
he does other cool things, Dr. Topper,&rdquo; Darcy said. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ooh
ooh yeah. He spun me on his spinny disky thingy!&rdquo; said a little
thwimp.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He&rsquo;s
dope, bro,&rdquo; said a monty mole.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah!&rdquo;
added a round goomba.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Goo
goo!&rdquo; said a really small blooper.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Topper
tried to find a name tag. &ldquo;Kids, you know you can&rsquo;t bring
outside toys here, but if you really like whatever this is, maybe we
can get one approved. Hmm, he seems so familiar. Alright, be good if
you want to take a trip later today.&rdquo; When Dr. Topper brought
Geno with him to the front desk again, Geno sprung to life and hopped
out of his arms.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Farewell,
Dr. Topper. You take really good care of the kids.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh,
thank you doll thing that talks&hellip; and knows my name. What kind
of batteries do you run on?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Two
CR&#9825;&#9834;!? cells.&rdquo; Geno did a piece sign and left.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Outside
Kylie and Emery where near the car with guilty looks.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Geno,
we&rsquo;re sorry we left you in that kids room!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Children
can be cruel,&rdquo; Emery said, looking shell shocked.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">But
I thought that was the plan all along?&rdquo; Geno held up a folder.
&ldquo;You know, you distract the doctor while I get these?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
opened the folder. It contained a detailed profile of Zoo from years
eight to twelve. &ldquo;Yoiks! How did you spy around the place? I
thought the kids had ya stuck there.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">While
entertaining them, I was not 'stuck&rsquo;. They are very nicely
trained by the way and it would have been a great place for &lsquo;Beano&rsquo;,
but I digress. I can be anywhere I need to be,&rdquo; Geno said, not
bothering to elaborate. &ldquo;Now hop in. I need to drop you guys
back off.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
frowned. &ldquo;But we need more clues.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Geno gave
her a thumbs up. &ldquo;Oh that file has everything you need and I
needed. Emery, you can keep that super scope btw.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Emery held
it above her head triumphantly.</font></p>

This is a formal (well not really) letter to the Mushroom Kingdom
service board. Another nurse was attacked and this time his arm was
permanently twisted out of it's socket. I currently go to high school
with him as a junior and the poor guy played sports. Ten our of
patients we can&rsquo;t keep stable, but at least they aren't &lsquo;coma
walking&rsquo; and attacking everything that moves. As for the aggros
like the ones that took my friend out, we&rsquo;re going to have to
restrain them like MK East. We&rsquo;re used to Yoshi wrangling so
this should work. I'm so glad I only gave the Special World Hospital
ten patients. No telling how those other lunatics would handle this,
especially Dr. Toad. Guy has skeletons in his closet. Fresh ones.</font></em>

Bond was on the roof of a diner in East Toad Town. Standing near the
streets and entering the building were people wearing blue denim
jackets, blue vintage dresses, and blue shoes. It was wear a certain
color day, and he&rsquo;d had missed the memo. The beaming sun was
already hot and put a glare on the radio&rsquo;s screen, constantly
blaring the reports of the local law enforcement, some mundane others
not. While only seeing one up close he&rsquo;d learned that there
were eleven victims of the &lsquo;Railway Killer&rsquo;, as one more
was found after the goomba. He had a theory in mind: Since half of
them did have some slight but nonfatal physical trauma before dying
by internal damage, the perpetrator could have use that &lsquo;death
ray&rsquo; as a last resort. Combined with the common theme of mass
transport someone or something wanted to get out of the Kingdom fast
and without too much attention. Bond closed the laptop and was
preparing to climb off the building&rsquo;s roof to join society
again as a so called civilian. He&rsquo;d just report this to his
agency and they were surely-</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Don&rsquo;t
do that, his heart said. A sinking feeling deep within said that this
was actually part of something bigger than he could ever imagine.
Instead of stopping at the portal to Super Spy HQ hidden in Toad
Town, his next stop was instead...</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Class and
sophistication met blue collar. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After
arranging for Toad to be sent to Peach&rsquo;s castle by Captain Toad
picking him up (Daisy insisted she stay at the clinic), it was back
to business. The sparkling gold Parade Kart driven by Ludwig
attracted much attention while cruising down the streets of Toad Town
where the average person could barely afford to not use public
transportation, let alone an older gas guzzler. Girls even took
pictures while they were at red lights, gushing over Ludwig, (Luigi
guessed they saw his blue jacket and got confused since they were
still on the East side of Toad Town with all the denim jacket
greasers), but also Luigi (so it wasn&rsquo;t all bad). </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The car
stopped right before the entrance of Forever Forest. Already the
&lsquo;locals&rsquo; were rustling in the thick green foliage. Luigi
suppressed a shiver.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">May
I remind you that time is not an infinite resource, plumber.&rdquo;
Ludwig checked his old looking wristwatch.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
hopped out. &quot;I have one like that too.&rdquo; Luigi rolled up
his sleeve to show off his own vintage time keeping piece.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
raised one eyebrow. &ldquo;Oh? That looks good.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thanks,
but I&rsquo;m sure yours gets the most praise, especially from the
ladies with you being a prince and all.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
only mumbled in reply as Luigi began to lean on a sign post warning
visitors to not get lost. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
should mark our trail. I know mushrooms and you can get spun around
hunting for them.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
scoffed and continued through the forest gates without Luigi.
&quot;Reiterating your credentials is superfluous. I even have
credits in Koopilius Kesler's Florilegium: The Book of Plants!&quot;
The koopaling&rsquo;s voice grew faint.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
entered the forest where the thick canopy made everything dim,
belying the fact that it was only late noon. &ldquo;That was not
nice!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well
you caught up, did you not? Look at this.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">But Luigi
could not find where &quot;this&quot; was. As he called Ludwig&rsquo;s
name he could feel the various creatures in the bushes watching his
every move, just waiting for him to make a misstep and become another
victim of the forest. Luigi strained his eyes to find any sign of
Ludwig on or off the path. Then, some distance into the forest,
leaves crunched and right after his ears rung when a bang went off to
his left. Woodland animals shrieked, cooed, and howled in reply, the
noises collectively coming from all around.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
braced himself and ran through a large shrub to investigate. On the
other side was Ludwig aiming his zapper at a horde of green fuzzies,
with a scorched black mark on the ground between them. At the sight
of Luigi the hoard scurried back into the greenery, apparently
finding the fight not worth it anymore. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Luigi?!
Thank goodness!&quot; Ludwig returned the zapper to it's holder. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
grabbed him tightly. &ldquo;I was so worried!! You could have gotten
lost and never found again, or those things could have eaten you
alive!!!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
stared back blankly. &quot;...I misjudged. I thought I saw- I&rsquo;m
sorry..&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi let
go and sighed heavily. &quot;Just stick with me, okay?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Very
well. I will do so.&quot; Ludwig's expression remained flat as they
marched back to the path, but he kept close to Luigi's heels and
every twig snap made his hand hover over the zapper holster.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There were
many atypical plants to be found in the forest, but none had the
peculiar yellow and black color palette of a boom shroom. Luigi knew
of a residential clearing up ahead where they could inquire of locals
and even safely split up for a moment. After all, he had the faintest
idea that maybe Ludwig wasn't used to working with others, but it was
just a hunch...</font></p>

Haters get hanged!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry&rsquo;s
fist knocked against the subway windows in beat with his &lsquo;rap.&rsquo;
He and his siblings were heading to the harbor to catch a ride to
Yoshi&rsquo;s Island for some authentic Yoshi berries (and for Wendy
to take some exotic Instaham photos).</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Knock
it off!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yo,
chill out. What else we gonna do? King Dad took our cellphones,
remember?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Roy
crossed his arms. He sat across from Larry with Wendy beside him,
their sister being engrossed with her cellphone that wasn&rsquo;t
taken away because she was daddy&rsquo;s girl. &ldquo;Fair point.
Huh. Hey, I hear Junior got a girlfriend.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
do?! Why, that little brat...&rdquo; Talk about embarrassing he
thought, but it could be worse. Larry was only 15. At least he wasn&rsquo;t
like Ludwig who was 23 and had never had a girlfriend.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah.
Boy&rsquo;s a player already. He might even rival me when he grows
up!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That&rsquo;s
so cruddy&hellip;&rdquo; Larry mumbled. &ldquo;Earth to ugly hag over
there, wake up!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wendy
threw a small tantrum. &ldquo;NOOO! Raven sided with the &lsquo;Chucksters&rsquo;
and that&rsquo;s totes traitorous,&rdquo; she thought out loud.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Roy turned
to her. &ldquo;You mean those wimps we saw walking around with the
denim jackets?!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Uh
huh, and yes I heard everything you two MANsplainers were saying...&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Everyone
felt the subway slowing down. Outside the window was completely dark
like all of the lights in the subway tunnel were out. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Why
is it so black out there all of a sudden?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wendy had
her nose in the air. &ldquo;Maybe it wants to be black, Larry. Is
anything wrong with that?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Subway
101, Toad Town to Surfshine Harbor, attention,&quot; the automated
intercom said. &quot;There will be delays in departing. Thank you for
your cooperation.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Aww
shell!&rdquo; Roy said. &ldquo;We sit in this stupid train all day
and now we gotta wait to get off?&quot;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Like,
my gosh. We&rsquo;re royalty and we don&rsquo;t have to stand for
this. I'm complaining to the staff.&quot; Wendy got up after dusting
the crumbs from her lap, (they briefly got something to eat before
boarding the subway at a diner that happened to be controlled by the
'Chucksters', so they had to endure denim jackets, rockabilly music,
and tall hair for about thirty minutes), and head for the door
heading to the next car.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;But,
Wendy-&ldquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She waved
a hand sassily at Larry. &quot;We don't have all day, sugar. I'm sure
if I offered them some of this bling-&quot; Wendy flashed a gold
chain hidden in her purse. &quot;Get what I'm saying?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
couldn&rsquo;t believe he was now being outdone by his big sister who
actually owned chains as opposed to just rapping about them. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Alright
sis. I'll knock some heads together if they get fresh.&quot; Roy got
up and joined her. They were leaving when Larry jumped up. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hey
wait for meeeeee!!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
koopalings passed a few cars to get to the front of this particularly
short and mostly unoccupied subway, so they only got stared at oddly
once or twice. Roy would always shake a fist and they&rsquo;d knock
it off real quick. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Halt,&rdquo;
said the orange Yoshi attendant guarding the next door. &ldquo;You're
not allowed past here.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Roy used
the fist shake technique, but the attendant flashed a sharp looking
katana and Roy was the one who knocked it off real quick. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
stepped up. &ldquo;We just want to speak to the conductor or
whatever!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The yoshi
held the blade steady. &ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s busy back there so-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Aaaaahhhh
they're breaking the glass!!!&rdquo; screamed someone inside the
doors behind him. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
attendant whipped around and pushed open the next door only to let a
few black creatures who were pressing against it spill out. They were
flat and fuzzy with yellow oval eyes in the center. The attendant
realized his error and shut the door just a moment too late, so
everyone dodged back.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Roy slid
the sunglasses down again for a better look. &ldquo;What the shell
are those freaks??&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They're
all jittery and, eww!&rdquo; shrieked Wendy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
thought for a split second. &ldquo;Are these.. smorgs?&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The yoshi
sliced at them to little avail as the paper thin monsters continued
to slide through the gap in the door.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Save
yourself, kids!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
attendant pushed everyone out to lock himself in with the smorgs.
While his siblings scrambled away Larry tripped on his toes, feeling
something brush against them at the same time. In his panic,
firecrackers he had in his pockets that he used to pelt the vehicles
of people he didn&rsquo;t like in high school fell to the ground and
exploded, making purple, green, and blue flash in the car like a
strobe light at a party. By the time the smoke cleared, the smorgs
that had gotten through were reduced to black piles of ash on the
floor. Small successes, except more of them were coming and they
didn&rsquo;t seem happy. With a squeal he hoped no one heard, Larry
finally joined everyone else in the farthest car back. When he got
in, Roy and a Thwomp passenger in a business suit leaned against the
door right away.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Where
were you?? They can slip through the gaps any moment!&rdquo; Wendy
stood on her seat like one would to avoid a little mouser in the
kitchen.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
frantically dug into his backpack.&ldquo;Guys, we can roast these
losers. I got&hellip; exactly one more... Dang! Now I remember that I
cleaned out this backpack to make room for Iggy&rsquo;s womanizing
spray prototype- I mean my own manly musk!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
idiot!&rdquo; Wendy said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re screwed then!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry beat
a fist to his chest. &ldquo;Not just yet. Let a real Koopa man handle
this like- Ahhhh watch out!!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Some of
the smorg slid under the door, piling up at the feet of Roy and the
thwomp before flipping themselves upward to attack. Larry tossed the
last firecracker like a grenade and heroically saved both his brother
and a random passenger. No, actually the firecracker slipped from his
claws while he screamed like a girl and the entire fireworks show
went off at his own feet, disorienting everyone in the car. The first
thing Larry saw as the world faded back into view were ashes
everywhere and a big open window to his right that someone pried
open. Roy broke him out of his daze by reaching in and yanking him
out onto the hard concrete outside. They were at the harbor.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
told you to move instead of standing there when I opened that window,
stupid!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
would have had some choice words for his brother was he not struck by
the sight of the entire Toad Town 101 subway train being covered in
smorgs. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Let&rsquo;s
get out of here before this commotion delays our ship,&rdquo; Wendy
said, checking her phone for the time.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;m
sorry to inform you that it has. The Sarasaland government has
restricted all import and export with the Mushroom Kingdom,&rdquo;
the officer told them once they&rsquo;d entered the registration
office that was a short walk away. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
can&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; Larry said. &ldquo;Uh, is what I WOULD
say if I paid attention in government class&hellip;. Which I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wendy
winked at her brothers and pulled out the gold chain again. The
bandit officer then showed them his chain, which was bigger, more
gold, and fancier than Wendy&rsquo;s.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
pound his fist in his hand. &ldquo;We need to group up, yo. Wish I
had my scepter.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah,
sugar. Or we should sent him to the dungeons.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
think I can take this punk. I have a spiked brass glove and-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
officer interrupted Roy by clearing his throat loudly. &ldquo;You
realize that I&rsquo;m still here, right?...&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey,
lay off! I deserve to get a call don&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; a green
dinosaur named T. Yoshisaur, also known as Yoshi, said around the
corner as a doogan and toad officer escorted him. Yoshi was left at a
payphone where he dropped his bag to the ground with a sour look.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry left
his brother and sister with the officer at the desk, and stood around
where Yoshi was. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">..Yeah
Birdo, I might be away for a little while. Love you, bye.&rdquo;
Yoshi hung up and jumped a little. &ldquo;Larry?? What are you doing
here?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Don&rsquo;t
you know about that truce with my homies and your homies? You missed
the show.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He laughed
bitterly. &ldquo;I sure did, you know, hiding myself on a cheep cheep
fishing boat because they won't let anyone from Yoshi's island, or
any other country visit the Mushroom Kingdom!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
started. &ldquo;So they really did do that?&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And
I would have gotten away with it, had those alien things not attacked
and made all of the sailors check their ships.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
almost showed some sympathy before he caught himself. &ldquo;I got a
plan,&rdquo; he said as cool as he could. He saw his brother and
sister and everyone else not in the office anymore.&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t
you escape with us and we head to the castle? You got the berries we
need for the Mushroom Flu cure in your backpack and I&rsquo;ll
explain the rest on the way.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
smiled. &ldquo;You'd really help me out? Umm.. how did you know I
brought berries?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
rummaged through your stuff while you wasn't- I mean, just a guess!
Here, wear this.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi put
on Larry&rsquo;s large blingy gangster ball cap and tilted it down to
cover his eyes. For the first time Larry could notice how nice
Surfshine Harbor was outside, with it's deep blue ocean, sandy shore,
old school beach houses, and absolute tranquility, save for an odd
low rumble in the background.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
froze in this tracks and Larry bumped into him before seeing what he
was seeing. Back near the subway station, Toad Town 101 had
transformed into a half machine half organic &lsquo;thing&rsquo; that
stood upright. The five subway cars where joined together by a center
mass of smorg and entrapped people. Among the monsters where the a
passengers, officers, sailors, Roy, and Wendy. The five subway cars,
now black instead of the silver color they previously were, stuck out
to make a five pointed shape, ostensibly like a star. </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
dark star.</font></em></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
went outside and they spread everywhere!&rdquo; Wendy screamed.
&ldquo;Could you totes help us right now?!?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The middle
portion then pulled its victims inside of it where they were no
longer in view. Yoshi looked from side to side, but saw no other soul
anywhere, not on sidewalks or on the streets. Surfshine harbor had
become ghost town harbor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
faced Larry. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what this thing is but let&rsquo;s
&lsquo;totes&rsquo; help them, to quote your sister.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
curtains fell and the battle began Paper Mario style. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
looked at his attacks: flutter, stampede, and egg. His special attack
was &lsquo;wisdom&rsquo;.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry had:
Rap, shank, wand (greyed out), and &lsquo;closeted book nerd&rsquo;
as a special attack.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
tossed some eggs at the smorg, but didn&rsquo;t even put a dent on
the subway cars the 100 foot monster was made up.. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
squinted at he looked upwards at the behemoth. &ldquo;Use your tattle
thing.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
pulled out his smartphone and flicked through a few web pages until
he found the info he needed. He paraphrased: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a
&lsquo;Smorg&rsquo; and they all gather up and junk to make a bigger
monster like a gang bang or something. Max Hp ??? Huh, this one must
be special like the Armored Harriers. Attack is 500 though, wtf?
Defense 1 like normal. Attacks with tentacles like Iggy&rsquo;s weird
cartoons. Yeah, we should probably kill this thing quick&hellip;&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Now it was
the smorg&rsquo;s turn. It fell on top of Yoshi and Larry with the
center part hitting them directly. Immediately Larry felt like he was
drowning in some kind of slick papery material and flailed, feeling
nothing at all, until his hand brushed something smooth like a
necklace.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Or Wendy&rsquo;s
gold chain! </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wendy?&rdquo;
Larry called.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;m
over here!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Over
where? Are we moving?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Roy had to
slide his sunglasses up his face. &ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m here I think
and I&rsquo;m upside down!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Guys?
This is Yoshi. Now we aren&rsquo;t really inside this freakshow are
we?</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What?!&rdquo;
Wendy gasped. &ldquo;So we&rsquo;re dead already?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
noooo. I want my mommy- I mean MONEY.. because I loaned some out and
uh-&ldquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry,
quit it punk!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Okay,
ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Who
was that?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah,
who just answered for me?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Me,
ladies and gentilement.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You&rsquo;re
Larry too?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">This
is totes confusing.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;m
an attendant,&rdquo; the Toad attendant, also called &lsquo;Larry&rsquo;
said, &ldquo;and these things appeared out of nowhere and burst
through the glass.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi ate
a bulb berry from the bag he had on him, recognizing the fruit he
wanted by smell. The dragon&rsquo;s green skin turned yellow and his
entire body emitted a bright warm color that revealed the koopalings,
the attendant, and others off in the distance. They were all floating
in a dark void while a distant roar could be heard from somewhere
near yet far. Roy was floating and spinning around in place. Wendy
was stationary while upside down, which is how the golden chain fell
out of her bag. Larry was upright and still had the chain and Yoshi
and the attendant were on their side. People in the distance were in
random orientations. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Whatever
this is, we need to burn it. Too bad we just happen to be some of the
non fire breathers,&rdquo; Larry the koopaling said. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
pinched between his eyes before facing everyone. &ldquo;Listen up.
Give me that flashlight, something reflective, something that can
chain things together, and something protective you can put on your
hand.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Everyone
blinked. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
know what I&rsquo;m doing, trust me,&rdquo; Yoshi assured.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry the
attendant tossed his flashlight to discover that the void had
moon-like physics. Wendy tossed one of her million mirrors. Roy gave
up some super large brass knuckles, while resisting the urge to hurl.
Larry Koopa gave up the gold chain after one more longing glance and
the last thing floated over to the glowing dinosaur. He combined
those items with a zapper mini that was in his bag. This surprised
everyone but Larry Koopa, who&rsquo;d been through his nap sack
anyway (and snatched twenty coins while at it.) The extra batteries
from the flashlight added power to the zapper and the chain held the
mirror right in front of the barrel. Lastly he put on the brass glove
and aimed the modified weapon in a direction that wasn&rsquo;t
pointing at anyone. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sir,
what are you doing?!&rdquo; Larry the attendant questioned. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
mirror will cause the laser to rebound in the barrel like a freaking
bomb. Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m a professional crazy dinosaur.
Ready?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No!&rdquo;
Everyone, even those floating around a distance away collectively
shouted. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Geronimo!!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">In a
blinding flash the small flame from the zapper spread everywhere,
like the air inside the void was flammable. As the creature collapsed
on itself, Larry thought his skin was going to melt off, but that
didn&rsquo;t even compare to the deafening cry of agony from the
monster. The rumbling shook him to the bones as the rift between the
regular world and their dimensional imprisonment was shattered. As if
that was all a bad dream, the next thing he remembered was twenty or
so people including his siblings and Yoshi right back at the
Surfshine Harbor subway station amid piles and piles of black ashes.
The pieces of the subway were tossed about like a toddler playing
rough with toys. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi was
shaking and blowing on his right hand with the metal glove off to the
side glowing red. He moved his mouth but no words came out. Larry for
a moment feared he was deaf before he heard the regular sounds of the
city behind him. Cars driving. People walking. All of it had appeared
out of nowhere and the harbor was back to life.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The four
stumbled away from the scene and jumped into the closest Mushroom Bus
on route to Royal Raceway, white as a Boo. Their narcosis disposition
matched everyone else involved, so much so that the evening news
report would be unable to cover the incident properly, especially
with there being mysteriously, improbably, no outside eye witnesses.
Channel 64, somewhat annoyed, had to put yet another curious incident
down as an &lsquo;Act of Eldstar&rsquo;. The overhead shot of the
ashes shaped like a star were a conversation starter however.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So
everyone on the task of getting cure ingredients were long gone
except for Iggy, because he needed bathroom breaks inside. And
snacks. And he goofed for a while. But eventually he was back in
front of the castle just in time for a yellow toad to show up.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Whoa,
you&rsquo;re Iggy!&rdquo; Alagold said, not alarmed in the slightest.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
am! Are you my secret rival?&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Umm,
no he&rsquo;s just late for his shift,&rdquo; Toadette said, not
paying any attention to the fact that Alagold looked pale and sickly.
&ldquo;You missed a ton of stuff. Basically...&rdquo; Toadette
explained things not so basically but somehow Alagold got the point.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So
can I work wit him? It&rsquo;ll be AWESOME to work with you!&rdquo;
Iggy towered over the yellow toad beside him. &ldquo;I remember the
time you invaded my fortress like how Koru wiped out the Super
Plumbers in Koopa Ball Z!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thanks?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy
wheeled a bike from the Airship. It was lime green with two thwimps
tied to it by rope about ten feet behind. The thwimps wore headbands
with wires and blinking led lights attached to him.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-So
we&rsquo;ll ride around and the seismic activity recorded every time
the thwimps hit the ground will tell us if stardust is in the
vicinity! Wanna ride??? I&rsquo;ll let you drive because I need to
pay attention to this soundtrack so I can learn the lyrics for when I
perform &lsquo;Super Plumber Sonata&rsquo; at this upcoming
comic-con. Also whenever I drive, someone always manages to get hit
by a car, even if it makes no sense. But it&rsquo;s okay, last time
it happened the guy didn&rsquo;t have any friends or family anyway.
No biggie...&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Before
Alagold could respond, Captain Toad pulled up to them in Toadworth&rsquo;s
fake wood grain adorned station wagon. He rolled down the window.
&ldquo;Greetings Mr. Ala-Gold and Iggy Koopa.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey,
is that Mr. Toad back there?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
raised down his window in the backseat. &ldquo;(Hey, Gold. You don&rsquo;t
gotta be proper. How&rsquo;s the castle?)&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Alagold
leaned into the window. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t know!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
terrible!&rdquo; Toadette shouted from the distance. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Be
careful, man.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
agree..&rdquo; Captain Toad said, eyeing Alagold from the rear view
in a slightly vexing way, but no one really noticed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Captain
Toad left to park around back as Alagold examined Iggy&rsquo;s bike
closely. He didn&rsquo;t see any rockets or anything else illegal
about it, so it was all good. He also wasn&rsquo;t deathly sick from
overdosing, so that was better. &ldquo;Neat. I&rsquo;ll drive it.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
thwimps tethered to the bike pounded the ground in rhythm as they
made it from Royal Raceway to downtown. When coming up on the first
busy street Alagold realized that there were no brakes!</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Whoa
dude, what&rsquo;s wrong with your bike?!?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy took
out an earbud. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s this a fixed gear bike. Aren&rsquo;t
all of your bikes like this?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Noooooooo!&rdquo;
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They shot
through an intersection, making cars swerve to avoid collision. On
the next sidewalk they ran over YoshiMobile phone stands in front of
a business and almost hit someone dressed as the Statue of Mushroom
in front of a tax company building. Finally the bike ran out of
momentum right before a red cross light.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Alagold
was still hyperventilating when he realized that he&rsquo;d held on
so tight his little fingers wore grooves in the handlebar's grips.
&ldquo;That was awesome- I mean, AHHHGH!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Why
did we stop, Alagold-san?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Do
you know how to stop this thing? Yes? Then have at it, bro. Just
don&rsquo;t run people down again.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Have
it your way!&rdquo; Iggy sang. They rode once more through Toad Town
at breakneck (possibly literally) speed, only Iggy had complete
control with the fixed gear bike. The thwimps continued to work
behind them and alarm noises came from their headbands right as they
passed the Mushroom Junkyard.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy skid
to a stop and then slid his glasses up on his nose. &ldquo;I should
have known because this place does glow green at night occasionally.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
are we looking for again?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Stardust
is going to look like an ugly odd shaped rock. Luddy probably would
have hidden it with others like it.&rdquo; Iggy pulled out a flashy
ray gun in rainbow neon colors. &ldquo;Awesome-sauce, I remembered to
bring my limited edition &lsquo;Cowboy Boom Boom&rsquo; ray gun with
real vaporizing action!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After Iggy
whistled and got the thwimps to calm down, they parked the bike
behind a broken down car and quietly tiptoed through the junk yard.
They bypassed stuff from old mushroom buses, to kitchen appliances,
to billboards advertising long past events like Mario Parties and
other sports. Curiously, Alagold noticed a lot of discarded Fungus Up
signs and memorabilia looking really fresh and newly dumped. Soon he
saw a pile of orange bricks. The kind that Mario might frequently
break on an adventure.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
about those, bro?&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hmm.
No no no. We&rsquo;re talking more like meteor rocks, remember?
Nothing square or rectangular or any normal polygon shape.&rdquo;
Iggy jumped up and down and started pointing. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a
rock pile that would be perfect~&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Alagold
turned to where Iggy was talking about and recoiled. &ldquo;What in
the home-for-infinite-losers are you thinking?!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The area
ahead of them with lots of broken green, red, and yellow pipes laying
either on their sides or upright with a huge black chain chomp snored
right in the middle of it all. Black rocks were scattered about
everywhere.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Alagold
muttered things under his breath. &ldquo;Weird, are junkyard chomps
usually red? Alright, just cover me.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Sure.
Can I use my ray gun now??&quot;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Not
yet.&rdquo; Alagold was sneaking around pipes with the caution of a
Fire Snake when the chain-chomp stirred, freezing both toad and
koopa. Alagold wiped the sweat from his forehead when it only turned
over a slept once more. He shoveled out one last mound of dirt from
the pipe and gasped at what he saw. &ldquo;This might be it. Catch!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy
caught the dull grey rock. &quot;Yup. 100% unrefined stardust! Here,
take a close look.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After
Alagold climbed out and dusted himself off he held it. &ldquo;Umm,
why is it glowing like this?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
mildly radioactive, duh! Cool right?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Alagold
glanced down at the mineral in his hands with some worry before
smiling. &ldquo;Totally cool, bro.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
retraced their steps with the rock. Alagold stared at the sky when he
noticed a star up there, but it didn&rsquo;t twinkle like normal,
rather it was dark like someone poked a pin-sized hole in the sky
with a needle. Seeing stars in the daytime was always kind of weird,
so his mind drifted off thinking about the cosmos when his phone
started to vibrate, coming from Mario. By the time he picked it up,
it was already sent to voicemail.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey
Gold,&rdquo; Luigi said. &ldquo;Mario and I grabbed each other&rsquo;s
phones this morning by mistake. Anyway, I was just checking on
everyone. Larry&rsquo;s group won&rsquo;t answer nor Buckenberry&rsquo;s.
I sent a text to Mario but no reply yet. If you hear anything let me
know. Stay safe.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lame.
I blame YoshiMobile for the dropped calls,&rdquo; Alagold said to
himself.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There was
silence in the junkyard&hellip;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Then the
chain-chomp&rsquo;s eyes snapped open, revealing </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">starry</font></em>
<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">shaped
pupils. &ldquo;BARK BARK BARK!&rdquo; echoed through the entire five
acre dump. Ground and various junk around them rattled as the chomp
bounced their way so Alagold and Iggy screamed and ran as fast as
they could. As they followed the winding path back to the start, the
chomp plow through the junk walls straight to them like a heat
seeking missile.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Over
here! Trust me!&rdquo; Iggy said. The tall koopaling hopped inside of
a barrel, one of many piled up next to discarded Mario party 2
posters.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Alagold
prayed and jumped in one next to Iggy&rsquo;s. His heart was pounding
when the chomp reached them, complete with is loud barking and the
earthquake like bouncing. After what felt like forever, the noise
moved away until everything became silent. Alagold had no idea how
long he&rsquo;d held his breath when Iggy nearly made him wet himself
by violently shaking his barrel.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Come
on, Alagold-san! The coast is clear.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Alagold
slowly got up and looked around. &ldquo;I owe you one, bro. How&rsquo;d
you know?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well,
I saw that Mario Party stuff and there&rsquo;s this mini-game called
Sneak &lsquo;n&rsquo; Snore,&rdquo; Iggy explained. &ldquo;I figured
if barrels worked in that game, it might here.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
reached bike, never hearing the chain chomp again. Iggy whistled and
the thwimps returned to life, hopping along as Iggy wheeled it out of
the junk yard to terrorize Toad Town traffic once more.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...That
is, until they stopped in front of a McGoombas.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So they
parked the bike, subdued the thwimps, tied the stardust rock to the
bike, then walked into the fast food restaurant like nothing had
happened. Alagold ordered a small combo and Iggy the happy meal. They
were setting down near the window and eating for a while.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
know, you&rsquo;re okay for a pesky Mario fiend,&rdquo; Iggy spoke as
he played with the toy. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Alagold
chuckled. &ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re alright too. Go with the flow,
as Mr. Toad would always tell me.&quot;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Why
did you show up late? That pink toad chick made it a big deal.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
had this bad dream last light where this star was attacking us and
junk. Then I woke up in the middle of the night and in the dark took
a few too many of my anxiety pills. I&rsquo;m still alive, so
whatever.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
finished their meals and went outside where a bandit was snooping
around the bike.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey,
dude. That&rsquo;s ours!&rdquo; Alagold told him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The bandit
brought out a knife which made Alagold back up, but Iggy shot his
&lsquo;toy&rsquo; gun and the laser made the bandits robe catch on
fire.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">AHHHH!!&rdquo;
the bandit screamed running away from the restaurant and into a
street where he got hit by a car and created a huge scene. It was
okay though, because he had no friends or family.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy
turned to Alagold with an &lsquo;I told you so&rsquo; look. &ldquo;See?
This is what happens when I drive...&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Buckenberry,
Lemmy, and Morton went to the Mushroom Mall where in the Adidams (All
Day I Dream About Mario Sports) store, Morton talked the clerk into
letting him get some five hundred coin Air Koopa sneakers on a credit
card that definitely wasn&rsquo;t in his name. Lemmy took a quick
look through the toy store. Buckenberry tried the vitamin shop, but
they didn&rsquo;t have the kind Ludwig specified, so the hidden
object must have been somewhere else.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Does
your brother shop around?&rdquo; Buckenberry asked. He then ripped of
the paper on his back that said &lsquo;Kick Me&rsquo;, one of Lemmy&rsquo;s
many pranks against him. Morton hadn&rsquo;t done anything yet other
than laugh annoyingly whenever Lemmy did and put things on Bowser&rsquo;s
credit card.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
book store!&rdquo; Lemmy said, bouncing along on his ball and nearly
knocking people over.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Or
the cafe! The Starmanbucks. The overpriced coffee shop,&rdquo; Morton
added, sweaty from the normal walking pace.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
think those are in the same building. Here Lemmy, take my hand,&rdquo;
Buckenberry said, noting how crowded the mall was and for good
reason. Police inside warded off gangs, so it quickly became a
sanctuary for the normal people left in Toad Town. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy took
Buckenberry&rsquo;s hand, shocking the toad. &ldquo;Got you!&rdquo;
Lemmy giggled. &ldquo;Besides, I&rsquo;m like, twenty-two. I&rsquo;ll
be okay.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Whaaaaaaat?&rdquo;
Buckenberry was so distracted he walked smack into the glass window
of the bookstore. This really wasn&rsquo;t his day.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Inside the
three split again. Lemmy went to the children&rsquo;s coloring
section, Morton went to the celeb news magazines, and Buckenberry
searched for the college text books. There were many on all subjects
that he couldn&rsquo;t pronounce and they were heavy as well.
Buckenberry scooted a pile over too roughly and the entire thing
toppled like an avalanche. The book keepers gave him the dreaded &lsquo;be
quiet&rsquo; look but he couldn&rsquo;t stop yet. He got the idea to
look in between and under the shelves. After crawling around long
enough to get more displeasing looks and pain in his back, he&rsquo;d
found a little white pill bottle right under the shelf where the
&lsquo;ancient texts&rsquo; section was, only his arm stopped a
little short to reach. He&rsquo;d need someone smaller and acrobatic
for that&hellip;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy,
check this out,&rdquo; he said, coming up behind the rainbow haired
koopaling who was currently invested in a jumbo sized color by number
book. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy put
the book down. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
found it, just help me reach.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That&rsquo;s
it? Okay!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Buckenberry
turned to follow but tripped on his face because someone had tied his
shoelaces together. He rolled his eyes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Later, the
three left the mall with the special vitamins in hand. They were on
the sidewalk and Buckenberry didn&rsquo;t see Lemmy&rsquo;s polka-dot
painted B-Dasher anywhere.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
looked guilty all of a sudden. &ldquo;I just remembered something. I
was parked in the sixty minute limit zone and I think we probably
took about... a million minutes.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Aww
man!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So the
trio had to walk (or rolled) several blocks in the hot sun,
occasionally crossing the street to avoid shady looking groups of
people wearing denim jackets. Buckenberry really wanted to make a
phone call, but his cell phone was out of minutes as usual, Lemmy&rsquo;s
phone was a play phone, and Morton didn&rsquo;t even have that.
Eventually a blue pianta with the leaves on his head styled in a
pompadour kept staring at Morton&rsquo;s shoes as they passed. He
grabbed Morton by the arm, while his co-horts, rough but burly
looking noki, pianta, and strollin stu men and women stood back. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Eh,
Buddy. Why don&rsquo;t you lend me those nice blue shoes!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Morton got
a glimpse at the switchblade in the pianta&rsquo;s other hand and
froze up.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
rolled near cautiously. &ldquo;Umm, King Dad will get mad if-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The pianta
noticed Buckenberry and let go of Morton. &ldquo;Hey, even better
idea. I want those vitamins too, or I&rsquo;ll toss ya so high in the
air you&rsquo;ll squash like bugs!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Who
are you guys anyway?&rdquo; Buckenberry asked.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
Chucksters. My brother&rsquo;s in the hospital now so I&rsquo;ve
vowed that people like us, the working class, the blue collar, ain't
gonna be taken for a fool ever again, especially by &lsquo;baddies&rsquo;,&rdquo;
The Chuckster said, eyeing the Koopalings in particular.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Buckenberry
didn&rsquo;t grasp the significance of any of that he just wanted a
fight. He lunged for the pianta, knocking him flat on the pavement.
Buckenberry delivered a swift right hook before he was &lsquo;chucked&rsquo;
away into the grass. Right when Buckenberry got up, a random car sped
down the street towards them. Lemmy and Morton dodged away from the
street as the car ran over the sidewalk edge and hit the pianta that
was just getting up in broad daylight. Now his body was &lsquo;chucked&rsquo;
into the grass right next to Buckenberry, complete with his neck
twisted at an angle.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
just pounced THE Chuck!&rdquo; one gangster, a girl Noki in a blue
dress screamed. She and the others ran away. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
gasped. &ldquo;I-is that guy?-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Morton
covered his eyes. &ldquo;Yep. He is gone, perished, splattered on the
ground, literally.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Buckenberry
whipped from the pianta&rsquo;s body to the car, recognizing it as
the old station wagon Toadsworth would drive around before he
retired. The window rolled down to reveal Captain Toad, beaming with
a bright white smile. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hello
everyone. Why don&rsquo;t you jolly fellows hop in before the cops
arrive? I insist!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Buckenberry
reached in the car and grabbed Captain Toad&rsquo;s collar, shaking
him. &ldquo;What have you done?!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Captain
Toad grabbed his arm and twisted it painfully with little effort. &ldquo;I
was only saving your life since that fellow had a blade ready for
you. Now, get in.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Never,
you little freak- Ahhh! Frig, your breaking my- Let go!!&rdquo;
Buckenberry heard a distant siren and between the compromising
situation he was in and memories of skirting the law yesterday, he
made a decision he hoped was right. &ldquo;Okay, we&rsquo;ll leave
with you!!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Captain
Toad finally released his arm, with pain shooting through it like a
dagger. He almost wondered if getting stabbed by the Chuckster would
have been less painful.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">W-we
gotta ride with him??&rdquo; Lemmy asked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Buckenberry
could only moan in reply. They all got into the backseat and Captain
Toad drove off leisurely. His passengers speechless, Captain Toad
broke the silence.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-So
did you all succeed? Mrs. Toadette told me all about the mission. I
had just dropped off Mr. Toad at the castle and went back for a
stroll around town, my self. My, there so many baddies around, aren&rsquo;t
there?... Have you tuned in to WMUSH recently? They think someone has
a death ray and about a dozen are dead from internal injuries. One
Goomba engineer&rsquo;s liver fell out, would you know that? Another
Toad lady was bludgeoned then her right and central arteries burst. I
know that had to hurt. My favorite is the guy who&rsquo;s brain
liquefied and leaked out of his nose. But don&rsquo;t worry about
that, I baked cookies back at the castle for all of us, with
sprinkles!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Captain
Toad briefly glanced at his passengers in the rear view, the smile
never leaving his face. </font>

</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
Millennium Star in a blur approached Eldstar, seated on his yellow
crystalline throne. &ldquo;Ho ho, here I am. What was wrong again?&rdquo;
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Eldstar
put down the pager beside him. It was an old model from the 90s,
patched together with tape. &ldquo;A star warrior friend of mine
alerted me to a growing problem.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
was currently involved in a Mario Party, but for you old friend, I&rsquo;d
postpone it any time,&rdquo; the purple glowing star said.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Was
not your last Mario party decades ago?&rdquo; Klevar asked with his
back turned. He was researching online message boards concerning Toad
Town on a &lsquo;computer&rsquo;, two pieces of granite fused in the
middle with a screen on the top part and an input panel on the
bottom.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Splendid
observation. It was, but time is a loop ever cycling. What year is
this?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">2016?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Millennium
Star nodded. &ldquo;As the embodiment of one thousand years I was
there hosting then and I will continue to be for 984 more years. Does
this make sense?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Klevar and
Eldstar glanced at each other. &ldquo;..Sure, fellow. Make yourself
home in my temple. We must wait for &#9825;&#9834;!? anyhow as he has
the car.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Klevar
powered off the screen he was looking at. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll look
out for him, since I&rsquo;m done with this research. The verdict?

Skolar...&rdquo;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The double
doors of Dr. Toadley&rsquo;s lab pushed open. &ldquo;Dr. Toadley sir.
You might want to step outside for a moment.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The doctor
threw his keyboard down. &ldquo;Impossible! Can I accept being beaten
at my best game by a girl who is currently standing on her head? No I
cannot!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daisy
flipped the keyboard over, to find that some keys had fallen off.
&ldquo;Doc, give it a break. I&rsquo;ve only been playing Minesweeper
since I was a bored little girl.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She sat
with him in the south corner of the room at the newly &lsquo;restored&rsquo;
desk. Half of the table was broken off, the laptop&rsquo;s screen was
slightly shattered, and the whole thing being supported by stacks of
thick folders. The rest of the lab was still an unusable mess with
all of Toadley&rsquo;s testing equipment, patient beds, knickknacks,
and more tossed about randomly.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sir,&rdquo;
Mary pressed, &ldquo;this is really really important. I know you ran
those thugs off an hour ago, but they&rsquo;re back.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr.
Toadley pried himself away from the computer with a grunt. Mary
accompanied him outside where nearby businesses were either empty or
taken over and a giant Banzai Bill launcher was aimed right at the
doors.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mary
pointed to the cannon. &ldquo;S-see?!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A bony
beetle and dry bones wearing black vests and red bandannas came
around from the back. &ldquo;Give us your building or fall victim to
our super symmetry double attack!&rdquo; they said in unison. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr.
Toadley raised one eyebrow. &ldquo;Why is there one cannon and not
two?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
baddies looked at each other. &ldquo;Well&hellip;.because&hellip; we
couldn&rsquo;t afford two. But you probably can&rsquo;t afford
another face if you get too fresh with us, see?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Will
you give me one moment?&rdquo; They went back indoors to the lab.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Doctor,
these guys are-! Uh, sir, what are you doing?! Are we going to give
it up?&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadley
looked around for something. &ldquo;Are we? Yes, but not before I
give them a welcoming gift.&rdquo; He produced a remote from a drawer
and took the laptop off the desk.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Doc,
what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Daisy asked.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Should
you two wait for me outside? Yes you should.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mary and
Daisy complied hesitantly. They went outside where the thugs were
waiting.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What&rsquo;s
taking so long, girls?&rdquo; the bony beetle growled.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey,
be patient! Who do you think you are anyway?!&rdquo; Daisy spat. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The dry
bones produced a long knife. &ldquo;The &lsquo;Dry Bonez Thugz&rsquo;
and watch your mouth, princess. We would kidnap you if you were
wanted enough, but you ain&rsquo;t because you&rsquo;re not that
blonde princess.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Excuse
me??&rdquo; Daisy sprung towards the dry bones and kicked him in the
torso, knocking his frame fall apart and sending the blade to the
ground with a clang. Before the bony beetle could unsheathe his
spikes, she stomped him flat. Both &lsquo;thugz&rsquo; were piles of
bones scattered on the street and sidewalk. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah!
Take that!&rdquo; Daisy bent down on her knees, winded already.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wow,
that was amazing! Why aren&rsquo;t you in more games?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daisy
glanced at Mary and then looked away with some embarrassment. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
kind of a touchy subject.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Behind
them Birdley flew out of the clinic and perched on a power line
across the street. The girls stood under it and Mary called him down
a few times, but the white songbird didn&rsquo;t move. Daisy was just
offering to climb the pole to get him down when-</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">BOOM! The
Toadley Clinic blew up in a fiery explosion. The cannon was
destroyed, and Daisy and Mary were knocked off their feet as car
alarms went off and people nearby screamed in alarm. The dust was
just settling when Dr. Toadley safely emerged from a manhole on the
sidewalk and laughed maniacally.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Will
you try to take the clinic from me now?? Go ahead! Take what is left
of it, you hooligans!!&hellip;.&rdquo; Dr. Toadley and looked around.
</font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oopsy!
Squawk! Oopsy!&rdquo; Birdley chirped.</font></p>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
housing agent knocked Boo up (the old British meaning) that morning
to sign another late rent payment slip. Boo signed as a 'contract&rsquo;
that they promised to do better. Boo stayed up after that and did
nothing all morning. It really dawned on them how typical their life
was usually, off in a run down apartment in Forever Forrest with no
television or internet or even radio. It was a Saturday so they were
still off work from their job down the block called 'Stalk and
Shake'. Celebrities like Lady Bow or Tubba Blubba occasionally
visited the local diner but alas, this was still the weekend... </font>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo
floated outside the apartment for some natural sun light. </font>

other hobby is reviewing food online even though my only subscriber

sky.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Something
on the side of the apartment rustled.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Umm,
hello?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig Von
Koopa came around from the side. &quot;Ah, my apologies.&quot;</font></p>

gasped. &quot;W-what are you doing here?! Aren&rsquo;t you the one
who-&quot; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
revealed the zapper holster under his jacket. &quot;Calm down. Thank
you. Have you seen a boom shroom in this area?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Uh
uh&hellip; Yeah. It&rsquo;s in my cupboard.&quot; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Stop!&quot;
Luigi ran from where Ludwig did a moment ago. &ldquo;Oh hey. I didn&rsquo;t
know you lived here, &lsquo;Booigi the second&rsquo;. Did Ludwig
threaten you?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
glared at his companion. &ldquo;I was only inquiring of the locals.&rdquo;
He turned back to Boo. &ldquo;Hand it over. We need it to cure the
Mushroom Flu and do NOT get any funny ideas.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">O-oh,
okay...&rdquo; Boo had just found the mushroom the other day and was
going to review it online. The problem was they&rsquo;d already
sampled a bit&hellip; When Boo came back out of the apartment with
the half eaten fungus on a plate, they thought Ludwig might explode
with the way he tensed up at the sight.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
imbecile! What have you done?!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
quickly got in front of the koopaling. &ldquo;Relax. Most of it&rsquo;s
still there! Besides there&rsquo;s other things to worry about.
Mario&rsquo;s phone is subscribed to some news feeds and there&rsquo;s
officially a serial killer in the kingdom.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo and
Ludwig both had the look one might have if say, Peach agreed to marry
Bowser.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Uh,
yeah.&rdquo; Luigi read some info off of the phone. &ldquo;Almost a
dozen are dead by various means of internal damage.. All deceased had
connections to mass transport, and there are no suspects...&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Internal
damage?&rdquo; Ludwig seemed to contemplate something. &ldquo;That is
certainly unusual, but I guess that issue is out of our reach at the
moment. Come Luigi Mario, before some thug is tempted to take our
kart at the entrance.&rdquo; He picked up the plate and walked off.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So,
this is goodbye?&rdquo; Boo asked.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Guess
so buddy. If anything happens, remember to call Mario&rsquo;s number,
okay?&rdquo; Luigi sprint off as well and Boo watched their night in
green armor disappear in the woods.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Now Boo
really felt useless. They stared upwards, noticing for the first time
a black star hanging in the sky that seemed to follow you. Boo
entertained theirself by floating around as if playing a chasing game
with the celestial phenomenon. All was well until-</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">BAM! Boo
face planted smack into a tree. In a daze they fell out.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mr. Toad
Kinopio Toadstool downed another Carbamazepine with some water when
Toadette opened the door. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">(Hey,
homegirl..)&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
took a few steps in. &ldquo;Mr. Toad, I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re up,
but word is going around that the leader of the Chuckster faction was
assassinated and the entire group disbanded. That gives the West side
baddies complete control over Toad Town!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He found
Toadette adorable when worked up over nothing. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And
there&rsquo;s a serial killer on the loose!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Maybe she
was worked up over something..</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">(As
long as we stay indoors we&rsquo;ll be okay, babe.)&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Some color
returned to Toadette&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Heh, thanks for that
reality check. By the way, Dr. Toadley wants in here. His lab was
attacked or something. Is that okay?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">(Sure.)&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There was
the distant sound of something blowing up downstairs.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ugh!!
I thought I banned Iggy from using the microwave! I&rsquo;ll check on
you later.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">When she
left, Toad mustered some strength to get up. Hopefully he&rsquo;d
feel better once he walked around. Once he hit the halls he saw dust
everywhere, the doors to rooms being carelessly left open, and the
few staff that were working that day looking directionless. He
crossed one of the old timers, Russ T., who was sweeping fruitlessly
with stiff yellow broom that was only flicking the dirt around. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">(Hey,
Russ.)&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Greetings.
I&rsquo;ve been meaning to speak to you Mr. Toad. Do you know what is
special about this month?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">(Oh
yeah, Toadworth was born this month but I missed him before he left.
Toadette told me about the whole cure scavenger hunt thing.)&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
is true, but there is something else. Do you know of what has
happened many times on this date?&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
started to inch away, bored already. &ldquo;(I&rsquo;ll check back
with you&hellip;)&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So
ignorance will be your choice. I see,&rdquo; Russ said quietly as he
shook his head. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Downstairs
on the ground floor Toad passed the den with Roy, Wendy, and Larry
inside. Toad called to them but they only looked at him sourly and
didn&rsquo;t say one word. In the next room a smoke was in the air,
and Yoshi was standing around looking standoffish with his arms
crossed.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">(Yoshi!
High five, man!)&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi&rsquo;s
face softened as he returned the gesture. Toadette stumbled out of
the kitchen coughing with Iggy behind her, holding a silver steaming
tray. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wow,
what a yandere...&rdquo; Iggy said. &ldquo;I think my microwave meals
are the best, thank you very much!</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
fanned the air. &ldquo;(What&rsquo;s wrong with your brothers and
sister?)&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy held
the tray with one hand and scratched his green head with the other.
&ldquo;Ooooh that. Luddy-sama had them get Yoshi fruit but that&rsquo;s
all I can piece together, that and T. Yoshisaur somehow ended up with
them. They can&rsquo;t speak or even write and no one really knows
what happened to them.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Alagold
came from downstairs with a jittery disposition. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">(You
okay?)&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;m
cold, bro. So very cold...&rdquo; Alagold walked away shivering.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He&rsquo;s
suffering withdrawal,&rdquo; Iggy explained like it was no big deal.
&ldquo;A bad dream with a star or something scared him and he won&rsquo;t
touch his medications now. Oh, my shows are on!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With that
Toad was alone, so he decided to answer the door bell everyone else
was ignoring, and he got immediately trampled by Lemmy and Morton
rushing in.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">(Homeboys,
hold up!)&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
turned around. &ldquo;W-where&rsquo;s our brothers and sister??&rdquo;
</font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">(In
the other room, Lemmy but-)&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
is he saying???&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Morton
took slow steps back. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s talking nonsense, word salad,
gibberish!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ohmygod
he must be crazy too! Ruuuunnnn!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A hand
laid on his shoulder. &ldquo;Mr. Toad, are you okay? Let me assist.&rdquo;
</font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">(Thanks,
Stan,)&rdquo; Toad said as he was helped up by his look a like.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
Captain&rsquo;s hands lingered on Toad&rsquo;s shoulder and upper
arm, gripping tightly. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t hurt you did they??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">(Nope.
It&rsquo;s okay, homeboy.)&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Captain
Toad let go, with red cheeks just as Buckenberry rushed in right
afterwards, holding his arm like it was sore. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
telling on you, freak!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Please
do so, sir,&rdquo; Captain Toad challenged, with his voice perfectly
modulated to be considered non confrontational yet still laced with
deadly warning.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">When they
both promptly got lost, Toad found his energy tank to be on empty
already. Before he returned to bed, he remembered the note he had for
Toadsworth thanking him for his good service. Toad took the elevator
to the third floor where Toadsworth&rsquo;s private room was, quaint
with little possessions filling the living space other than
bookshelves and a reading table. On the well made up purple colored
bed was an old thick book with a felt book mark hanging out of the
middle.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
turned to the marked page. &lsquo;A stage act in play for millennium
past of actors a facsimile of their roles and those scorned..&rsquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Ah,
so not so ignorant after all,&rdquo; Russ said in the open doorway.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
started to tell him to buzz off, but it was his own fault for not
following the door closing rules. &ldquo;(Do you know about this,
Russ?)&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Are
you familiar with the Dark Star? Not the one that was defeated by the
Marios but an original dark star, the first &lsquo;Ztar&rsquo;?
Legend says when it arrives, it encompasses whomever it chooses.
Anyone can be a tool or instrument at any point&hellip;. Mr. Toad?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Russ
stepped closer but Toad had already passed out. &ldquo;Oh my!&rdquo;
Russ left the room to look for someone to call for help. He never
owned or operated those cell phone things so he was forced to search
manually. Incidentally he found someone quickly, standing right were
Toad&rsquo;s actual room was.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sir,
is something wrong?&rdquo; Captain Toad turned around, holding his
his hands a white sort of blanket that his face was buried in a
moment ago.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mr.
Toad has- Is that his blanket???&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Captain
Toad dropped it in a neat folded up state. &ldquo;Just doing laundry.
What&rsquo;s wrong with Mr. Toad??&rdquo; he asked with an edge in
his voice.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Russ
scanned Toad&rsquo;s room and found nothing else out of the ordinary
aside from the ill kept bed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s passed out back there.
Call someone.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Captain
Toad rushed to Toadsworth room, coming out right after. &ldquo;What
did you do?!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Nothing.
Who authorized you to go in there? You are not on our staff list.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
am an intern for today, sir, though this is the Mushroom Kingdom so
basically the same thing. I know the Princess doesn&rsquo;t pay any
of you.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Captain
Toad radioed Toadette while Russ was preoccupied with the thought
that he&rsquo;d have an opportunity to be a know it all.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">At The
Special World Hospital, Dr. Topper entered behind a green curtain
marked &lsquo;Case X&rsquo;. The portable white board marked &lsquo;Power
up tests&rsquo; was full of tally marks and Morris&rsquo;s
hyperactive assistant was already accepting his next assignment to
prep the radiation room. Judging by the scorched marks on the Ukiki
girl on the testing bed, and the fact that Dr. Toad was writing his
case study, he was too late.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Topper
sighed. &ldquo;May I dissociate myself from this research project?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad&rsquo;s
pencil led snapped. Less associates on the project meant he would be
farther from- No, Topper could not quit on him. &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;
</font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well,
I can&rsquo;t leave anyway just yet, I have to get something. Excuse
me.&rdquo; Dr. Topper patted his colorful coat pockets as he left.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Morris
turned to Dr. Toad when Johnson left the test area. &ldquo;Youths
these days, and old stuffy men too! They do like to either rush or
halt progress, don&rsquo;t you agree?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
yawned. &ldquo;Possibly.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Speaking
of difficult, my first job was as a medic for Sir Grodus back in the
day. I got fired when I accidentally sowed a few soldiers hands on
backwards. It&rsquo;s quite hard to tell when we never take off our
mittens.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
heard a light tap on the wall. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll meet you later. I
have something to do.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Morris
began to pack up. &ldquo;Do not worry my dear fellow, I will man the
hatches until you return!&hellip;&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
left the lab and hung his jacket on a rack. Once outside he saw the
vast featureless Star Road landscape with its powder blue ground and
dark starry sky, but there was no soul in sight. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hello?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What&rsquo;s
purple, black, blue, and red all over?&rdquo; Zoo Diddley became
visible. His face was swollen and puffy, there were cuts and bruises
all over him, and one of his eyes were red and running. &ldquo;Me!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo?!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
lost a battle with a pokey, a thwomp, and a&hellip; I&rsquo;m
kidding. Give me a hug.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
was hugged by his not so incorporeal after all brother. He brought
Zoo inside and gave him a surgical mask and a bonnet, typical nurse
ware. Zoo held a little backpack. &ldquo;Is there a place to store
stuff? I got a few things.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah,
we have lockers. What happened exactly with your old job that made
you have to hide here?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
dropped the smile. &ldquo;About that. While on the train I found a
today&rsquo;s paper. Bowser thinks I caused the Mushroom Flu.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
didn&rsquo;t, did you??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Of
course not,&rdquo; Zoo said seriously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit I had
a part, but only because they had me go to Toad Town and drop cans in
places. I still don&rsquo;t know why they hired me to help, and this
punk toad I met tried to do some funny tricks to pin it on me.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
sounds about right for you.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
does that mean??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You&rsquo;ve
always attracted trouble,&rdquo; Dr. Toad said smirking. &ldquo;Listen,
there&rsquo;s a reason we have some MF patients here. If we can find
out how exactly the virus affects the brain during coma walking, we
can reverse deterioration of cognitional abilities due to age or
illness.&rdquo; Dr. Toad noticed Zoo&rsquo;s blank look. &ldquo;Dad&rsquo;s
been sick-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; Zoo interrupt somewhat harshly. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
would if you saw him lately, or mom for that matter.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
shrugged it off. &ldquo;Enough nerd talk. Can I experiment now?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
grabbed a memo pad from a his pants pocket. &ldquo;First sign this.
Congratulations, you are an associate of the hospital as nurse &lsquo;Sue&rsquo;.
By the way, you just agreed that you will NOT experimenting on
anyone. Got you!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
laughed. &ldquo;Yep you got me, Drew. Heh. You&rsquo;ve never told me
how a schizo like you gets elected president.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Not
funny. I just studied and applied for the position like everyone
else. And I&rsquo;m bipolar. Get it right.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...One
last thing, about my blackouts&hellip;&rdquo; Zoo stared at the white
floor tiles, trying to think of how to explain it. &ldquo;Yeah, I
think&hellip; I might have hurt those people. Like, I&rsquo;d have a
weird headache every time I&rsquo;d wake up&hellip; And I&rsquo;m
hearing things. I think my bell, that I don&rsquo;t remember packing
in the first place, rung itself in my backpack.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
put his arm around him. &ldquo;There is a nose, elbow, foot, and
brain specialist who has an office here. He&rsquo;s kind of weird but
he&rsquo;s good in my opinion. I&rsquo;ll have him look at you.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thanks
Drew,&rdquo; Zoo smiled, revealing rows of sharp teeth. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
always had my back, bro. I&rsquo;m still hungry and I saw this
&lsquo;Applebys&rsquo; restaurant down the street-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Earn
a days wage and then we can talking about you borrowing yet again
from me...&rdquo;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><b>In Star
Haven...</b> </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey,
Great Eldstar.&rdquo; Geno bowed respectfully. &ldquo;I was trying to
tell you I might be late but my phone&rsquo;s screen is cracked so it
only works half of the time.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Eldstar
raised his eyebrows. &ldquo;That is fine. Now, could you explain your
concerns again?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sure,
pops. So, you know Dark Ztar, right? I think he&rsquo;s doing
something sneaky on Earth. I mean, what has Klevar over there found
out?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Klevar,
who hung in Eldstar&rsquo;s room as always turned around. &ldquo;Huh?
Oh, yeah.&rdquo; He switched a tab over from Fleabay. &ldquo;Let us
see here. Recent news: A &lsquo;dark star&rsquo; has appeared in the
sky and is intriguing everyone everywhere. Astronauts in Sky Land are
even planning a launch to investigate. Mushroom Flu breaks out in
Mushroom Kingdom. Also, they have the first serial killer in a few
decades. Here&rsquo;s some good news. Chancellor Toadsworth was born
today, the sweet old guy.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Geno
turned to Eldstar dramatically. &ldquo;See? And wasn&rsquo;t your
cousin born around this time? Maybe he wants attention. I read some
files on a particular Dark Boo on Earth and they saw a dark star in
their childhood, so maybe he want to repeat that on a larger scale.
As for the other bad things going on? I wouldn&rsquo;t put it past
him either!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Everyone
heard a toilet flush and Millennium Star entered the room. Geno
wondered why Eldstar was insisting he come along, but he didn&rsquo;t
have time to complain.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Klevar,
tell anyone asking I am visiting a &lsquo;friend&rsquo;,&rdquo;
Eldstar said. &ldquo;Thank you, dear one. Well &#9825;&#9834;!?, lead
the way!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Geno drove
Eldstar and Millennium Star to the dark realm in the blink of an eye.
No longer were the structures made of beautiful stone and crystals,
they were now jagged dull grey colors of an opaque material. &lsquo;ABANDON
ALL HOPE YE WHO ENTER HERE&rsquo; was on a sign right before a tall
thorn covered black gate, leading to the sanctuary of Dark Ztar.
Behind the gates was a onix colored spire coming from the purple
cracked ground. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Geno bang
on the gate. A moment later dark colored vortex appeared before
everyone and Dark Ztar emerged. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zach,
we must talk,&rdquo; Eldstar said.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jolly
good, we shall,&rdquo; Dark Ztar, a large ztar with white eyes, a
goatee, and monocle, replied. &ldquo;And I go by Dark Ztar now!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh,
my apologizes. Anyway, why didn&rsquo;t you tape that football game
you promised to?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Umm,
Eldstar?&rdquo; Geno whispered. &ldquo;I thought you were going to
ask about Earth?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
too! There is a little more chaos than normal and those on Earth are
seeing none other than your image in the skies above.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dark Ztar
stroked his goatee. &ldquo;Hmm. I&rsquo;ve only been doing my job
right up here. Why bother with that smelly terrestrial planet and
besides, how can you have the audacity to question me when you have
than old but very special pager?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Eldstar
started. &ldquo;What preposterous thing are you talking about?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
have appointments now. Be gone.&rdquo; Dark Ztar started to float
away.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; Geno growled. He shot a Geno Whirl at
Dark Ztar to stop him. Dark Ztar spun and shot a tidal wave dark
matter back. The golden glowing disc sliced through the wave to hit
the dark star, or its effigy rather. Dark Ztar and his dark matter
dissipate like it was all never really there at all. After being
struck by wonderment for a split second, everyone noticed a second
sign:</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">THIS ROOM
IS AN ILLUSION AND IS A TRAP DEVISUT BY DARK STAR.<br/>
GO AHEAD
DAUNTLESSLY! MAKE RAPID PROGRES!&quot; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Geno fell
to his star warrior equivalent to knees and shouted, &ldquo;Noooooooooo!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Eldstar
stood before everyone. &ldquo;Wait, I have an idea. If he want to

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Padded
seats, a light pink interior, and snacks on hand made Peach&rsquo;s
private jet comfortable on the way to the Chai Kingdom with
Chancellor Toadsworth, (who was no longer a &lsquo;chancellor&rsquo;
but the name stuck long after retirement) as their pilot. Apparently
his wish for turning a hearty 56 today was solely to air travel once
again as he had long ago over the beaches of Mushroomdy during the
great Bob-omb War. They had been in the air for a little while when
Mario played on his brother&rsquo;s phone. They owned the same model
and swapped by mistake that morning. Luigi had no social media or
games other than Sudoku, so that&rsquo;s exactly what Mario played
and failed badly at. After a while he got a message from &lsquo;Mario&rsquo;:
</font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No,
you didn&rsquo;t text yourself, this is Luigi. Toad and Daisy are
awake. Contact asap. Also I can&rsquo;t get rid of your bottom
signature thing. It&rsquo;s cheesy as heck, bro. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Mario,
let&rsquo;s-a go!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
chuckled when Bowser, seated behind him, slammed his pummeled looking
flip phone shut loudly. &ldquo;Grrr. Mario is my true rival, I don&rsquo;t
care that you have fury!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
quickly relocated to where Peach sat. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
yawned. &ldquo;Is everything fine?&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
texted me that Toad and Daisy are awake now.&rdquo; While speaking
Mario did a quick recount of his own belongings, including his super
scope. He couldn&rsquo;t remember what prompted him to even bring it
but it was there.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
smiled. &ldquo;Wonderful! We can explain this and we should be home
in a few hours.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
scoffed. &ldquo;Are you two sure they&rsquo;ll let us off easy?? Son,
show em that video. Discretion is advised!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Junior
pulled a modern large screen phone from his backpack. The video was
Sarasaland General S&#464;w&aacute;ng screaming (with the translation
in caption) that they would wage war against BOTH Dark Land and the
Mushroom Kingdom because the tennis match being canceled in such a
way disappointed millions of native Sarasaland people who only had
access to cable once a month. Highlights included footage of
Sarasaland missiles on standby, weapons on racks ready to use, and a
snippet of a public guillotine. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-That&rsquo;s
my favorite part! If we have a war, can I launch the first missiles?
Please please please?&rdquo; Junior begged, on his knees even.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...You
really need to get your son checked out.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Tell
me about it, plumber.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
leaned against the window and closed her eyes, her features tensing.
&ldquo;This is very unlike their generals but hopefully they will
calm down when we tell them their princess is okay.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">When the
aircraft dropped in altitude, Mario saw the village below with its
red tiled roofs, spidery little paths between buildings, and people
scurrying around like insects. Junior was a bug enthusiast so he had
the same thoughts and became glued to the windows as well. Mario also
saw a dark spot the size of a large coin in the daylight. He felt an
odd feeling deep inside when his two feet connected with the ground
and not just because of the bumpy landing. Everyone carried the few
things they packed and walked away from the plane.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thanks
for getting us here safe, Toadsworth.&rdquo; Mario noticed
deteriorated sate of the airstrip. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No,
thank you, Master Mario.&rdquo; Toadsworth said, suited up in a brown
bomber jacket with a matching old-school sheepskin pilot hat. &ldquo;I
still got it!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach head
to the port, a building two soldiers wearing turbans and holding
large machetes were guarding. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Princess,
wait!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
waved a hand. &ldquo;I need to handle registration matters and I
doubt you&rsquo;ll enjoy it. Why don&rsquo;t you head to town?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser&rsquo;s
giant hand appeared on Mario&rsquo;s shoulder and pulled him back.
&ldquo;-Sounds good, hotness. The plumber and I will do that with
your grandpa! Ha!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach&rsquo;s
smile became a flat line. &ldquo;Then we will meet you before the
government building later.&rdquo; And that was that.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
streets of Sarasaland emitted the feeling of a bustling but
developing kingdom. Ancient buildings whether occupied, empty, or
decaying neighbored brand new structures of a modern design. The
streets had little to no cars, but instead goombo workers and
citizens in droves, zipping to and fro on their business. A rocketon
occasionally darted through the sky in their planes, leaving a faint
wispy trail. A yurarin snatched the purse of a mother goombo with her
kids and Mario was powerless to intervene, especially since he was
somehow the one stuck holding Junior&rsquo;s hand!</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
is going to have to go through these same streets without us. We head
should back,&rdquo; he said, annoyed. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Too
late plumber, we&rsquo;ve been walking for ten minutes.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Can
we stop there? Please please please?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
turned where Junior was pointing to see a sword shop with all kinds
of huge sharp blades displayed in the window.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Absolutely
not!&rdquo; Mario snapped, while Bowser found it hilarious. Mario
transferred the vexing look to him. &ldquo;Why did you shack us up
together?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
avoided his gaze. &ldquo;Junior, come here.&rdquo; Junior went to his
dad, who picked him up and carried him on his shoulders. Mario and
Bowser were already taller than most of the natives, but this made
his son tower over everything. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you want a break?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">From
what? The princess? Toadsworth?&rdquo; Somewhat, Mario answered in
his mind. While in the company of both them AND Bowser, he did feel
like he had to put something of an act up. The Mushroom Kingdom&rsquo;s
greatest hero couldn&rsquo;t be seen as too friendly with the enemy.
&ldquo;Well, whatever. Want a drink?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Nah,
I don&rsquo;t think they sell soda here.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Maybe
they would have if- You know. Why did you do that to Fungus Up?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Because
I saw a war documentary as a kid about descaling koopas. It made me
cry,&rdquo; Bowser answered with out a hint of shame. They pass a
gift shop. &ldquo;Hold on.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser and
Junior went in for a moment and then came back out quickly, with
Bowser holding a black plastic bag. &ldquo;Okay, lead the way
mustache.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
observed the street signs again, rusty with the ways of the city. &ldquo;I
think we turn here. What did you find in there?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Your
mother.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
rolled his eyes and led the way again. &ldquo;Have you seen that
thing in the sky?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser and
his son craned their neck upwards. &ldquo;Huh, no.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Cooool!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Stop
staring at it!&rdquo; Bowser barked at Junior.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It was odd
how comfortable Mario felt with this. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Soon Peach
and Toadsworth met them, the latter now armed with thick travel
packets. Sarasaland was six hours ahead of their time so they had a
quick picnic dinner outside with sand dunes and the government
official pyramid in the backdrop. Under the evening sun&rsquo;s rays,
everyone consumed food brought from home, hoping the energy from it
would help them with the very delicate situation that they&rsquo;d be
facing. Insects desperate for free lunch made their way on the
blanket they sat on which Mario shooed away and the Bowsers added as
toppings for their meals.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">For
the last time I didn&rsquo;t kidnap your princess!! Huh? Well yeah I
did that one time, but&hellip; NO YOU!!&rdquo; Bowser slammed the
phone shut. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
slurped up some lukewarm spaghetti. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s with that?&rdquo;
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
glanced down at Mario&rsquo;s Italian dish for a moment. &ldquo;Nothing
really. Idiots just think they can harass me because I ain&rsquo;t in
my kingdom at the moment. But anyway, that reminds me..&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He slapped
two greeting cards down in front of Mario and Peach. Mario&rsquo;s
had on the cover &lsquo;Will you be my...&rsquo; Mario opened it up.
&lsquo;Favorite hoe?&rsquo; There was also a picture of the diamond
farming tool. Apparently this was a Minecraft card.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
opened hers. &lsquo;Baby you make my palms sweaty, knees weak, arms
spaghetti.&rsquo; &ldquo;Whatever does this mean?&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
idly scratched an itch. &ldquo;Oops. I swapped the ones I meant to
give y&rsquo;all.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well
I&rsquo;ll treasure it always&hellip; I think.&rdquo; Mario stuck the
card in his pocket.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thanks,
plumber. And you really are my favorite &lsquo;hoe&rsquo;, I guess.
Ha!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
am glad we are getting along,&rdquo; Peach said. &ldquo;If anything
goes wrong, at least we&rsquo;ll have our &lsquo;interesting&rsquo;
dynamic.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
say!&rdquo; Toadsworth agreed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario saw
that Luigi&rsquo;s phone had service again. He replied to Luigi and
hoped he&rsquo;d understood the lateness. He looked something up on
the web browser. &ldquo;Hmm. Sky Land launched a shuttle to that
thing in the sky earlier.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
chuckled dryly. &ldquo;They should have launched a shuttle here.
Yeah, launch me back home and in my bed.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach got
up when everyone was done eating. &ldquo;May the stars be with us...&rdquo;</font></p>

<p><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">RE:
Zoo Sue Diddley. </font></em>
</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">This
is Dr. Kuribo to Boo Master of the Do-Gooder Boo Community. You will
find Zoo to be a bright if mischievous little boo. Since the event he
blames on ringing a &lsquo;bell&rsquo; he had schizoid tendencies
such as black outs during which he is violent in a way I cannot
elaborate unfortunately, as I only have second hand accounts to go
by. He is currently on medication and I will send a full report next
week when he is transferred. Thank you.&rdquo; </font></em>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie put
the files Geno acquired down. The lights were out in the entire
Mushroom Press building and the windows and doors were boarded up
with the gang activity happening. What exactly was she dealing with?
She knew Zoo was special in some way, but what was this sudden
mention of bells? It was time to direct her investigation to what
kind of object could possibly-</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">SEEK
AND DESTROY ZOO FOR HARMING YOUR BELOVED.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
switched the browser tab to another line of investigating. &lsquo;Susie
Que&rsquo; was hired just yesterday, so Kylie had Jesse at the front
desk trying to dig for his/her application. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Emery
wheel her way over in on a roller chair. &ldquo;Hey, Kylie.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I&rsquo;m
focusing,&rdquo; she said curtly. &ldquo;I mean, excuse the attitude,
I forgot you were here. You holding up okay? I never intended to have
you stranded here with me.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No,
it&rsquo;s fine. Like, what else would I be doing? I have no life.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jesse
rounded the corner gave her the application, leaving the building
right after, though Kylie was too preoccupied to notice while doing a
reverse number search on Susie&rsquo;s reference number. It
purportedly belonged to a &lsquo;Drew Louis Diddley&rsquo;, listed as
a prestigious scientist with several awards at his young age.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">At Kylie&rsquo;s
request, Emery dialed the number with her quick little hands.
&ldquo;Hello...Oh, wow...Okay bye, gosh!&rdquo; She hung up,
frowning. &ldquo;Yep, I&rsquo;ve met him before. He&rsquo;s Dr. Toad
and he freaks out when people call him randomly.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr.
Toad is Drew Diddley?! Come on! If that&rsquo;s our only clue about
Zoo we gotta head there, for Mitch..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
pried away a few boards so that they could leave, being taken back at
what she saw outside. The sky was had a red tinge even though it was
only mid day. The moon, or what Kylie thought was the moon was
looking awfully dark as well, hanging in the sky like a literal black
hole. Some buildings were on fire and wrecked cars and property was
strolled about. A few yards away a group of cheep cheeps on
motorbikes circled three scared Toads and promised to make them fish
food if they didn't leave the city. A dry bones and a bony beetle
chased a koopa all the way down the train track. The defunct train
had been covered over with a banner with both an anarchy and a star
symbol on it. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Emery
waved to a group across the street. The trio, a human, a bob-omb, and
a boss bass turned around. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Emery?
We've been looking for you!&rdquo; Daffodil said. She ran across the
street with the others. Kylie shifted uncomfortably at the unlikely
friends of her friend.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Did
ya know? We&rsquo;re running this joint, love,&rdquo; Chomper said. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You're
the leaders?&rdquo; Emery asked.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Aye,
we befriended two gangs, the &lsquo;Seaworthy Switch Blades&rsquo;
and the &lsquo;Dry Bonez Thugz&rsquo; and with them ran any other
baddies out! Lil&rsquo; Nukem over &lsquo;ere is the reason why some
of &lsquo;em have these big &lsquo;ol cannons and whatnot!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah,
piece of cake!&rdquo; Nukem said in his cool voice.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That's
ridiculous!&rdquo; Kylie exclaimed. &ldquo;So you losers just go
around beating everyone up?&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
don't hurt anyone if they leave town,&rdquo; Nukem was quick to
correct. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So
much better!&rdquo; Kylie said icily. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s scram.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What&rsquo;s
your problem, you unfun little punk?&rdquo; Daffodil spat, whipping
her hair back and getting in Kylie&rsquo;s face. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Emery got
between them and held out her arms. &ldquo;Stop! I&rsquo;m sure
there&rsquo;s an explanation.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie&rsquo;s
fist clenched. &ldquo;Yeah, this one. Your friends are crap! CRAP!!&rdquo;
she screamed, her voice breaking. Kylie stormed off from Emery and
the baddies.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dang&hellip;
We would have explained out cause.&rdquo; Daffodil filed her nails
idly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Emery
shrugged. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fret. She&rsquo;ll be okay I mean.. Like
I was the one with the car, but whatever. So, what were you guys up
to again?&rdquo;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie had
never before felt such an insufferable mix of anger and betrayal as
she walked and walked and walked. It was like a dream, except she
found herself in the spot where the paved Toad Town road ended and
the orange dirt road began for real. A group of cowboys were lining
the gate leading to the foot of Mt. Rugged. Off to the side was a
fresh looking wooden sign post saying &lsquo;all Toad Town residents
welcome!&rsquo;. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Once
through the wooden fencing, the area was alive. Around the hospital
were people&rsquo;s tents stationed and makeshift shops, even Rowf
and Rhuff selling badges. Inside the hospital was quieter. She tried
to sit down, order some tea, and wind down when-</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">CHECK..
ON.. HIM.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
looked around and saw no one addressing her, but felt the urge to
head towards Mitch&rsquo;s room, finding it empty. She rushed back to
the desk.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
happened to Mitch?!&rdquo; she asked hysterically.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Rou T.
went from the computer to her, face full of sadness. &ldquo;Sorry
hun. His family stopped by and handled the rest. I think they
pronounced him brain dead.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mitch. The
guy Kylie met in high-school. The one she spent weekends in arcades
with. Her partner as a journalist. The most interesting Toad she&rsquo;d
ever met. Her ex-boyfriend. He was gone&hellip; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie&rsquo;s
nose was still runny and eyes damp when she received the third tea
and slowly took a sip.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mon
ami! What is wrong?&rdquo; Jelectro Bond took a seat across from her.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Her
ceramic cup make a clink on the table. &ldquo;On this day everyone
will know that they cannot take from me and not expect consequences.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He slid
down his glasses to study her expression. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Never
mind that, Bond. I&rsquo;m handling it,&rdquo; she said bluntly.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie,
I was going to tell you that the description of the railway killer
fits Zoo.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Great,
because I&rsquo;m hunting Zoo down and no force will stop me. I&rsquo;ll
even pay for help-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Pay?!&rdquo;
Sebastian run up to Kylie. &ldquo;Guys, over here!!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The rest
of his squad seemingly materialized out of nowhere to crowd their
table.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
could use a job,&rdquo; their leader James said, limping on one foot,
&ldquo;And a break from the walloping going on here! We ain&rsquo;t
getting paid enough for dat!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
want us to storm a place?&rdquo; Richard asked, smiling despite the
bandages scattered over his face. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re kind of good at
that.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wiggletron
cracked one set of his fingers, namely because his other set of arms
were in a sling. &ldquo;Then let us not let time elapse needlessly.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sebastian
turned back to Kylie. His head was wrapped like he&rsquo;s sustained
a head injury. &ldquo;Cool, always a fan! &lt;3&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Am
I the only person who thinks this is the dumbest dern ideal ever?&rdquo;
Parabilly was somehow without a scratch.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Loosen
up, Billy. Do something crazy! Well, aside from jumping on stage and
telling us what else happened with your sister and law.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Parabilly
shoved Richard, who had to resist saying &lsquo;Ouch&rsquo; loudly.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
peeps are hired then. We&rsquo;ll go to the &lsquo;Special World
Hospital&rsquo; to possibly get the jump on a guy named Zoo,&rdquo;
Kylie said.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond stood
up from the seat. &ldquo;Just try to not get yourself hurt.&rdquo; He
stopped right before the entrance. &ldquo;Oh, and thank you for the
tip of Zoo&rsquo;s whereabouts.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie&rsquo;s
eyes narrowed as he walked through the hospital&rsquo;s hastily
repaired doors.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
leaned back against the sandstone wall of the ancient pyramid that
was also neatly also a government official building. From the hallway
he could hear the low rumble of all of the constantly stirring
quicksand outside. Sandwiched he was between Junior occupied
completely with his ant farm, and Toadsworth reading. The three were
shunned from joining Peach and Bowser behind the door ahead so they
all waited begrudgingly until that gradually abated to just boredom.
Mario noticed the vibrant travel pamphlet in the hands of the ex toad
chancellor next to him. &lsquo;Take a cruise at Isle Delfino.&rsquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Yes,
Master Mario?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
realized he&rsquo;d been leaning in while imagining himself on a
beach. &ldquo;Oh nothing. I wish I was there right now.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadsworth
folded the pamphlet up. &ldquo;I concur. Maybe we can fly there again
someday.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario was
half asleep when the door was slammed open so hard it almost flew off
the hinges. Bowser stomp out groggily.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
drugged me with something and then TOOK THE PRINCESS!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
sprung into the room that contained nothing but file cabinets and a
single wooden desk. A door was directly opposite from the one he
entered and wide open with guards heading their way. Mario kicked it
shut. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser?!
How did this happen?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
diplomat freak offered me a complementary tasty tonic then next thing
I know, I wake up and Peach is gone! Who does he think he is??! ME??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The door
knob jiggled. &ldquo;Blast. We need to go!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
dear! Is everything alright?&rdquo; Toadsworth said from the hallway.
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Junior
barged in. &ldquo;What did I miss? What did I miss??&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
ushered everyone out back into the hall they started in and locked
that door too. &ldquo;We have to find the Princess! Were there ANY
clues?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah,
the topic was &lsquo;relocation&rsquo; to a castle or something. Got
any ideas, Mr. World Traveler?&rdquo; Bowser asked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
nodded. &ldquo;Daisy&rsquo;s Castle! Unless things have changed,
that&rsquo;s the only castle in the land.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">When they
ran to the exit, nine guards were blocking the passageway out. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
got this plumber, get over here...&rdquo; Bowser picked up Mario.
Mathematical formulas appeared before him as he calculated the shot.
He might have missed at the Mario Kart race two days ago, but he
wouldn&rsquo;t this time. He tossed Mario like a speeding bullet
right at the guards, making all of them topple over like bowling
pins. Bowser scooped Mario up in passing and they made it outside of
the pyramid and back into the Chai Kingdom.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Where&rsquo;s
that flower chick&rsquo;s castle?&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario spit
out part of a tooth. &ldquo;Walking would take too long. We&rsquo;ll
need a ride.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">As the
world was bobbing up and down in time with Bowser&rsquo;s massive
sprint like steps, Mario noticed Junior and even the usually slow
Toadsworth keeping up excellently as they zipped out into the streets
and down an alley, entering into a closed shop to loose any guards
following their trail. Among some carpentry, Mario was dropped down
roughly into a short wooden chair.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oww!&rdquo;
</font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Next
time I&rsquo;ll drop ya on the floor then.&rdquo; Bowser went back
outside. He really was on a roll when the princess was involved,
Mario pondered.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadsworth
peered into Mario&rsquo;s eyes with his beady own, shedding his
previous look of fear for something Mario couldn&rsquo;t describe.
&ldquo;Master Mario, what is Bowser to you?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
rubbed his cheek where the tooth ache, not in the mood for that in
the slightest. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s complicated.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Not
at all. Let us see here: Bowser let a rogue nearly cause a bio-terror
scare and you are okay with that.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario gave
him a look like he&rsquo;d grown another head. &ldquo;Says who?!?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Tut-tut!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
are being ridiculous, no offense. I can&rsquo;t stop every bad thing,
okay? I&rsquo;m one person and I&rsquo;m not freaking perfect!&rdquo;
Mario raised his voice, wanting so badly to tell off the old man who
really was more of a liability these days anyway. After all, he did
no real work around the castle aside from worrying about Peach
needlessly and enforcing so many arbitrary rules even though this was
the twenty first century and-</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
shook those bitter thoughts out of his head while Toadsworth
continued to look uncharacteristically smug.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Indeed
you are one person. Smart move old chap, electing your brother to do
all of your work back home today.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oooooh!&rdquo;
Junior covered his mouth, lapping up the unfolding drama.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Don&rsquo;t
go there, Junior,&rdquo; Mario warned. He spun around when he heard
Bowser stomping near. &ldquo;Did you find a bike or something?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Better.
Get out there.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Outside
was an army motor dolly, but he shuddered when he caught sight of its
original owner unconscious and curled up in the shadows to the side
of the building they were hiding in.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">LET
IT GO MR. GOODGUY,&rdquo; a voice seemingly inside himself said.
Mario could not eschew the suggestion.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Okay
let&rsquo;s hit it, but I&rsquo;m driving.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario got
into the drivers spot and Bowser got beside him. Junior hopped in the
back, and Toadsworth got in last. The engine came to life as smoothly
as an old decrepit lawn mower, cruising them out the alley and onto
the condensed crowds. They left down town and drove over one last
sand dune to find a bronze colored sphinx to the left and an Eastern
styled temple to the far right. Daisy&rsquo;s Castle was in the
middle, positioned right under the evening sun. It was two stories
tall, reflecting Daisy&rsquo;s down to Earth nature and it had age on
Peach&rsquo;s castle by at least a century or more. Leading to the
castle was a sandstone path with daises lining it on each side and
five guards armed with spears. Five guards that were starting to
become very alarmed at the vehicle racing towards them!</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ease
on the gas there, plumber!&rdquo; Bowser said. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Junior
screamed, &ldquo;Weeeeeee!&rdquo; with his arms up. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dear
me!&rdquo; Toadsworth covered his eyes.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">HIT
THEM,&rdquo; the voice said again. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Next Mario
knew, the guards were jumping out of the way as their car shot down
the sandstone path. Mario stomp the brakes and they skid all the way
into the nine foot tall bamboo doors, breaking the lock and knocking
them slightly open.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Master
Mario??? What was that?&rdquo; Toadsworth questioned.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Awesome,&rdquo;
Junior said, giddy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
shrugged. &ldquo;Not really your style fatso, but it got the job
done.&rdquo; He jumped out the kart and slammed the doors fully open.
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They first
hugged the wall to the right, sending alarmed servants and unarmed
guards packing as they snuck around. It was like Tom Clancy&hellip;
Except Mario had the super scope, aiming it at every moving thing and
not stopping short at the person that descended the stairs that lead
to the second floor where the throne room was. The general raised his
arms high, muttering in another language.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Where&rsquo;s
Peach?!&rdquo; Mario shout.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
gestured upstairs. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">DO
NOT TRUST HIM. TAKE HIM OUT.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser,
stop screaming at me,&rdquo; Mario said with gritted teeth that ache,
souring his mood farther.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
haven&rsquo;t said nothin&rsquo; moustache,&rdquo; Bowser replied,
confused. &ldquo;Hey, you! Take us there already!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
general went back up the steps slowly, Mario&rsquo;s gun pressed to
his back, heading towards Daisy&rsquo;s throne room, a frilly and old
fashioned looking thing with walls lined in gold, a glass chandelier
above, and a red ornate carpet leading up to the throne with Princess
Peach beside it.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario!&rdquo;
the pale faced Princess cried.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He froze
with weapon in hand. Guards were in the room also armed with spears
raised to attack but no one got near. The general they&rsquo;d
confronted went straight to a young person, arguing with him in
native tongue that didn&rsquo;t sound very good.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Y-you
are welcome to attend the upcoming wedding of Princess Peach and
Great Honorable General S&#464;w&aacute;ng XIX of Sarasaland&rsquo;s
National Force,&rdquo; the shaky Bullet Biff in a business suit said.
&ldquo;Or, you w-were...&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
general, apparently General S&#464;w&aacute;ng went off again on a
rant they couldn&rsquo;t understand. There were apparently multiple
General &lsquo;S&#464;w&aacute;ngs&rsquo;, it being part of a title
rather than a proper name. The skinny looking fellow before them was
definitely not the one who sent death threats over video message to
Bowser. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario,
whatever are you doing?&rdquo; Peach frowned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all a
misunderstanding. Put that down!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">But Mario
found he couldn&rsquo;t drop it. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
continued anyway, holding back tears. &ldquo;Once Bowser fell asleep
during that meeting, they told me they would launch the missiles
towards the Mushroom Kingdom if I did not marry the general. I told
them that Daisy was unharmed but no one cares!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A low
growl emitted from Bowser&rsquo;s throat as his eyes wandered to the
super scope. Mario caught the look, his intentions, and everything.
Toadsworth and even Junior were silent closest to the door, both
anxiously anticipating what might happen next (for differing reasons)
but also determined to only observe.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">FIRE
IT.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario&rsquo;s
finger threatened to squeeze the trigger. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">FIRE
IT!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He aimed
at the General. The air all around was thin.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Don&rsquo;t
do it!&rdquo; Peach cried.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
wanted to reply, but the words never came out. Something was wrong,
very wrong, but what could he do now? Was it really his hand holding
the trigger at this point?</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...Please
please please! I wanna fire it!&rdquo; Bowser Junior blurt out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
picked up his excitable son. &ldquo;That is very dangerous. Shut up!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">But
I want to shoot stuff! We&rsquo;re the bad guys, that&rsquo;s what we
do!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The bad
guys&hellip; Mario dropped the weapon to the ground as the fog
cleared. Consequently he found his voice.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Princess,
you&rsquo;ve always known what was best for the kingdom before. I&rsquo;m
very sorry and I wasn&rsquo;t thinking straight. Umm, blame jet lag.
So I&rsquo;m Mario if you don&rsquo;t know. This is Bowser,
Toadsworth, and Junior. We only came here to let you know that your
princess is awake now and the whole thing started by a mistake, so
please don&rsquo;t take this out on the rest of our kingdom.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
translator relayed that tangent and the General and his guards seemed
more confused than angry.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Umm,
let me introduce the Princess properly too, if you&rsquo; d let me
approach her. It&rsquo;s a custom where we&rsquo;re from.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
translator said that. The General didn&rsquo;t take his eyes off
Mario when he spoke back.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
says that he is not stupid,&rdquo; the translator with wobbly legs
relayed.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
so&hellip; can she come to us?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
General nodded, finding that a much better idea&hellip; for some
reason. The blonde princess became free to slowly join Mario&rsquo;s
side.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So,
this is Peach and why don&rsquo;t you get to know her? She&rsquo;s a
treasure, she really is.&rdquo; Peach flushed when he said that.
Bowser seemed sort of jealous, but knowingly Mario&rsquo;s entire
group shared a &lsquo;glance&rsquo;. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">In
addition to running a Kingdom that&rsquo;s gone hundreds of years
strong without even an official army,&rdquo; Mario continued, &ldquo;she
plays sports, throws parties, and has a good time. Notice her shoes.
She has another neat talent.&rdquo; Mario, with Peach in his embrace,
had his back against the door. &ldquo;...She&rsquo;s a good sprinter
in them. EVERYONE GTFO.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach ran
out of the doors with Mario, Bowser, Toadsworth, and Junior
frantically tumbling down the steps as well. Clumsiness paid off when
they collided with guards at the bottom of the steps. Mingling around
on the bottom floor were now a lot of normal looking towns people and
a banner hung up said in Chinese &lsquo;Civilian Group Meeting&rsquo;
(though they didn&rsquo;t know that). Mario and co. tried to blend in
with the crowd who were conveniently heading down halls leading out.
They almost made it when they pass by a very innocent looking servant
girl, shyly standing near some fine pottery and dusting it off while
trying to avoid the gaze of too many people. Peach took kindly to her
and smiled warmly. Suddenly the servant pointed to them all and
screamed with an unusual alarm sound. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
covered his ears. &ldquo;SHUDDUP!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
glanced behind them. &ldquo;Oh no! They&rsquo;re catching up!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They got a
shock when rushing outside. The sky was becoming darker and darker
with a burgundy hue. Monks were running from the temple and
archaeologists from the sphinx. It was like the entire country got
put on alert at once.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Everyone
crammed in the cart to speed back up and over the sand dune to get
into the city again. It was dark without street lights and they
almost collided with panicking natives immediately. Mario strained
his eyes to see.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Guys,
I&rsquo;m lost!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Grr.
I blame that stupid moon.&rdquo; Bowser pointed above to the eclipse.
On closer inspection the &lsquo;moon&rsquo; was oval and no extra
light could escape from behind it.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Master
Mario, I want to apologize. I said some things I should not have and
I do not know what came over me,&rdquo; Toadsworth said all of a
sudden.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario was
only partially paying attention. &ldquo;Sure. I think we&rsquo;ve all
screwed up today.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
were we thinking trying to negotiate without Daisy physically with
us?&rdquo; Peach hugged herself tightly, overwhelmed. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Son,
fire up that gps thing,&rdquo; Bowser said.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
Junior&rsquo;s phone was almost the only source of light around when
he cut it on. &ldquo;Done, dad.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~Make a
left turn in one-hundred feet. You will reach your destination in
five minutes~ </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It was a
good thing Mario was a taxi driver very briefly back in Brooklyn.
(How else would he get the inspiration for the deadly Mario Kart?) He
could memorize that distance anywhere, even in the dark. What
couldn&rsquo;t be memorized however were random cars and passengers
blind without technology assistance who almost crashed with them
every minute. Mario swerved to avoid a goombo on a bike. He almost
crashed into another motor dolly. A sign post knocked off the left
side mirror. Okay, so maybe that last obstacle was a stationary one.
Either way, it was time for that left turn which would put them on
the airstrip. The already vibration prone dolly became an earthquake
simulation when they started to hit the pot holes.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
think that is it over there, Master Mario!&rdquo; Toadsworth said.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
stopped the kart just as it became dark enough to only see the white
strip that was on their private jet. Bowser felt around until he
found a door. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sorry
hotness. I&rsquo;m gonna have to do this.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Do
what, Bowser?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They then
heard someone&rsquo;s nails scraping against the plane&rsquo;s
aluminum panels. Mario and the rest protest.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What??
I&rsquo;m only scratching deep enough to find the door seam. Bleh.
Our airships down home don&rsquo;t have this problem. Well, we don't
really use doors either but still..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
became illuminated by a warm glow. Approaching the five were soldiers
holding flaming torches with a different general tagging along. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Attention
foreigners, you will not be leaving!&rdquo; one soldier said, holding
a loaded weapon. This general, a bearded bombshell koopa with his
features contorted into a deathly looking scowl, was recognized as
the guy sending those threatening video messages. A breeze also
started to pick up.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Do
not get silly ideas, or we will blow your plane apart right now.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
general said something that didn&rsquo;t sound good and shoved the
soldier aside. He grabbed Peach&rsquo;s left arm and tried to pull
her his way.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario and
Bowser found themselves jumping out at the same time but froze in
place as a low drone unlike anything they&rsquo;d ever heard. While
not visible against a black sky, a swirling dark cloud settled and
became a black hole. Dust and sand from the landing strip began to be
sucked upwards like there was a giant vacuum above the area. It
increased in strength and they felt the pull themselves. The soldiers
had long ran away and abandoned their general. Even where they were,
they could hear the cries from those in the city.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario&rsquo;s
hand closed around Peach&rsquo;s right one, but the general still
held the other side, star struck and staring upwards with his mouth
wide open. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">General,
let go!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
general began to be lifted upwards taking Peach with him.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario?!&rdquo;
Peach began to scream and Mario also, eternally at least. His hat and
her crown were taken from their heads. Mario held on for dear life
when he felt large hands surround his waist area. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Son,
get this loser off of Peach!! Old man, start that jet!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Junior
shivered as Toadsworth scurried inside the jet. The sound of the
engines spinning up right next to them was silent compared to the
vortex.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;ll
let you fire missiles when we get home!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Junior
climbed onto everyone&rsquo;s backs to reach the general. &ldquo;Now
what?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Do
something!&rdquo; Bowser&rsquo;s feet began to lift from the ground.
&ldquo;Right now!!! Do it!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Junior
grabbed the first thing from his backpack and smashed it over the
general&rsquo;s head. As his ant trooper farm shattered, insects and
shards of glass went everywhere, disorienting General S&#464;w&aacute;ng
and making him lose the grip on Peach. Mario, Peach, Bowser, and
Junior came crashing to the ground while he disappeared in the sky.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A moment
later Mario could tell they were in the jet and he could hear Peach
and Bowser arguing loudly, as he lay in a chair exhausted. </font>

Letter: This is to my buddy Whacka on Mt. Rugged. Wasn&rsquo;t that
math homework terrible last week? I got an extension because our
teacher knows I work so much but I&rsquo;m still struggling! I might
need you to tutor me. I don&rsquo;t mean that in a funny way though.
XD Me and the others are having to run off thugs a lot but it&rsquo;s
pretty fun. Did you hear about that Sky Land shuttle? It's creepy,
the shuttle was sucked up and they couldn&rsquo;t contact it anymore.
We&rsquo;re all stipulating that it&rsquo;s a wormhole but that still
don&rsquo;t seem right and the news ain&rsquo;t covering it no more.
These are freaky days, ain&rsquo;t it? Worse still, forecast calls
for storms later and our power reserves can be shoddy. Stay strong
and remember how often we flood.</font></em>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
muttered to herself as she trudged to answer the doorbell. &ldquo;-Dr.
Toadley, if you're going to go outside and search for mines when I
told you we don&rsquo;t have them, don&rsquo;t lock yourself-&rdquo;
She opened the door. &ldquo;Out?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
would rather be &lsquo;in&rsquo;, Ms. Toadette.&rdquo; Ludwig brushed
past her.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey
Toadette. What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Luigi asked, coming in behind
the koopaling.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Everything
is fine fine fine,&quot; she answered though gritted teeth. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Alright
then,&quot; Luigi replied skeptically. Besides that, Mario had
replied that Luigi was doing a great job as the temporary leader and
that was great, even if the text took some hours to get through
overseas.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mr.
Luigi?&rdquo; Captain Toad came out of a room holding a plate full of
blackened cookies. &ldquo;Would you care for some? They are crispy
but..well...&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi!
Don&rsquo;t take anything from him. He hit someone with a Mr.
Toadworth&rsquo;s car,&rdquo; Buckenberry jumped out from behind a
houseplant like he&rsquo;d been there for a while waiting. Also, he
inexplicably had a black eye.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Let
the sir settle down, will you?&rdquo; Captain Toad said with a
dangerous twinkle in his eye.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;ll
pass, but thanks.&rdquo; Right then, Daisy cartwheeled into Luigi,
knocking him down.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey
Weegee!&rdquo; she said over his body. Her skin was green and she&rsquo;d
grown six feet tall.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Give
him some room, babe,&rdquo; Toad said in perfect English. He smiled
and was wearing some spare clothes while also covered head to toe in
red spots like on his cap with a third arm sprouting from under his
left one.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
screamed, causing another person to rush him.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
is wrong?!&rdquo; Ludwig then saw Toad and Daisy. &ldquo;Ahhhhh!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
got used to them an hour ago...&rdquo; Iggy said with a shrug. He
came from where Ludwig came from, only he was suited up in a white
coat with yellow thick gloves like a mad scientist. &ldquo;But not
him.&rdquo; Iggy pointed out Russ T. who was currently on a tall
ladder painting black stars on the roof. &ldquo;Creepy right?&hellip;
EVERYONE DUCK!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy and
everyone else dove to the ground as a helicopter drone with razor
blades zipped in the air above everyone&rsquo;s heads in an erratic
pattern.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What&rsquo;s
the point of that terrifying thing?!&rdquo; Luigi asked.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It
helps you exercise. If you don&rsquo;t move you die. Neat right? Do
you all feel exercised yet?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy,
turn that thing off. We need to get back to work!&rdquo; Ludwig
growled. &ldquo;Junior just sent me some horrid emoji ridden text
message that they are on their way back.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
is almost back?! Great but why are people mutating anyway?&rdquo;
Toadette asked. &ldquo;You never explained that.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
thought for a moment while the drone continued to whirl dangerously
above, somehow never managing to hit either them or Russ T. &ldquo;Junior
probably cross contaminated our Mushroom Flu virus sample by
spreading it on toast once or twice, they should live however... Do
not give me that look, everyone. In the mean time, Toad and Daisy
would be great at tennis.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
flipped on his back, turning to Daisy. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s right you
know.&rdquo; He stared at the ceiling above, observing the well
detailed black stars that were now obscuring the original blue paint
job. &ldquo;Yeah, definitely not a fan of the redecoration.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Channel 64
reporter Lakitu turned the microphone back to himself as the cameras
rolled.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Thanks
for the time. You&rsquo;re one of the last undisturbed businesses in
Toad Town.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
Postmaster smiled, hardly detectable under his grey mustache. &quot;Just
doing my job. After all, thugs, freaks, and baddies still need to
send their letters. Just look over there.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The camera
panned to a bemused Dry Bowser retrieving a package from his PO
box.<br/>
&ldquo;I am not a thug, freak, or baddie. I am not even
sure why I am here, save for a thinly veiled author shout out to
another author they like. Oh well, off to Waluigi&rsquo;s Taco
Stand...&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The camera
panned back. &ldquo;Anyway, that was Channel 64,&rdquo; he said into
his camera. &ldquo;CUT!&rdquo; Lakitu put on a spartan style warrior
helmet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to roll before a baddie steals my car
again. Over and out!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">When
Lakitu opened the door, his face was pelted with a large water
balloon. His car drove off with the occupants laughing.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Woohoo!
No more expired tags for me!&rdquo; a teenage orange spotted toad
girl said with her passengers being a human, a boss bass, and a
bob-omb. All but one of the nearby boo buddies hanging around also
cackled. The Postmaster ran out and shook his fists at the hooligans
but it was too late.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
hate my life..&rdquo; Lakitu&rsquo;s saggy cloud took him down the
sidewalk. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Just then
a bandaged and bruised Parakarry landed roughly near Postmaster, with
half of his lost feathers floating down from the sky a second later. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Take
it easy. It&rsquo;s about closing time,&rdquo; Postmaster told him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Parakarry
leaned against the door frame, rubbing his scraped knee. &ldquo;I
know, but there&rsquo;s this huge influx of letters from Mt. Rugged
to Toad Town. Since it&rsquo;s probably concerned family checking up,
I can&rsquo;t stop now.&rdquo; He breathed out deeply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
head across the street to Club GameCube for a drink. Club 64 got
unsafe hours ago.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">When the
winged mail carrier went across the street, he had to pass the boos
hanging around. He felt leery walking past the group consisting of a
Big Boo, Pink Boo, and normal Boo Diddley, but they didn&rsquo;t
disturb him when he entered the club. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hand
it over!&rdquo; the dry bones demanded. His buddy, a bony beetle held
a knife to the manager of the club, a sentient orange Gamecube
console. Both baddies clothes consisting of black vests and red
bandannas looked scorched for some reason.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Not
talking? Don&rsquo;t make us use a super symmetry attack on you!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Stop!&rdquo;
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
baddies turned to Parakarry. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know who we are?&rdquo;
the dry bones spat. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re honorary Dry Bonez Thugz, Phil
and Leo.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah!&rdquo;
Leo the bony beetle fist bumped his friend.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
can&rsquo;t take anything from me anyway. My funds are with my banker
and he&rsquo;s a sentient Playstation 3, so you&rsquo;ll never hack
the info out of him!&rdquo; the manager said.<br/>
Phil shoved the
manager backwards hard into the floor chipping some of his plastic.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
is enough!&rdquo; Parakarry rushed forward, and as an ex partner of
Mario, he knew how to battle proper. The Paper Mario style curtains
fell. Parakarry was on the left of the field and Phil and Leo to the
right. The backdrop was the restaurant and the only audience was the
manger and one more traumatized cook who didn&rsquo;t get off early
because his train home happened to be the defunct Toad Town 101. The
irony. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
is this fake looking crap?&rdquo; Leo questioned, looking around.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
know, like it&rsquo;s made out of paper or somethin&rsquo;! Bust this
fool.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Completely
out of turn, they rushed toward Parakarry with their blades in hand.
The whole simulated stage fell apart and right as Phil was about to
toss his blade, aiming at Parakarry&rsquo;s heart, a heavy salt
shaker bopped him in the head. His detachable body broke apart once
more and his head rolled a few feet way. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Shoot!
I hate when this happens!&rdquo; Phil&rsquo;s head grumbled.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Leo spun
around. &ldquo;What the? Who did that?&rdquo; He turned to the
manager and cook. &ldquo;Did you?!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It
was me...&rdquo; </font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">a
very low voice growled. A very plain looking boo diddley revealed
themselves, the same one Parakarry saw out side.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh,
one of you freaks! You&rsquo;d better run, cause this is my strongest
attack, brutha!&rdquo; Leo shot some spikes at the boo, who didn&rsquo;t
flinch when they bounced off harmlessly.</font></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That&rsquo;s
a lie and I knew it. Here, let me show you my strongest attack,
heheh..&rdquo; </font></em>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The boo
ran up to Leo and disappeared again. A bluish glow surrounded Leo and
before he knew it, he was tossed into the restaurant&rsquo;s
dishwasher set to ten. As Leo&rsquo;s muffled screams came from the
appliance, Boo appeared again at Parakarry&rsquo;s side. </font>
</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Are
you okay?&rdquo; </font></em>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Parakarry
wiped the sweat off his face. &ldquo;Yeah, thanks Boo.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Booigi the Second&rsquo;.</font></em>&rdquo; <font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Booigi
turned to the workers. &ldquo;</font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
need to be somewhere safer.&rdquo;</font></em></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No
way,&rdquo; the manager said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be the last
still open club in Toad Town if it kills me.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">But
I would-a like to leave-a!&rdquo; the terrified cook said. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
manager made a face. &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m a talking console. I can&rsquo;t
cook!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yes.
You are closing and that is final.&rdquo;</font></em> 
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo kicked
him of his own restaurant by means of defenestration. He survived
however, because he himself happened to be sentient Gamecube, but his
disk tray lid wouldn&rsquo;t close anymore. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Parakarry
was wide eyed and slowly began to walk away, then ran out screaming
for his life, both him and the cook. Booigi shrugged.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Eh,
buddy,&rdquo; Phil&rsquo;s head said. &ldquo;Umm, could ya at least
place me on that bar table? I think there&rsquo;s mousers crawling on
the ground.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Booigi
chuckled. </font><em>&ldquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sure.&rdquo;
</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo
took a sip from the tap and then burped loudly.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Elsewhere,
Captain Toad was searching for Dr. Toadley. The doctor arrived at the
castle just in time to revive Toad earlier after Russ reported him
passing out, and Russ and the captain got into a bit of an argument
as well over something very silly. He stopped and dug in his backpack
for his phone so that he could check on his vacationing Toad Brigade
squad when he found something else. While resuscitating the Castle
Adviser, someone must have taken his signature blueish purple vest
off to aid in stopping his fever. That didn&rsquo;t explain how the
Captain now had it since he wasn&rsquo;t even in the room due to the
argument.. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">In the
privacy of the halls, he wasn&rsquo;t sure why, but he had the urge
to lift it to his nose and inhale, taking in a mixture of the fabric
softener that was standard issue in the castle and sweat. Captain
Toad checked his back, confirming that he was alone. That was&hellip;
weird. He idly put vest back in his backpack for the time being and
got back on track, sending a short text to Hint Toad and finding the
doctor in Peach&rsquo;s backyard garden, partially submerged in one
of many little holes all over the place, uprooting the vegetation
indiscriminately. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr.
Toadley, sir.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Should
you step there? No you should not!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Captain
took a step back onto the &lsquo;safety&rsquo; of the concrete path.
&ldquo;Thank you for the warning, and for saving Mr. Toad&rsquo;s
life.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Do
not mention it.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
is your progress with the landmines, sir?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Have
I found any? Not yet, but they are near I know.&rdquo; Toadley tossed
aside the little gardening spade he was using as he caught his
breath. &ldquo;-How is Toad by the way?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...He
was okay a little while back, aside from the extra appendages. Why?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Am
I just checking? Yes I am. One can never be too sure, especially with
the people working in THIS castle.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
certainly agree.&rdquo; In Captain Toad&rsquo;s mind, he had at least
three people on a hit list already. &ldquo;What went wrong with Mr.
Toad anyway?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
should know that I could not determine. Could you tear you eyes away
even for a moment as I placed the drum against his abdomen and slowly
moved it upwards to his chest as it rose and lowered? No you could
not.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
left the room when Russ started to fuss with me.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Did
you came back later? Yes you did.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Only
for a second, and I don&rsquo;t remember staring at Mr. Toads, er,
abs.&rdquo; At this point, Captain Toad realized how red in the face
he was.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr.
Toadley began chipping away at stone boarder of the eternal star
fountain again. &ldquo;Should you relax? Yes, I am teasing you. Go
on...heh..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Captain
Toad thought it best if he just forgot that ever happened. Back
inside Morton had one eye pressed against the kitchen door&rsquo;s
key hole with Lemmy, Larry, and Wendy standing with their backs to
the wall.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy
is handing Ludwig an orange test tube. Then a green one. Now it&rsquo;s
bubbling over...&rdquo; There was an explosion sound. &ldquo;Now
Ludwig&rsquo;s face is covered in soot. Iggy is being strangled by
Ludwig. I repeat, he is strangling&hellip; wait, now a death machine
gone awry is chasing them both!&rdquo; Morton reported.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">As Captain
Toad walked past he heard giggles from the group. Whipping around he
shuttered when he saw Lemmy waving around Toad&rsquo;s vest. He felt
a heat wave come over him, even to the tips of his ears.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">How
did you get that?!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
not nice to take things that aren&rsquo;t yours,&rdquo; Lemmy said,
wagging a finger in a mock authoritative tone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Before the
Captain reached him, he tossed it over head to Larry who had ran down
the hall. Before he got to close to the koopaling with a blue mohawk,
it was tossed to Morton. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
stupid children really don&rsquo;t wanna to piss me off..&rdquo;
Captain Toad said, forgoing formality. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not yours.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
don&rsquo;t see what the big deal is, I mean, yeah it&rsquo;s not
ours but it&rsquo;s not yours. What good is a musty old vest to you?
Do you like bad smelling things? Is it a hobby?&rdquo; Morton made a
pass to Wendy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She barely
touched it before holding her nose and sending it to Larry. Larry
made a sort of mouth with his hand and had it kissing the vest. With
a wave of disgust he dropped it finally to the floor.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Now
what are you implying?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
saw you in the hallway earlier. He&rsquo;s good at spying, it&rsquo;s
just his thing, and he saw your nose all in that nasty vest,&rdquo;
Lemmy explained, hardly containing his laughter.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Captain
Toad picked up the vest, balling it in his fists. &ldquo;You speak of
this to no one, now get out of my sight.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
shrugged giving the impression of saying &lsquo;Or what?&rsquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Captain
Toad punched the closest decorative vase with a swift right hook,
making it practically shatter into dust all over the textured floors.
This sent the koopalings running. Right after, Luigi entered the
hallway with Dr. Toadley&rsquo;s intern at his side and stopped at
the mess on the floor. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He sighed.
&ldquo;I see the kids were playing in the halls again. Anyway, how
are you, Stan?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
am quite well, thank you Mr. Luigi.&rdquo; Captain Toad regained his
composure.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Show
me that garden in the back,&rdquo; Mary said, grabbing one of the
tall green plumber&rsquo;s arms.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sure,
but it&rsquo;ll have to be quick. I still need to fix the flooding
issue Toadette told me about.&rdquo; When he got really close he
whispered, &ldquo;And we can discuss the car incident later...&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Was Luigi
threatening him? Well, it didn&rsquo;t matter. They both knew who
would win in a street fight, none other than the guy voted &lsquo;bravest
toad&rsquo; of 2014. Stan, or Captain Toad decided to head out for
some fresh air, but before he left out the front door Russ T. came up
from the basement, dripping wet from waist down. Muttering to himself
the entire time, he opened a closet and pulled out a gray plastic bin
before retreating back down. Captain Toad followed, they had
unfinished business. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sir,
you wouldn&rsquo;t argue for the independence of the BeanBean Kindgom
if you were aware of what befell Giant Land during the Goomba Wars of
Year 334 CE!&rdquo; Captain Toad screamed his rebuttal (that he&rsquo;d
mulled over for a while after &lsquo;losing&rsquo; badly in the
earlier political discussion) down the stair way to no response.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It was
dark and humid due to the basement directly below being inundated by
blueish green flood water and all but abandoned. Russ was walking
through it at the bottom of the stairway leading to the basement,
tugging along that bin that floated.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Captain
Toad rushed to meet him. Russ had only became &lsquo;quiet&rsquo; for
once after his face became glued to the book that was on the bed next
to Toad. From that point on, the historian was apparently a muttering
ceiling artist.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Russ
fiddled around with picture frames on the wall. &ldquo;Delimited by
the natural and bestowed potential by..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Captain
Toad ignored the rambling when he noticed a dark five pointed shape
painted on the floor that wasn&rsquo;t there when he met Toadette
this morning. What was more, it matched perfectly what Russ painted
on the ceilings back in the main lobby. Behind him Russ went back to
work, salvaging random water logged items for the been. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Excuse
me, but you model what you&rsquo;ve painted-?&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Leave
me alone and go bother that castle adviser you&rsquo;re absolutely
infatuated with!&rdquo; Then he added in a whisper like voice, &ldquo;Or
don&rsquo;t. Mr. Toad will never see you the way he does that
Toadette girl anyway.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Captain
Toad flushed angrily as he slung him around, pressing him into the
wall. &ldquo;Excuse me, sir? Please speak up!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Russ
shrugged rather uncharacteristically. &ldquo;You are just another
generic toad to him and your secret fanclub is all a waste. He&rsquo;ll
never love you.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">TAKE
THAT BACK!!!&rdquo; Captain Toad punched right next to Russ&rsquo;s
face, making the blue capped toad duck into the water while the
Captain punched a hole in the dry wall. Breathing heavily, he
realized his mistake. &ldquo;Sir, uh, I&rsquo;m sorry. Hey, where did
you go?&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
will resist no longer, hero.&rdquo;</font></em> <font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Russ
emerged from the water to rush Captain Toad, armed with the a sharp
metal corner end of a picture frame. Hidden behind Russ&rsquo;s
glasses where black starry pupils that Captain Toad would never
notice because he was too busy holding him off.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
knew you were a crazy old man!&rdquo; Captain Toad said, pushing him
down with ease to hold him under the water. It bubbled beneath him
for a while before he finally let Russ up who gasped to catch his
breath. Captain Toad pat him on the back with a patronizing smile.
&ldquo;My apologizes.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Suddenly
Russ head butt Captain Toad, knocking back him onto the star mark on
the ground. It felt soft and rubbery, with some of it pilling off the
ground when he got up and even sticking to the Captain&rsquo;s hands
and clothes. It had an acidic smell and even burned. Thoroughly
freaked out, he made a run for the upstairs when Russ made him trip
up the stairs falling in a way that broke his headlamp on impact and
made his backpack fall off and roll down into the water. The weighty
contents escaped to float in the murky water, including Toad&rsquo;s
very special vest. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Enraged,
Captain Toad punched Russ in the face, hitting his mark this time.
Down he went on the upper dry portion of the steps headfirst with a
small almost inaudible snap. Feeling his stomach churn, Captain Toad
waited for Russ spring up and try something else, only&hellip;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
librarian never moved again.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The star
symbol on the floor and the black stuff that was once on the
Captain&rsquo;s hands was gone. Numbly walking back to the lobby, the
stars on the ceiling were gone yet still there. Black stars seemed to
follow him in his mind...</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Outside,
Dr. Toadley was now destroying the front yard using a snow shovel as
his excavating tool. He was currently knee deep into one large hole,
not far from where Bowser&rsquo;s Airship was parked.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Let
me dig the rest of this one. I want to bury my time capsule in it
later, if we don&rsquo;t find a mine.&rdquo; Captain Toad sat a heavy
and wet plastic bin down with a lid firmly on it. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr.
Toadley climbed out of the hole. &ldquo;Is that a wonderful idea? It
is. I have already found ten mines.&rdquo; He held up coin sized
objects that resembled pebbles, then slipped them away. &ldquo;What
is in the capsule?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Uh,
a secret, sir.&rdquo; Captain Toad, now a shadow of his former self
without his signature headlamp or backpack, got to work for a few
minutes, trying to plan exactly he would avoid becoming subject to
guillotine due to what was possibly the third worst situation he&rsquo;d
even been thrust into.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ah,
have I found mine #11? Yes I have!&rdquo; Dr. Toadley suddenly said
from a hole adjacent to his. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Captain
Toad paused.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Topper
sat down as his desk once all of his students were stetted at their
computers and playing online games or whatever youths did. He often
used the computer lab to let his class have fun under the guise of it
being a therapy. They weren&rsquo;t really learning anything, but
they deserved some fun and they always loved the ride and visuals
from Donut Plains to Special World. It also kelp his mind off the
nasty custody battle he dealt with at home.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He opened
a drawer where there was a little bottle. While hiding his hands
under the desk, he poured a little into a small shot glass and downed
it. The liquid warmed him from within and he was relaxed again.
Someone knocked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A nurse
came in. &ldquo;Hey, can I use one of these?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
Dr. Toad&rsquo;s new assistant, Sue.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Topper
paused at the sight of the rough looking boo. &ldquo;Go ahead. I see
Dr. Toad isn&rsquo;t a complete loner for once.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The dark
boo chuckled dryly as he went to a computer. &ldquo;Guess not. How do
you know, Drew, or Dr. Toad I mean?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Topper
walked to where he was. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been an associate since he
was elected president. It&rsquo;s kind of funny, he&rsquo;s always
been cold to me from the start but never fired me. Even when I try to
quit he hesitates. I don&rsquo;t really get him, no offense.&rdquo;
He noticed the CDROM his new guest held with &lsquo;take control over
your mind. 100% works&rsquo; scribbled on in sharpie, making him
frown slightly. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t pay for that, did you?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No.&rdquo;
</font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That&rsquo;s
a relief. Have fun.&rdquo; Dr. Topper made way back to his desk.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sue gave
him a mischievous smile behind his back. &ldquo;I can tell you&rsquo;re
a cool dude. You wanna know something? You wouldn&rsquo;t have to
share the custody with your second ex wife if you made went ahead and
just told her supervisor that she cheats the taxes.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Topper
froze in place. &ldquo;While I don&rsquo;t agree with what she does,
I could never ruin her life just because- Wait, who told you that??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr.
Topper! Dr. Topper!&rdquo; a purple yoshi preteen said. &ldquo;Your
phone is vibrating on the table.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His text
message said: &ldquo;Visitor at front door.&rdquo; Dr. Topper as
unofficially elected as the &lsquo;least weird associate of the
hospital&rsquo; was oft sent to answer the door, especially when
someone ostensibly important showed up. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Topper
left the computer lab, making a note to recheck his privacy settings
on social media. The hammer brother knew he was an open book, and any
one of Topper&rsquo;s behavioral class could have put that kind of
sensitive info on his page. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The metal
sliding door opened and Dr. Topper reached for the hand of the black
shelled noki who wore a loose black tie over a green Hawaiian shirt
for some reason.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hello.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Greetings,&rdquo;
Jelectro Bond said. &ldquo;I am from the Special World government,
just doing a census on enemy species working here.&rdquo; Bond handed
over a check list that he&rsquo;d written out on notebook paper with
several common enemies on it, &lsquo;dark boo&rsquo; curiously being
the first on the list.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Topper
benevolent stance dropped. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t help
you.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
understand you are busy. It&rsquo;ll only be a moment, mon ami.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Don&rsquo;t
call me your friend first of all. Secondly, no one is an &lsquo;enemy
species&rsquo; to me. Why judge someone as an enemy just because of
what they are? Do you think I&rsquo;m one too? Huh?!?&rdquo; He
pushed the paper back into Bond&rsquo;s chest.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It
was just an expression!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah,
one that damages the social rights of eighty percent of the
population. I watch over kids that are abandoned and alone. Do you
know that &lsquo;enemy species&rsquo; are three times as likely to be
given up than toads and friendly species??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond
stepped back at his animation, getting the same feeling he did around
Kylie, though he couldn&rsquo;t come up with exactly what it was.
Either way, there wasn&rsquo;t time to argue politics. &ldquo;Let me
rephrase. Is there a recent hire that&rsquo;s a dark boo here? I am
also checking forms and he did not do so correctly when hired.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Topper
crossed his arms. &ldquo;Oh that. Just one moment.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">When the
hammer brother went back inside, Dr. Toad was waiting for him
fidgeting around nervously.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well??
It went bad, didn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Why
would you say that?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
saw the visitor from the window. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. You
seemed kind of ticked off when entering. Did you explain that we&rsquo;re
up to code?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
wants to see your new assistant because didn&rsquo;t fill out some
forms or something.&rdquo; Dr. Topper pat the sweat off of his face
from the rapid onset anger. &ldquo;Not sure where that tantrum came
from..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond was
outside checking his Rolex when he saw something down the street.
Kicking up a big cloud of power blue dust was the van of the MKDCU
speeding like they were on a drag strip. &ldquo;Merde!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oooh,
you said a bad word..&rdquo; Zoo answered at the door. &ldquo;Actually
I don&rsquo;t care. What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond
grabbed his arm. &ldquo;Turn invisible and follow me!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo&rsquo;s
jaw dropped. &ldquo;Oh crap. You&rsquo;re Jelectro Bond!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Shh!
I am saving your life. Do it, Zoo.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
sprint to the vehicle. Just as Bond hit the push button ignition, his
face collided with the steering wheel as the van plowed into the car
from behind and dragged it down the road.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">This
is super exciting, hehe!&rdquo; Zoo exclaimed in the passenger seat.
He&rsquo;d face planted into the dash also, but thankfully Bond
couldn&rsquo;t see how much more ugly it&rsquo;d made him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond threw
off his broken sunglasses and felt a cut above his eye. He stomp the
gas and swerved to the left, going off road. The van stayed parallel
with them and from the street as James leaned out of the backseat
window and fired a mafia gangster styled weapon. The bullets still
sounded like little explosions as they pelted the car, the bullet
proof nature of the car being the only thing saving them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo turned
to Bond. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve met those guys before and they&rsquo;re
real softies. I could liquefy their brains if I could concentrate-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Don&rsquo;t!!!
They are out of their minds right now.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond eased
up on the gas just enough to let the van get slightly ahead, then he
swerved towards its rear wheel, making the top heavy vehicle spin out
and fly off the road, landing into patches of green, blue, red, and
yellow flowers. Bond continued to drive without looking back. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So
like&hellip;&rdquo; Zoo said in the car after they&rsquo;d driven for
five more tense minutes and his heart stop beating out of his chest.
He was visible now. &ldquo;Are you going to arrest me?&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond
studied him in his peripheral vision. He&rsquo;d never been so close
to Zoo before and was more surprised than he thought he&rsquo;d be to
see that he really was a typical boo and not some imposing monster.. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No,
I am not arresting you. How did you know my name?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo stared
out the window. &ldquo;Hard to explain. Let&rsquo;s just say an old
co-worker told me.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Interesting.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
are taking measures to conceal your actions. I know what happened to
Mitch. I think it&rsquo;s too late for him now.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo turned
around quickly. &ldquo;Crap. I wasn&rsquo;t trying to-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
know. Just&hellip; forget your past transgressions from this point
on. I wish I could have gotten more info from Kylie before she went
mad but the way she spoke about hunting you down felt ominous and I
just knew I had to intervene. Could you explain about the bell? I
gleaned it from Kylie&rsquo;s notebook.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo went
back to staring at the road. &ldquo;This is going to sound weird. I
took it from my dad a long time ago because he made me mad. It was
just this really old thing he had with some other junk, but it caused
some freaky stuff to happen like portals, loud noises, pants wetting
stuff. I never had an issue with it again for years until a few weeks
ago. It always seems to follow me and I thought I heard it ring on
its own.&rdquo; Zoo opened the glove compartment, and there it was.
It&rsquo;s yellow glow lit the car up before he put it away. &ldquo;See?
I guess you know about the homicides at the train stations too then.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond cut
the radio on low. &ldquo;Yes. You have to understand, clingy objects
tend to want to preserve their owners, not destroy them. I will work
with you until we solve this.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh,
that enemy of my enemy thing I guess, Bond guy?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
do not think any of us are the real enemies,&rdquo; Bond replied
vaguely. &ldquo;Either way, you look beaten. Perhaps you slept on a
train, on your right side, and you got into a fight with a hobo who
was dead when you woke up. Take a sip of the Absinthe in that cup
holder, you&rsquo;re of legal age, oui?&rdquo; Bond noticed Zoo
staring at him with astonishment. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a detective, and
quite talented with brain waves like you.&rdquo; Bond slid his
glasses down, unabashedly revealing his eyes. &ldquo;Do not use my
friendly gesture to try anything funny, mon ami.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo only
smiled and slyly. It was the time of day when they played tracks from
independent artists so an oddly fitting &lsquo;Reprisal in A minor&rsquo;
by Ludwig Von Koopa played all the way down the long road back to
town.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Miles back
on the road: Wiggletron bent back into shape the metal axle of their
truck, being hindered by the slick oil that covered his body and
Sebastian&rsquo;s shaky grip with the flash light. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
think I have finally made sufficient contact between the tire and
axle.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">James got
into the drivers seat. &ldquo;Good work, Wiggs. Imma give it a go.&rdquo;
Once everyone got out of the way, James slipped into neutral and let
the van coast about ten feet before the car sunk back with the tire
popping off and rolling away.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;ll
get it!&rdquo; Sebastian chased after the tire.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
no dern use!&rdquo; Parabilly threw his straw had down. &ldquo;Our
livelihood is gone and the misses down home ain&rsquo;t gonna let us
use my personal truck. Not after what happened last time.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">For
your info Billy, it&rsquo;s not my fault that plate of steaming hot
nachos spilled in the back seat. I can&rsquo;t help not having arms.
Besides, blame her for this mess!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Richard
was talking about Kylie, who silently sat crisscross on the ground
the entire time since the crash. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve ran Bond out and
he was alone. Zoo is all ours.&rdquo; She got up holding a can of boo
repellent. &ldquo;After I spray shoot, one of you.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">James
stood before her. &ldquo;Hold up girl. Youse ain&rsquo;t the boss
here. I-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie held
James up by the collar. &ldquo;I am paying you, so I am indeed. Do as
I say or your &lsquo;axle&rsquo; will be broken.&rdquo; She dropped
him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After an
uncomfortable moment the MKDCU agents eventually abandoned the van
and followed Kylie&rsquo;s unflinching walk towards the Special World
Hospital.</font></p>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Geno hated
to sit around when who knows was happening on Earth, yet here he was.
Bored, he picked out shapes and patterns on the sapphire colored
floor when the sparky and impenetrable caged door swung open.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The star
jailer, dressed in silvery armor, stood in the doorway tall and
imposingly. &ldquo;Thou hath been summoned before the judge.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Geno was
escorted into a grand coliseum in the middle of space, where the
session was in progress. Six members of Eldstar&rsquo;s household
were all up on the witness stands while he himself was nervously
seated at a desk as the defendant. Dark Ztar slouched on the
prosecutor side, even yawning. Starslaps with cold dark unfeeling
eyes were all lined and packed in the jury box and the gallery were
star beings holding signs either for or against the star spirits.
Meanwhile Judge Rosalina, dressed in elegant blue dress, announced
the charges.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dark
Ztar is charging for attempted assault, vandalism, abuse of power,
and invasion of privacy.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What?!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Setteth
thy buttocks down and husht!&rdquo; the baliff told Geno. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
platinum blonde continued. &ldquo;Now that we have every witness for
the defense in the courtroom, wait. Where is Millennium Star?&rdquo; </font>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Rosalina
nodded to the baliff. &ldquo;Then by refusing to defend himself, he
will be considered guilty.&rdquo; She slammed a mallet. &ldquo;What
is your testimony?&rdquo; she asked the witnesses. &ldquo;Dark Star
claims you spy on him from some kind of &lsquo;com-pu-ter.&rsquo;&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Klevar
broke the ice. &ldquo;I only searched information about Dark Ztar
that was publicly available.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Misstar
was so far stooped down to conceal herself, only her oversized ribbon

sighed in relief. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Order!&rdquo;
Rosalina wrinkled her nose. &ldquo;If the crowds do not control
themselves, this case can and will become closed to the public.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;d
like to make an objection!&rdquo; In flash Dark Ztar&rsquo;s attorney
appeared in the courtroom. A green sickly looking star with deep
black eyes, Zeostar, wore a blue tie and held a suitcase. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dark Ztar
perked up at the sight of his attorney, glaring at his cousin. &ldquo;Here
is evidence of Eldstar and his ruffian family&rsquo;s escapades!&rdquo;
He snapped open an old dusty laptop that had crashed and showed a
blue screen.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Rosalina
and the bailiff traded an uncertain glance, then she tapped the
table. &ldquo;Is there an expert who knows if it is supposed to be
that way? You two may come to the bench.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Just like
winners on a TV game show, the yellow male and pink female star that
Rosalina had chosen got up from their seats and skipped down the
steps, ignoring the jealous audience booing them except for the part
when the female sucker punched a jock looking star that catcalled
her. So the two approached Rosalina:</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
work at Geek Squad,&rdquo; the yellow star, Aurelius Pun announced
proudly.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yep,&rdquo;
Iris Rage, his companion said. &ldquo;That laptop is busted by
spyware.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">SPYware?&rdquo;
Rosalina repeated. Members of the audience showed concern. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Actually
Miss Rosalina, spyware isn&rsquo;t put on a computer by a spy. It
just means he picked up a virus somewhere online,&rdquo; Aurelius
explained.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">On...line?
Is that where you can speak to others electronically? Like, say,
Twatter?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;m
not following,&rdquo; Iris said.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Aurelius
nudged her. &ldquo;Good one!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
wasn&rsquo;t a joke.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Everyone
stared blankly and so Rosalina slammed the mallet. &ldquo;You two may
sit. If the defendants are as confused as I am, I highly doubt they
have infiltrated the prosecutor&rsquo;s computer. What does the jury
say?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">INNOCENT,&rdquo;
the slapstars said in a perfect chorus.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Let
us move on to the next charge of vandalism. I want &#9825;&#9834;!?
and Eldstar on the witness stand.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
great&hellip;&rdquo; Geno grumbled from his seat. He went to the
stand with Eldstar.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
did it,&rdquo; Geno and Eldstar confessed simultaneously. They turned
to each other in surprise, as they&rsquo;d expected the other to lie
so that their contradictory response would hopefully cause confusion
and buy time, except being who they were, nothing went as plan.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The mallet
was slammed. &ldquo;Well that was easy. Time for a recess!&rdquo;
Rosalina jovially got up from her seat. &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; she
said quietly to the bailiff. &ldquo;I am curious as to what this
&lsquo;internet&rsquo; is all about!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
bailiff grinned knowingly. &ldquo;Just beest careful with that
internet, princess. It&rsquo;d beest a shame to receiveth hath lost
in thither, and there&rsquo;s few or none will entertain it thee
doth, doth not behold up thy own name on Google Images!</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The sky
was taking on a red cloudy hue, the black hole in the sky had grown
during the evening, and the castle's moat overflowed by six feet, but
everyone&rsquo;s attention was on Ludwig as he stood before everyone
outside near the entrance of Peach&rsquo;s Castle. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
am pleased to announce that the modified cure for Mushoom Flu X is
complete, if you have not noticed by the fact that the kitchen is
accessible.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
koopalings conspicuously hid snacks stolen from Peach&rsquo;s
cupboards behind their back. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Thus,
we can make plans to deliver the cure the moment King Dad, the
princess and the others are back!&rdquo; Everyone began to clap. When
the clapping would die down someone would start again and rouse it up
all over. This as annoying as it sounded. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">How
did you do it since this strand mutated?&rdquo; Mary asked over the
noise. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It
was only a matter of reducing the stardust, Mushroom, and fruit to
their basic chemical elements!- EVERYONE SHUT UP! -And then
distilling the mixture with the active ingredients to Dr. Mario&rsquo;s
megavitamins.&rdquo; After a pause Ludwig added, &ldquo;Someone
should send him a card. I am not too proud to admit my shortcomings
and this speedy development of the new formula all would not have
been possible without the hours of research he did on the Mushroom
Flu beforehand.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig&rsquo;s
right. Huh. That&rsquo;s kind of nice of you actually.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
glanced at Luigi with a hint of admiration. &ldquo;Thank you. Working
with you today was not an entirely miserable experience..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
doc&rsquo;s my homeboy back at Smash Mansion. I&rsquo;ll send one,&rdquo;
Toad scratched his back with his third arm as he&rsquo;d been itchy
the entire time. &ldquo;Umm, that reminds me. That leak downstairs
has flooded the basement up and screwed up the septic tank. No one
take a shower in the meantime. I learned that the hard way.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
held her nose. &ldquo;So THATS what I smell??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi put
his palm to his face. &ldquo;I forgot about the flood. I&rsquo;m on
it.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">DAISY
ALSO!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And
me too!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daisy,
Toad, no!&rdquo; Luigi said right before he got knocked over into the
grass by the brunette and mushroom retainer. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Buckenberry
slumped. &ldquo;I wished girls and guys were all over me&hellip;&rdquo;
</font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Me
too, what a bishonen!&rdquo; Anime style lighting bolts went from
Iggy&rsquo;s eyes to Luigi in a bizarre visual effect that only he
saw. &ldquo;I bet Luigi never needs to use womanizing spray!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thomas
came out of the castle doors. &ldquo;Can I go home now? My uncle&rsquo;s
relocated down south.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After
you clean the lobby,&rdquo; Toadette said. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thomas
turned around with a huff. &ldquo;This wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem if
Captain Toad hadn&rsquo;t tracked the mud in!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
Captain had been present only physically until that point. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
clean it up myself,&rdquo; he mumbled.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">This
meeting is adjourned. Someone help me load up the airship.&rdquo;
Nose in the air, Ludwig marched away.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Eventually
everyone else also went on their separate ways and Captain Toad was
alone with only the sounds of the birds and wind. He went inside to
clean up the floor, his mind still on many things when someone
entered. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey,
homeboy.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Captain
Toad spun around and there was Toad Toad standing merely two feet
from him. Instantly he began to sweat.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Say,
we really do look alike when you don&rsquo;t have all your fancy
equipment on,&rdquo; Toad continued.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Because
I&rsquo;m your biggest fan.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
left it in my van&hellip; My equipment,&rdquo; Captain Toad
sputtered. &ldquo;Uh, sir. I have.. something to tell you about the
castle&rsquo;s librarian.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Russ?
Okay, what?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He&rsquo;s
retired. Forever.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
shrugged. &ldquo;Really and without a trace? Well, I don&rsquo;t
blame him. Where&rsquo;d he go?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
went &lsquo;south&rsquo;?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
reached up for a high five. &ldquo;You know what this means, right?
His tyrannical door closing polices are over!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Captain
Toad raised his hand to his, and held it there maybe too long. &ldquo;Sir,
one other thing.&rdquo; If there was one person he could tell it
would be him so after taking a deep breath-</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Let&rsquo;s
go Toad!&rdquo; Daisy interrupt. She cartwheeled through the lobby in
her own mutated green skinned form.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Gotta
go. Keep in touch, okay?&rdquo; Toad followed Daisy without a hitch.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Captain
Toad stood for a moment, then lashed out by punched the wall once or
twice. After hearing snickering he followed the patter of koopaling
feet up many stairs. He went all the way up to the fourth floor,
reaching the top just as an electronic sliding door closed tight.
Prying it open, he found a figure seated before a large grandfather
clock. The small koopaling turned around with a playful look. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wanna
see a trick?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Captain
Toad realized his holster felt empty and then a shot went off on the
ground near his feet.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ha
ha ha! Lemmy&rsquo;s such an entertainer! An experienced one! A pro!&rdquo;
Morton came away from an alcove in the wall rolling in laughter.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Give
that back right now,&rdquo; The Captain hissed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
twirled around the zapper. &ldquo;I just wanted to show you some
tricks, like-&rdquo; Lemmy tossed it up into the air, making Captain
Toad dive to the ground. The gun landed in Lemmy&rsquo;s hands
stylishly then he blasted a random house plant to smithereens. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Captain
Toad glared just as the lights went out in the room, leaving only the
orange glow of candle light. For a moment the Captain wasn&rsquo;t
sure if he&rsquo;d somehow made that happen, only to be disappointed
when there was the distant sound of thunder. A storm was coming.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
dropped the gun with a high pitched squeal. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
of the dark!! Let us out!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Morton
went for the door and beat on it. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s locked, sealed,
inoperable!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">From the
other side, something else bang on the star door. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
joined Morton. &ldquo;Okay, maybe whoever that is will get help.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">How
could this happen?&rdquo; Morton asked. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Save
it, koopas. These electronic locks will never open unless the power
is restored,&rdquo; Captain Toad said. The certified marksman
retrieved his zapper to find that it was still loaded. The two
Koopalings turned to Captain Toad. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Are
you going to do what you did to that Pianta guy??&rdquo; Lemmy asked
tearfully.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After a
weighty pause Captain Toad raised it and grimaced.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Had
Toadette not been tasked with the clean up of a kitchen considered
beyond repair to anyone less determined than her, she might have
heard the single boom from upstairs, but instead she was zoned out
while washing pots and pans and nodding along with headphones on. The
song was mildly chaotic. It almost sounded like something Ludwig
might conduct...</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
yes, I met the most wonderful Nigerian Prince using a thing called
e-mail&hellip;&rdquo; Rosalina realized her mic was on with a flush.
&ldquo;-And so the recess is over.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
witness hath arrived,&rdquo; said the bailiff. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ushered in
from the left of the courtroom came Reggie the Business Bro dressed
in a white robe. &ldquo;Eldstar is indeed vengeful.&rdquo; Reggie got
in the witness stand. &ldquo;As of yesterday, my five children are
now without their father!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Actually,
your honor, the strike did not originate from me,&rdquo; Eldstar
replied. &ldquo;Reggie J. Business Bro was zapped because he was
attempting to use Dark Ztar&rsquo;s power to strike Bowser Koopa, the
intended target.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Rosalina
turned to Reggie. &ldquo;Is this true? Were you trying to zap
anyone?&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No!!...
Well maybe&hellip; But I had a business to run and that Bowser guy
ruined it.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
has happened to your business since?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;ve
started an Overthere division but they are a tough crowd and too many
are on a diet to drink my sodas!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A ringtone
went off from behind Rosalina&rsquo;s desk, making her fumble to
silence it. &ldquo;Excuse that, I am still learning this new iPhone.
Now as for you that is unfortunate, but it does not concern this
case. You are dismissed.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Reggie
muttered under his breath as he was escorted out while Dark Ztar
clapped in mock.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Good
show! Tell me Great Eldstar, how exactly did HE get struck instead?
It&rsquo;s like you knew what his message to me was, hmm? Go on.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zeostar
opened the suitcase and pulled out a tablet. &ldquo;Here Eldstar is
admitting that he has an item that violates the rules regarding the
balance of good and evil millenniums ago.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
is absolutely ridiculous,&rdquo; Skolar spoke up for the first time.
&ldquo;The Great Eldstar is the epitome of fair and good, if he was
not he would not be himself. If he was not himself he could not
exist. Without the existence of Eldstar our entire council could not
be established and we would not be here now. That evidence has to be
completely rubbish.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Anxiously
everyone waited while Zeostar hit a switch and the floor of the
coliseum became crystal clear to provide a screen. The video was
filmed by a shaky phone camera held by Dark Ztar. He knocked on the
door of the Star Temple and was let in. A banner that said &lsquo;Family
Reunion&rsquo; was tied high above in the ceiling and the area
bustled with various stars, all up in age, socializing in various
halls.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dark Ztar
dart straight to his cousin drink bar serving punch from a bowl. &ldquo;Say
chap, I have a question for you. Why is Goomba Bieber still alive
when I get about a thousand requests to annihilate him everyday?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Eldstar,
swaying a lot, showed his old pager patched up with tape. &ldquo;I
can change the messages,&rdquo; He downed another cup. &ldquo;But I
only do so rarely! Okay, sometimes. Okay, yesterday.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
really now?&rdquo; Dark Ztar said mischievously from behind the
camera. &ldquo;Is not that cheating?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Not
if it is saving lives. Besides, if it was up to the people of Earth
to execute, angry teenagers would have wished every young pop star
dead. I like some of them, say that Generation Z and Atari and iiii.
You know?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Actually,
I am indeed a fan of the toad girl group-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dark Ztar
quickly shut off the film with his cheeks red. &ldquo;So there! You
heard it folks!&rdquo; he announced as others gasped in disbelief. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Let
us wrap it up. What does the jury say Eldstar abusing his power?&rdquo;
Rosalina asked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">One
starslap stood before the rest. &ldquo;As the jury we say Eldstar is
GUILTY!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So
in conclusion, ah, no need to read it all out again. They failed
miserably!&rdquo; Rosalina slammed the mallet and the gallery spilled
out down onto the floor and everywhere else with a thunderous rumble.
Unbothered, Rosalina was instantly messing around with her new iPhone
again and the bailiffs and other members of the court joked among
themselves. There was a dark cloud in the court, but it only hung
over eight individuals.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Geno threw
his hands in the air. &ldquo;Didn't you at least see the camera aimed
at you?!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Eldstar
stared blankly at the star warrior. &ldquo;So that is how he did it?
I thought he was just holding his phone funny.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And
what happened to that logic?!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Skolar
frowned. &ldquo;Cameras defy logic with their mysterious ability to
capture the past.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Did
you all know about the pager situation?&rdquo; Eldstar asked,
thinking about something.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yes,
Great Eldstar,&rdquo; Klevar said solemnly. &ldquo;But we never
however fathomed that we would be sued over it!&rdquo;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dark Ztar
was proudly walking past the golden towers of millennia that lined
the outside of the court when someone jumped out in front of him.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
know you&rsquo;ve done something, Zach.&rdquo; Blocking Dark Ztar&rsquo;s
path, Geno went full X-Files on him. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t place it
at first, but you used Zoo as a catalyst because he had history with
the bell. Zoo Diddley&rsquo;s psychological reports had eye witness
statements. Hundreds of people saw a dark star emerge from a portal
the day Zoo rung that bell, so explain that. Plus that portal is on
Earth right now. And you thought this lawsuit would shake me off of
your tail? Ha!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Caught in
the moment, Geno tackled the dark star down, hearing something also
fall to the ground and crack.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A deep
growl emitted from the monocled star&rsquo;s throat as he tossed Geno
off. &ldquo;You buffoon!! I have not had a presence on Earth in a
very long time!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Geno
quickly scooped up the broken phone device before too many people
noticed. &ldquo;Sorry. My phone&rsquo;s like that and it still
works.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dark Ztar
jerked it away. &ldquo;Capital! It&rsquo;s bloody busted! I turn
434,324,356,234 today and this is what I get? There&rsquo;s only one
other dark star I know in this part of the galaxy and I rest assure
you chap, she is OLD news. Now, I suppose you want another charge
don&rsquo;t you!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zeostar
swung around the corner. &ldquo;Hey! He&rsquo;s giving you trouble?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Geno
turned to run, but he couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about that last
part. What other dark star??</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
battered Aston Mushroom puttered through another back alley to stop
behind a building. Bond rolled down the window, which fell out and
shattered on the floor. He turned to his companion in jest. &ldquo;Think
you can give me the tour?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Coming
around front they were at the Mushroom Press. Zoo followed Bond when
he ducked under some undone wooden boards, having nothing else to do
than to play along with the noki. It was dark inside with papers
strolled about and file cabinets hanging open. Zoo found something
he&rsquo;d left at his old desk under &lsquo;Susie Que&rsquo;, a
small framed watercolor where a black and red color swirled together
to become a dark circle in the middle. &lsquo;Assimilation&rsquo; as
it was called, painted by Drew years back.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Meanwhile
Bond sat in an empty chair and dialed a number. &ldquo;Just checking
on you.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There was
commotion in the background including the sound of a choo choo train,
indicating to Bond that Agent N didn&rsquo;t have his office door
closed like usual. &ldquo;Getting pampered in the tropics?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Not
exactly.&rdquo; Bond lifted one arm and regretted it. He hadn&rsquo;t
had a chance to shower considering he slept in the car last night
after leaving Kylie&rsquo;s house. &ldquo;Have you heard from your
niece?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She&rsquo;s
down south with no progress but spies have reported that Bowser and
the Princess made a truce to develop a cure sometime before leaving
the country. Did you know there&rsquo;s another issue in Toad Town
now and we&rsquo;re suspecting a death ray? Between that and our
satellite disguised as a Sky Land shuttle getting eaten up by a black
hole in the sky, aren&rsquo;t you glad you&rsquo;re nowhere near Toad
Town?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond
adjusted his collar. &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">All
you should worry about... Tell me, Agent,&rdquo; Agent N said in a
lower voice, &ldquo;how are you fairing having to stay indoors all of
the time with that tropical storm sweeping through?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
fine here. If it stormed, I slept through it!&rdquo; Bond glanced at
the weather forecast in a nearby paper and hoped he was right.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">..Over
and out.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond hung
up unsure if that was a good or bad response. Did his superior not
trust him? Had he been discovered by fellow spies? And even worse, if
they discovered his association with Zoo they&rsquo;d never
understand. He went to Zoo who was still nosing around his old
office.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mon
ami, can I see the bell again? We need to learn more.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo tossed
him the bell super hard on purpose, but Bond caught it anyway being a
&lsquo;shortstop&rsquo; in every meaning of the word.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">If
you HAVE to know Mr. Sherlock Mario, ask my parents. Drew told me
they&rsquo;re just out of town, &lsquo;retired&rsquo;. Stop that
stupid smiling because that&rsquo;s the last place you&rsquo;ll ever
drag me.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond
examined surprisingly heavy object that had a warm glow. &ldquo;If
your parents hold the clues, that is where-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond
looked upwards abruptly. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah,
that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Zoo spat. &ldquo;You saved me that one
time but now we&rsquo;re through. I bet you think its my
responsibility or something even though I was HIRED to drop off the
sodas off with a &lsquo;for free&rsquo; sign on it. That whole
hospital thing was me getting bored at the press over there. Do you
see any windows in that corner? Of course not, so I made a prank call
based on some newspaper clippings in Steve&rsquo;s office. I didn&rsquo;t
think that entire hospital was corrupt enough to take it seriously.
That gang thing? I just ran into the wrong knucklehead pinatas.&rdquo;
Zoo cornered Bond against the cubicle walls, baring sharp teeth. &ldquo;And
while you might be &lsquo;special&rsquo; you don&rsquo;t fool me.
When this is all over, THEN you&rsquo;ll just turn me in and I&rsquo;ll
be right back where I started. Medicated again in an asylum with no
job or life!!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond
stared back with a perplexed melancholy before sighing. &ldquo;I
would never do that, but if you still want to go that is fine.&rdquo;
Bond held the board blocking the entrance. &ldquo;Please be careful.&rdquo;
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo came
up slowly. &ldquo;Sooo, I&rsquo;m free?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Of
course. Just clarify one thing. You were &lsquo;medicated&rsquo; at
some point, but now you aren&rsquo;t?&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
paused. &ldquo;Yep. The prescription ran out a week ago and I never
bothered. Will you piss off now?&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo phased
through the wall instead of taking Bond&rsquo;s kind gesture, but he
didn&rsquo;t mind. He only watched Zoo for a moment before dodging
back inside to Kylie&rsquo;s station. All of her work was present,
including Mitch&rsquo;s journal. He thumbed through a few pages and
became fixated on a single page containing a detailed sketch of a
black colored star that he must have missed yesterday. &lsquo;Dark&rsquo;
stars were everywhere starting today, from becoming a component of
anarchist symbols, to being the shape of the ash left behind in the
Toad Town 101 subway incident, to being in the skies. He jot down his
thoughts: the bell brought a &lsquo;dark star&rsquo; to Earth
fourteen years ago on a small scale once. Kylie&rsquo;s notes said
Zoo was put in institutions right after yet its resurgence is right
after he&rsquo;s unmediated? He could only speculate the connection
between the bell and Zoo&rsquo;s powers. He just knew that malevolent
objects attached to people usually protect their owners, not the
opposite. To see the latter was unusual indeed. He packed up and went
back outside around the back.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond
didn&rsquo;t plan on completely losing touch with Zoo go since
anything could happen, but he didn&rsquo;t think the reunion would be
so soon. Someone was digging in the trunk of his ramshackled car. His
borrowed ramshackled car. And Agent N&rsquo;s expensive items were
littering the grimy alley floor.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
could have asked if you needed some spare coins.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
jolted, banging his own head on the trunk lid. &ldquo;Oww!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond
stepped up to the pile of dress clothes, cuff links, and even an
expensive watch, all untouched. What wasn&rsquo;t untouched was the
wrapper of a devoured choco-bar. &ldquo;These aren&rsquo;t mine
obviously. They&rsquo;d drag the floor.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dude.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You&rsquo;re
starving.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Get
out of my head,&rdquo; Zoo hissed.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
wasn&rsquo;t. You ignored the valuables for the one snack. I&rsquo;ll
take you somewhere and then drop you off.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oddly
calmed down, Zoo gave up and got back in the passenger seat where
he&rsquo;d started. Surprisingly, he didn&rsquo;t hate it that much.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">One
&lsquo;doctor&rsquo; was observing a crazed yoshi in a cage
practically bouncing off of its walls. The dinosaur was &lsquo;coma
walking&rsquo; and his meters were going off the charts. The metallic
portly intern of sorts was hanging around to hold the place for the
actual doctor chosen to be an associate on the Case X project, the
last one actually but arguably the most important. So he stood and
sipped from the silver canister borrowed from Dr. Topper. That
Chuckola Cola hit the spot!</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
health inspectors are here!&rdquo; a goomba doctor screamed while
passing the door. Metal Mario took his time leaving.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Outside,
the MKDCU thought they had all of the associates of the Special World
Hospital lined up against the building. Richard dragged Dr. Toad out
last as rain began to sprinkle down. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
handed over his papers to Richard. &ldquo;Will this be quick?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sure
shortie!&rdquo; The burly goomba towered over Dr. Toad, making him
shiver. &ldquo;Just gotta make sure you're up to date.&rdquo; Richard
tossed the badge over to Wiggletron.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
detect no fraudulence here.&rdquo; Raindrops pattered the flower on
the tall wiggler&rsquo;s head and he clinched his side where he&rsquo;d
gotten his phantom injury from when Sebastian attracted cultists
during an expedition abroad in a Spear Guy village. The poison dart
injury that was actually neither poison nor dart still acted up on
rainy days. Which was&hellip; today.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Parabilly
also found Dr. Toad&rsquo;s badge and the papers representing all
associates just fine. He put on his straw hat and handed the
documents to James. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Where
is your assistant, dear fellow?&rdquo; Morris whispered to Dr. Toad.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve never had these kinds of health agents here. They
might want a higher bribe than usual.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
government person still has Sue but his warrant wasn&rsquo;t even
active in Special World so there&rsquo;s no way they know about that
anyway.&rdquo; Dr. Toad dug in his back pocket. &ldquo;Also I have
this. No worries.&rdquo; There was a shiny gold &lsquo;Master Plan&rsquo;
credit card in his hands.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Meanwhile
dapper monty mole squint at the papers for a time too short to have
read anything. &ldquo;It's all good boys. Guess those ten patients
are fine in your care except, yep, we have those travel costs and
there were a few issues that we could forget about if-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">On
it!&rdquo; Dr. Toad rushed forward with the card. &ldquo;You have a
terminal, correct?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Everyone&rsquo;s
eyes turned to Billy.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well
I reckon I can find it in my bag. The terminal connects to the serial
port adapter I installed in the mini-pci slot on my laptop,&rdquo;
the parakoopa explained.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Translation:
We&rsquo;re actually about to get paid for once!&rdquo; Richard said.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sebastian
dropped to his knees, teary eyed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve waited all my
life for this!!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Actually
it has been eight days, five hours, and twenty-three minutes since
our last paycheck,&rdquo; Wiggs clarified.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Stop!
Everyone freeze!!!&rdquo; Kylie came up from behind with her eyes
glued to some of the documents. &ldquo;You claim forty eight
associates but I see forty seven, brother.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
swallowed hard. &ldquo;It must be a miscount. Someone from Dr.
Topper&rsquo;s class might have gotten counted by mistake.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Topper
and his class waved. &ldquo;I remember you. That's Kylie and she's a
reporter. I&rsquo;ll call you if I get any news.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
threw the papers to the ground as thunder boomed and the downpour
began. &ldquo;Where is that last person?!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Just then,
Metal Mario finally came out of the building. He gave everyone a look
like he was too old for this nonsense and then went back inside.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Uh,
it&rsquo;s him. Yeah, he&rsquo;s the missing one,&rdquo; Dr. Toad
held a clipboard over his head to shield the rain. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">All
of you GET!&rdquo; Kylie growled, causing all of the staff to rush
back indoors.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Woman?!&rdquo;
James glared. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t pay us our overpriced service
fees yet!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">But Kylie
was already walking in the middle of the lane down the road, to the
displeasure of everyone.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Her
paycheck had better be worth it...&rdquo; James thought, losing his
patience with their employer.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Downstairs
Luigi saw that the stairway to the basement had the water reaching
the third stair from the top. Luigi had a flashlight, a tool belt and
two companions. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
peered into the water and couldn&rsquo;t see the bottom. &ldquo;Yikes!
This is b-b-bad.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">To
the bone.&rdquo; Daisy added, singing it like a lyric. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad dove
in first. His hyper ways and the third arm made him like a jet
turbine in the water. Luigi grabbed on for the ride with Daisy
grabbing him and completing the chain. The three zipped around
avoiding submerged linen, clothes, furniture, paintings, and more in
the darkness. Very quickly the flashlight shown upon the rusty metal
door of the drainage room, an area somewhat ingeniously built into
the castle that contained two pillars that if pressed, released all
water from the moat into a nearby lake. Luigi tried the handle to no
avail. He turned to his friends and did a shrugging motion while
holding his breath.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daisy
immediately pried away the metal door with her bare hands, pulling it
back like a sticker. Enamored Luigi almost missed dating her except
he didn&rsquo;t because he was actually kind of terrified. Luigi and
Toad were pushed into the room by water rushing in until Daisy closed
the door again, sealing them in. There was an another sealed door
leading out but other than that they had a breathable air bubble.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
illuminated the area with the flashlight. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I
brought you and not the others. None of us even almost drowned or got
hurt.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We'll
always have your back green!&rdquo; Daisy noticed the square stone
pillar that rise about six feet high. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been
down here. Can I do the honor y&rsquo;all?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Go
for it homegirl,&rdquo; the bespeckled castle adviser said stepping
closer to the base of a pillar where some kind of gravel crunched
under his feet. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hi
ya!!&rdquo; Daisy jumped high in the air and stretched her legs out
so she landed while doing a split on the switches. Rumbles came from
the floor, growing in intensity. Keen and alert, Luigi looked around
until the floor buckled under them and all of the shallow water in
the room, along with those little &lsquo;pebbles&rsquo; Toad stepped
on earlier went down the two inch crack. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad bent
down over it. &ldquo;Huh&hellip; That&rsquo;s not what was supposed
to-&ldquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That was
when an intense inferno shot up from the crack!</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadsworth
and his four passengers got warm reception from their friends and the
Koopalings (aside from the several of each group absent inexplicably)
as they came over the hill that was behind the castle. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
and the Princess and Mr. Toadsworth and Junior are back!&rdquo;
Toadette said, with most of the castles staff and party celebrating.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Don&rsquo;t
I get a welcoming party?&rdquo; Bowser crossed his arms. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Of
course Vater.&rdquo; Ludwig motioned for Iggy to come close. &ldquo;Do
not you have something for our dear King Dad?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy
snapped his finger. &ldquo;Oh yeah, I have a death machine- I mean
gift!&rdquo; Iggy put a Hawaiian flowery necklace over Bowser's head.
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
noticed the real feeling flowers. &ldquo;Hey, I like it!... Wait,
this ain&rsquo;t gonna slice my neck off is it??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They went
inside from the back entrance and explained the harrowing details of
what happened to Sarasaland. Peach nearly fainted at the reminder
that another black star was in the sky over the Mushroom Kingdom.
This called for yet another meeting between Bowser, Peach, and Mario
who spoke outside again, this time in the front. (Peach ignored the
pot holes amazingly.)</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So
how do we explain this to Daisy, wherever she is?&rdquo; Mario asked.
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach kept
their eyes down. &ldquo;Gently. She will likely want to return home.&rdquo;
</font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">How
do we know those vortexes don&rsquo;t return, princess?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
don&rsquo;t, plumber. Anyway, what about that cure stuff? My eldest
brat said they finished it and it&rsquo;s ready to go.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario made
sure his spare hat was on tightly, turning to Bowser. &ldquo;I almost
messed it all up back there with that super scope stunt and so now I
have to follow though doing the right thing. Whatever happens happens
afterward.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
crossed his arms. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s stupid, suicidal, moronic, and
did I mention stupid? But ya know what? I don&rsquo;t care about all
this &lsquo;right thang&rsquo; stuff but you&rsquo;ll probably need
my help to not muck it up so I&rsquo;m in.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
patted the tears on her face with a cloth. &ldquo;You are right, no
matter what tragedy befalls the stars are guiding us&hellip; Even if
I do sense a bit of disturbance in them today.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
stretched his leg that gotten restless on the way back. &ldquo;Stop
that crying! It ain&rsquo;t a good look for ya, hotness. On the
bright side, you left the castle all day and it&rsquo;s still in one
piece-&ldquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">In a roar
a metric ton of the freshwater shot up like a tidal wave from the
moat and splashed over on everyone, quickly flooding the land. Yoshi
had become the Dr. Toadley&rsquo;s next bomb hunting partner after he
discovered that the odd pebbles scattered about were bombs. He was at
the property line of the castle and Royal Raceway a few miles away
and felt the explosion. Yoshi ran back to assist but Dr. Toadley
stayed put dropped the shovel in regret. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Did
I an idiot for not checking for mines inside the castle? Yes I am!&rdquo;
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Back at
the castle&hellip;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser,
Mario, and Peach hung for their lives in a tree. Water filled with
loose debris rapidly flow just inches under their feet and mist
filled the air. Everyone was displaced in the flood water and there
were screams coming from in the castle. Bowser turned to Peach as he
thought of something.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah,
your castle is now screwed, but my airship&rsquo;s alright over there
floating. Looks like a success to me.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
punched Bowser in the princess&rsquo;s behalf.</font></p>

Kylie? She didn&rsquo;t pick up.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daffodil
rolled her eyes. &ldquo;Forget her, plus we&rsquo;re losing daylight.
We need to get to the South.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
troublesome four were cruising out in Lakitu's fluffy cloud kart when
they bypassed a Boo near a stop sign who seemed really familiar to
Emery for some reason. The little boo had a confident smile as their
eyes locked to hers. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Chomper
shook her shoulder. &ldquo;Watch yer self, lass!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The car
skid into a thin telephone pole on the edge of the street that
snapped and fell towards them. Inches away from the screaming
passengers, it became transparent and the log phased through them to
hit the road where it became solid again. Their hero and protector
was right at the driver side. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Don&rsquo;t
bat an eyelid, babe,&rdquo; the boo said.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Emery
smiled gratefully. &ldquo;Thank you!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daffodil
nodded. &ldquo;Come with us pal. We owe ya one and we&rsquo;re going
to the hospital to have some, uh, fun.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo smiled
cooly. &ldquo;I could be of use there.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They were
traveling again though the busted up, worn, and gang infested Toad
Town someone ran up to their car.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Emery,
what are you doing here?&rdquo; Geno asked, running along side them
comically. &ldquo;And have you seen Kylie?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;&#9825;&#9834;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">!?
, I can&rsquo;t help you. She went all bipolar on me and ran off.&rdquo;
Emery shrugged, being egged on by her friends except Booigi, who only
observed. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Geno was
left in the dust, panting. He knew why everyone on Earth was acting
strange, but he had no idea what to do about it. He hoped Kylie would
be more level headed once he finally located her.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Located
outside of Toad Town, the orange evening sun was low and the weather
clear. A silver Aston Mushroom, riddled with bullet sized dents, no
driver&rsquo;s window, one flat tire, and leaking oil, coast to a
stop in an open green field. On the dash was every error alert ever.
Bond got out and took a look around. Zoo got off afterwards and thew
his burger wrapper in the back seat.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">This
reminds me of being a teen at a community camp,&rdquo; Zoo grumbled,
shielding his eyes from the sun.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond
waited for him to catch up. &ldquo;Me too.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Where
were you sent? Rich camp?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Quite
the opposite. You know, there is still a walk to the village so if
you leave now, your parents might not spot you and bake cookies for
your arrival,&rdquo; he teased.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Vacantly
Zoo stared straight ahead until he felt Bond&rsquo;s arm around him.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
am sorry. I didn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo shoved
him back. &ldquo;What are you doing touching me??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
were crying.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Silence,
aside from the rustles of grass and very distant birds. Zoo was about
to reply sharply but he couldn&rsquo;t ignore the tears involuntarily
running down his face. Caught between embarrassment and anger he
prepared to run before Bond clipped his glasses on his shirt. Though
Zoo never noticed back at Special World, he could now clearly see
Bond&rsquo;s beady but grey and cloudy eyes.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Believe
me when I say I understand. Your upbringing was rough, so was mine. I
was given up for adoption and lived in camps until I was eighteen. My
&lsquo;fancy&rsquo; things, the car, the watch, the shirts, all come
from work. I do not even own a house, I live with Jeremy, erm
nevermind. Either way, I had no right to joke like that. Do you want
to leave?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo wiped
his nose with his head turned, tying to play it off cool to the very
end. &ldquo;I call the car. Or not.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The car a
quarter a mile away was smoking from the hood. If Bond hadn&rsquo;t
placated Zoo so much the noki would be dead by now except- No one
ever calmed Zoo down... Even his brother Drew knew to simply not make
him mad in the first place. What gave this dude he&rsquo;d met today
that privilege? He had to know more about him.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">New
plan.&rdquo; Zoo held out one arm threateningly. &ldquo;Teach me that
rick Mitch did to me last light and I won&rsquo;t turn you into swiss
cheese.&rdquo; Zoo had to be in control of this situation, even if it
mean sticking around. Since this entire mess started he&rsquo;d felt
like some force was nudging him down a path in life and he hated it,
so was this mysterious guy really an ally? He glared at this short
Hawaiian shirt noki freak who was.. decently pleasant to him always.
And spoke to him like a person. And was generous. And other things,
Zoo noticed the more he thought about it, so he cut that out quick.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Unperturbed,
Bond went a few feet down the dirt road. &ldquo;I would have shown
you anyway.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo pushed
him along. &ldquo;Yeah, yeah just do it!&rdquo;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dark Ztar
switched his 50&rdquo; smart tv over to what was happening on Nebula
9, chuckling at normally pacifist Z3ns and T4ien alien races driven
to annihilate each other due to believing one planet canceled the
other&rsquo;s Super Bowl. Now aliens were using their prayer bells to
bludgeon each other and their damaru to beat while marching to
warfare. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With a
yawn Dark Ztar checked his phone. Or right! Busted! Capital!</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
reminded him. Star warriors were such punks these days, running
dragging memories he wished to bury with their stories of dark stars.
Nonetheless, there was little else to do but drag himself to that
terrestrial planet to only further convince himself that it was
rubbish.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He first
visited Toad Town, the so called capital of the Mushroom Kingdom.
Bands of sailors at the boarders were charging double to ship
families and throwing overboard anyone that snuck on. The citizens in
the main lands were deserted and only ruffian looking people roamed
the streets. The south was having internal struggles dealing with
their crazy Mushroom Flu patients. Boring.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dark Ztar
was just about to leave when he heard a soft voice calling him to the
East. Visiting Sarasaland he saw fighting, strife, missing persons,
and devastation; some sort of grand disaster struck. He even sensed
residual dark matter in the atmosphere from another dark star like
him. A name flashed in his mind, but no, this wasn&rsquo;t their
style. It must be someone else.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Good
show, Mr. Destoryer of Worlds. Good show!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
kneweth thee would notice, Zach. Methinks about thee always&hellip;&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dark Ztar
froze at seeing the visitor. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Dark Ztar now.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Aww,
that&rsquo;s so cute, Zachy!&rdquo; She poked him teasingly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dark Ztar
made a face. &ldquo;Stop it! Stop it!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Loosen
up. How do you like my work? Totally awesome right?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dark Ztar
pushed his monocle up, humming. &ldquo;Forgive me love for not
recognizing it sooner, but you&rsquo;ve pulled no such stunts since a
millennium ago. How did you do it?&rdquo; He attentively listened to
the plain and dark star before him wearing only a bowler hat. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She stared
at him funny. &ldquo;I did something like this just the other day,
silly!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dark Ztar
paused. &ldquo;Look at me. Did I have this then?&rdquo; He stroked
his luxurious black goatee.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">But..but..&rdquo;
She spun around to look at the world below, noting for the first time
all of the electricity, modern plumbing, and cellphones. &ldquo;What
year is this?!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Erm&hellip;
two thousand something in Earth years-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">TWO
THOUSAND? YEARS CAN GO THAT HIGH?!&rdquo; She rose up and down in the
air, freaking out. &ldquo;You know, when they the banished me to this
planet I found a host with special abilities. He could tap into dark
matter and using him so I blew this lame dusty place off the map, but
he wised up and then&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s confusing.
I just know he died but not before he passed me on. I knew I might
get stuck with ordinary people for a while, cause that makes me
inanimate basically, but I never knew it&rsquo;d be this long!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dark Ztar
nodded at her plight. &ldquo;Tough, love. Who&rsquo;s the bloke
you&rsquo;re attached to now?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
thought for a moment. &ldquo;Ummmmm. There&rsquo;s this boo named X
or Y or Z or something and he must have been special because I woke
up the moment he owned me but he was weak then. Next I know I wake up
again and I&rsquo;m just as strong as I was with that original guy.
What should I do? Did anything exciting happen?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
have internet now but that&rsquo;s about all that&rsquo;s important.
Since this insignificant planet is your oyster now it is entirely up
to you,&rdquo; Dark Ztar said, all dignified like. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So
I should destroy it anyway? I like that plan!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">..If
you say so.&rdquo; Dark Ztar began to leave.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wait,
where are you going??&rdquo; she asked the fleeting star. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
been tempting high profile people to get destroyed by my portals,
like old times. Don&rsquo;t you care?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dear,
I haven&rsquo;t cared since the great heroes of year 44 BCE. Your
homages are charming and all, but wasting time with Earth means
nothing to me. Nothing!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Her
features contort into a scowl as she rushed him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
also trying to get rid of my host like before. When that boo is dead
I&rsquo;ll be free.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dark Ztar
spun around, smirking. &ldquo;But you are still banished here, Ms.
Bellstar Doomella. Farewell.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
punk!&rdquo; Doomella screamed after him, shooting daggers at him all
the way until he left Earth. Moments later Dark Ztar would return to
his layer and set back on his couch, feeling a crunch.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bloody
capital!&rdquo; His voice resounded bitterly throughout his abode as
he held his even more broken cellphone. At least it was still powered
on and recording.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie,
with toilet tissue wrapped around her head and arms like a sort of
mummy approached the front desk. The entire airport was deserted and
it continued to storm outside.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;m
biting the dust soon, brother. That&rsquo;s why I need five doctors
with me everywhere I go. Got something for Toad Town for six?&rdquo;
She pointed with her thumb to the MKDCU behind her standing around at
a distance, adding credibility.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The toad
checked the schedule. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a flight out of Special
World to the Mushroom Kingdom in about two more hours.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Too
more hours?!&rdquo; Kylie was fixated on the video screen above that
showed a different story.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Let
me get a manager.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A moment
later a large red bird came to the window, suited in tie, and already
impatiently watching the digital clock. &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am? Did
you have a concern?</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
leaned in. &ldquo;Mr. Albatoss, it&rsquo;s Kylie, ace reporter. You
were just the front desk guy when Mitch and I wrote that article. You
know, the one that made the entire airline close over those tainted
peanuts?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mr.
Albatoss&rsquo;s mouth hung open for a moment. &ldquo;I remember
that, yes?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Words
have power, brother. It wouldn&rsquo;t look too good if you didn&rsquo;t
let me see my loved ones before I leave this world&hellip;&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mr.
Albatoss cleared his throat. &ldquo;Uh, maybe we can do something.
What do you have?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Nothing
that&rsquo;s a travel risk. Just, er, Mushroom Flu. Now I need a one
way for six. You feel me?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mr.
Albatoss nodded briskly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Moments
later the MKDCU rushed inside the ratty economy class passenger
plane, illegally they were sure. They hadn&rsquo;t found seats when
the plane was already lifting from the ground. Sebastian found his
seat mysteriously moist, Richard had a spring stick him in the butt,
Wiggletron&rsquo;s head smacked the overhead luggage department, and
James sat down to in someone&rsquo;s lap. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Richard
rolled him off onto the dirty floors. &ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t this
crappy airplane&rsquo;s fault. You&rsquo;re just blind!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Meanwhile,
Kylie foot hopped in the plush leather seats when Parabilly found her
in the sparsely filled first class area.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You&rsquo;d
better hope we don&rsquo;t get caught blackmail&rsquo;n,&rdquo; he
said quietly, but seriously. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you&rsquo;re
doing all his costuming and fibbin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
needed to get back in town quickly.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He bent
down to her level. &ldquo;Talk to me, koopa to koopa. I know we&rsquo;re
hardly familiar, but you just ain&rsquo;t the same from yesterday.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
didn&rsquo;t even face him. &ldquo;I have to destroy Zoo. It&rsquo;s
all I can think about...&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
rushed the agents out the moment they landed, barging past anyone
else. It was pouring down when Kylie saw a shiny new taxi that was
parked in front of the airport.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Cover
me, ya&rsquo;ll!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And the
MKDCU did so, huddling up around to escort her to the cab which she
jumped in.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Richard&rsquo;s
face pressed up against the glass. &ldquo;This yours?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Now
it is, brother.&rdquo; To Kylie&rsquo;s mild dismay, the MKDCU took
that response at face value, joining her inside the car. She put
qualms aside and sped off while the actual cabby, a goomba who wore a
neck brace, had burn marks on him, patches under his eyes, and
incidentally not much change in his pocket, ran after them yelling
before giving up shortly.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
quit! I don&rsquo;t care what the statistics say, Bowser&rsquo;s army
has to be better than this!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With
another wild rushed ride, Kylie stopped in front of a regular house
in East Toad Town. It was so boring that it hadn&rsquo;t even been
raided by a gang, and all around was eerily deserted, left behind by
the blue clad gang that got dissolved as soon as it start. Kylie
jumped out without an explanation and went in.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There was
only a toy box in the room to anyone not in the know. What Kylie knew
however was that this was a secret passage to Shy Guy&rsquo;s Toybox,
which was another cover up for the secret spy headquarters guarded by
Spy Guy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
clapped three times. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Password?&rdquo;
a little voice asked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Outside
the MKDCU waited for a few minutes before they sent Sebastian inside.
He came out empty handed.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There&rsquo;s
no other doors in there so she just disappeared!&rdquo; the snifit
informed his squad.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
used the abysmal window light to see her clipboard. She was on the
inside deck of Bowser&rsquo;s Doomship with across from her
Toadsworth sleep. Everyone in the corner of her eye she could see
some unsightly wanted posters of who was apparently an ex garbage
collector of Bowser&rsquo;s, Zoo Diddley. That was the criminal that
had poisoned Ludwig's mind, though thinking critically as she always
did, wasn't Ludwig still responsible to an extent? She guessed the
military commander being their only hope for a cure canceled it out.
It was weird how that worked. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Okay, roll
call time: Alagold and Thomas were playing some kind of card game.
Wendy was setting around listening to music on her phone and Larry
was on a laptop.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Out loud
she continued, &ldquo;Mario, the Princess, Mr. Toadsworth, Bowser,
Junior, Ludwig, Iggy, Wendy, Roy, Larry, Gold, you, I, and Dr.
Toadley&rsquo;s intern are on board. Russ T. was the only other staff
other than Thomas working today but Mr. Toad told me he retired. Talk
about great timing.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So
we&rsquo;re missing a lot of people.&rdquo; Buckenberry sat a plate
with a sandwich on in front of her. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s that snack by
the way.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She took a
bite. &ldquo;Mmm! What is it?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peanut
butter and toe jam.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
began to gag. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">On the top
deck:</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig was
at the helm with Mario and Bowser. After the watery explosion, the
entire area flooded with some of it shorting out the controls. Most
made it on board anyway, but they were stuck with the old school
method in their attempt to rescue Yoshi stranded on the castle&rsquo;s
roof and anyone else missing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach, who
was surprising many with her eagerness to help despite her home being
destroyed, held her parasol while pointing to Roy on starboard side.
Roy pulled his ore really hard to try to show off, but instead it
slipped out of his hand to plummet into the water. With a sigh, she
turned to port side where Iggy and a mechakoopa held ores. Instead of
row with Iggy, the mechakoopa spat a ten foot long trail of fire down
the side of the boat, scorching it black.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
no!&rdquo; Peach exclaimed.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Nah,
it&rsquo;s alright hotness. Our airships are heat resistant...&rdquo;
Bowser began to smile. &ldquo;Though with you around it is getting a
little warm here, heh heh...&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach&rsquo;s
lip curled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going downstairs.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Now
I don&rsquo;t feel so bad about when I scare chicks away,&rdquo; Iggy
giggled. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
shifted uncomfortably in place at the change of topic. &ldquo;Iggy,
lend me the battery from that mechakoopa, will you?&rdquo; he asked,
opening a control panel with lot of wires popping out of it.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Need
help? I was an electrician before.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
step aside and let Mario crouch down. &ldquo;Be my guest plumber, but
do be wary of-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">When Mario
touched the wrong wire, bolts of electricity ripped through his
veins, shocking him in place with bulging eyes. On reflex Bowser
tried pull him away but the electricity spread to him, shocking him
with a particularly goofy expression. Dr. Toadley&rsquo;s intern ran
over to strategically pulled them both off to sizzle on the deck.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Clear!
I came up here just to do that.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thanks
I guess,&rdquo; Iggy told her. &ldquo;Now what?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;ll
show up when I&rsquo;m needed again.&rdquo; Mary slowly backpedaled
to leave the scene, just knowing she&rsquo;d be important again
later. Roy left too, not because he was important, but because he was
lazy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
stood over his dad and shook him gently. &ldquo;Vater? Are you
okay??&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
rubbed his head. &ldquo;Mario?&rdquo; he said groggily. &ldquo;I knew
you&rsquo;d be best man in the wedding...&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
laughed dryly. &ldquo;He seems normal.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There
was a reason why I quit that job real quick,&rdquo; Mario moaned. &ldquo;At
least I see blinking lights again.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
flipped a switch on the navigation panel. &ldquo;Systems are on at
60%. Awaiting farther instructions.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
jumped up. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s some. Turn this blasted thing around
already! Some of my kids could be inside!&rdquo; Bowser pulled the
wheel hard. The battle cruiser took a deep turn to the right, making
everyone get pressed into the rails as they sped towards Peach&rsquo;s
flooded castle. They crashed, shattering the stained glass mosaic of
Peach and exposing the third floor. Lemmy looked up from the &lsquo;SOS&rsquo;
he&rsquo;d made with crayons and Morton dropped the pocket thesaurus.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We&rsquo;re
saved!&rdquo; Lemmy cried as he boarded the ship.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
were left in the lurch, stranded, alone, but now we are rejoiced,
happy, ecstatic!&rdquo; Morton jumped on as well. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Keep
that boat right there, homeboys!&rdquo; Toad came around the corner
with Luigi and Daisy. They were dripping wet and covered in some kind
of dusty powder. A hole in the floor was near them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
shook water out of his ear once he got on board. &ldquo;Sorry we
missed the welcoming party. We were draining the moat when some
landmines exploded or something under the castle. The geyser shot us
up into the clouds&hellip;. And then we landed again.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
Green said. We fell fifty feet, but we&rsquo;re alright.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daisy?
We&rsquo;re over here,&rdquo; Toad said.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daisy spun
around to face everyone, wobbling a bit with her balance. &ldquo;Oh,
yeah, I knew that. Say, since when did you all have twins?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Where&rsquo;s
Stan?&rdquo; Luigi asked. He made the long jump back into the castle
appearing again a moment later to help support Captain Toad who held
to the side of his face a clothe stained deep red. Even with the down
pour, everyone could see his deathly parlor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Also white
in the face, Lemmy cleared his throat. &ldquo;I-it was a zapper
accident.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It..
really.. was...sir..&rdquo; Captain Toad confirmed.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Indeed!
He was showing us a trick, a technique, a wonder! But then it went
off right next to his face!&rdquo; Morton added.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Both
of you, downstairs,&rdquo; Bowser motioned to Wendy, who had joined
the wet and (mostly) living on the top deck with a phone firmly
planted in her hands, protected by a sandwich baggy of course. &ldquo;Take
Fungus Face&rsquo;s look a like to the ER.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
have that?&rdquo; Mario asked skeptically.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
kept silent, grinning in a way to suggest that the &lsquo;ER&rsquo;
wasn&rsquo;t really an ER.<br/>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re just missing
dinosaur breath, right? Come on down!&rdquo; Bowser yelled upwards at
the dinosaur that was hesitant to jump.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hold
on! I&rsquo;m about to shoot stuff.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
whipped around to Junior, who&rsquo;d been silently manning a cannon
on the surface of the ship the entire time waiting for a chance to
shoot it. He lit the cannon and with a boom a large iron ball shot
towards the spire Yoshi was on. The dinosaur dodged out of the way
just in time and with an explosion behind him, Yoshi flailed in the
air and landed flat on the deck of the ship.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Junior!!&rdquo;
</font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Y-yes

CAN GET BURNED AND HURT VERY VERY BADLY!&rdquo; </font>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;m
sorry daddy!!&rdquo; Junior ran, sobbing downstairs.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
else did we miss, Mario?&rdquo; Daisy asked the rigging. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;m
over here Daisy. Also, I need to tell you something important.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah,
I know. Chai Kingdom got attacked,&rdquo; she said matter of factly.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">How
did you know?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
special alien brain wave technology we have hidden under our
pyramids.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daisy,&rdquo;
Mario said carefully. &ldquo;Are you sure you&rsquo;re feeling okay?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
yawned. &ldquo;Leave flower chick alone. So you don&rsquo;t care that
we curb stomped your lame generals, trashed your armies, probably
burnt down part of your castle, and then a portal showed up?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daisy&rsquo;s
jaw was clinched in repressed emotion. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any
family that still lived around there, but those generals were like my
uncles, don&rsquo;t push it.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
backed off, softening a bit. &ldquo;Sorry, flower chick, or Daisy I
mean. Didn&rsquo;t mean it like that.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah,
he didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Mario added. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s even sorry he
stepped on your Xbox on our way out.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She froze.
&ldquo;WHAT?!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr.
Toadley relaxed on an inflatable like on gentle waters at a beach.
Except that was the opposite happening...</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Grab
on, doc!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
waved to him from the rail of the rescue ship and Ludwig dropped down
a rope ladder for him to climb. On board Dr. Toadley ignored Bowser
who looked like someone had recently punched him in the face, and
walked around Yoshi&rsquo;s body still laying on the deck. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thank
you for the rescue. Did I find 100 mines? Yes I did.&rdquo; He lifted
his cloak where his undershirt had a bulging pocket.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Do
keep those in your pocket,&rdquo; Ludwig hissed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Up ahead,
Mario saw very faintly in their path a purple glowing star floating
below the clouds...</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The was
stormy enough outside for Dr. Toad to hear the thunder even from his
office. Before him, spread all over his scratched up desk were result
papers from all of the testing on their ten patients. Electrotherapy,
using gases, brain scans? Every single one was a failure. He let his
head drop down on the desk as he felt all of his hopes slip away,
finally clicking his buzzer that he&rsquo;d been ignoring.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Is
this Dr. Toad?!&rdquo; replied an angry sounding associate. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
been asking ya to join us in the board room forever. Say something!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Why did
they have to be so loud? &ldquo;Something. Now associate, you do NOT
have to pester me constantly.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
ain&rsquo;t a doctor! If you don&rsquo;t get over here I&rsquo;ll
knock that door down and drag you!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
blinked twice and then obeyed. Waiting in the board room where the
other three he&rsquo;d assembled for the team, Morris, Dr. Topper,
and Dr. Goom, plus Metal Mario, all looking either tired or
disgruntled.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
took a seat at the end of the glass table. &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A goomba
doctor clicked a remote and the monitor behind Dr. Toad cut on. &ldquo;Do
you see that sir? I think it is time to let our Case X patients go.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
turned around to see the news report that described Toad Town as a
&lsquo;wasteland&rsquo; over run by gangs.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">If
we keep them we might get into trouble your Masterplan card can&rsquo;t
get us out of. Besides, I&rsquo;m tired to getting hurt, my dear
fellow.&rdquo; Morris&rsquo;s left arm was in a sling. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
turned back to his associates, frowning. &ldquo;We have made no
progress.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Goom
nodded. &ldquo;I would have liked to have seen something happen
myself, but don&rsquo;t you think these aren&rsquo;t the best
circumstances to keep pressing on? If a local cure is developed sir,
it is not likely to make it here.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Are
you all suggesting we quit??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Topper
got up from his seat. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk about it.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
shot up as well. &ldquo;No! How can you even?-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">If
the pipsqueak has his own little plans, let em do it!&rdquo; Metal
Mario said, keeping himself in the dark back corner of the room with
his arms crossed. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Shut
up!&rdquo; Dr. Toad spat.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Goom
sighed. &ldquo;Sir, you are being quite irrational.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;d
expect it from a wimp.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Who
let him that metallic fellow in here? He scares me,&rdquo; Morris
whispered.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
yanked the cord from the monitor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lose my father
forever if we can&rsquo;t figure out how Mushroom Flu affects the
brain!&rdquo; he blurt out before realizing what he was admitting.
Everyone in the room, even Metal Mario stared.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Drew,
why didn&rsquo;t you tell us that?&rdquo; Dr. Topper asked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
sat back down defeated. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t discuss them because
they&rsquo;re&hellip; they&rsquo;re boos. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m
a &lsquo;Diddley&rsquo;. If people knew this sort of thing, that I
grew up on circus grounds, in forests, not even in the Mushroom
Kingdom, I&rsquo;d never gotten where I am now&hellip;&rdquo; he
explained in between sobbing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m losing Lou to
dementia. He could hardly hold a conversation on the phone and when I
saw him in person, he didn&rsquo;t even recognize me.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Next Dr.
Toad knew, everyone was up from their seats and standing around him.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Fellow,
there are many mad experiments that we can conduct to help with
that.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
don&rsquo;t know about &lsquo;mad&rsquo; experiments Morris, but
that&rsquo;s definitely something I&rsquo;d vote for if you put it up
on the suggestion board,&rdquo; Dr. Topper said with a smile.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Goom
nodded. &ldquo;I would like to assist. After all sir, every other
associate in his hospital other than that giant goose is unnamed and
unreliable.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Metal
Mario shrugged. &ldquo;Sorry kid. That&rsquo;s all I can say.&rdquo;
Then the metallic clone gave a start at the set of keys Dr. Toad
produced from his coat pocket.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Listen.
Just&hellip; take them back. This goes to our helicopter.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Heck
yeah!&rdquo; Metal Mario cheered before he caught himself. He grunted
and put the keys in a pocket, attempting to be edgy again.</font></p>

Bond glance to his left. The distance from the military grade
aircraft to his target were thousands of feet. The young rookie&rsquo;s
heart beat out of his chest, but the last thing he needed was a bad
mark on his test. The lovely Maria dressed so elegantly was beside
him, going next. The early comrade at Super Spy Headquarters who
could speak to him in his mother language and always cheered him on
was eventually his first swing...</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And so Zoo
did so at request of his impatient family, as it was starting to get
dark. Zoo hit the pink colored golf ball shot into a fake rock that
bounced it into the water hazard. Drew told him his high score which
was actually quite bad considering golf. Zoo threw the putter to the
ground. This was one of the few times his family visited some out of
town attraction, and it sucked. Mini Golf Fun Land of Chocolate
Island? If they wanted Zoo to return, they&rsquo;d have to-</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Drag

Bond was dropped roughly in the alley and flogged by the criminal's
masked mooks. He would have never gotten captured if he hadn&rsquo;t
refused the suggested &lsquo;run and gun&rsquo; tactic, but he was
never much of a fighter and he knew the hearts of most were innocent.
His backup would arrive any minute, and while he wasn&rsquo;t a too
close to the thromp, Agent 999 could defuse a mean bomb. Even a
furious one. Either way after a little more endurance the drug cartel
leader bob-omb before him and his cohorts would never again be able
to plan a-</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bank
Heist. Zoo read all about it while setting in his dark apartment with
no lights or water. He was in an unemployed gap, a dangerous one,
because that meant he got bored often. Maybe he&rsquo;d try to crash
with his brother yet again, but Zoo&rsquo;s phone was also out so how
would he call for a ride? Night night skyline of Toad Town was black,
sprinkled with many lights below. Zoo thought it fruitless but said
out loud anyway &lsquo;Dear-</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Eldstar,
could you have possibly picked a better time?!&rdquo; Agent N fussed
as he shaved in the bathroom. The half suited Yoshi deep was in
paperwork even while home and off the clock, trying in vain to clear
up complications caused by other ragtag agents. Bond waiting outside
the door was not deterred, the Sprixies couldn&rsquo;t wait any
longer. This would be the first time he went on a mission without the
forms he needed to make it official and far from the last&hellip;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo nodded
without knowing what he was agreeing to, the brisk game of
&lsquo;psychopath&rsquo; they played during the walk leaving him in a
daze. The guard let them in and soon they were walking among small
cabins. Zoo wasn&rsquo;t sure what to think about the noki or why
he&rsquo;d stick with him anyway. He guessed a part of him was
actually curious about if his parents were as bad as Drew warned.
Another part, didn&rsquo;t have anything else better to do. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond
stopped just short of Zoo&rsquo;s parents porch. &ldquo;Did you say
something, mon ami?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo stared
blankly. &ldquo;N-no.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond
knocked on the door. It swung open and a white boo jumped out.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
don&rsquo;t do autographs!!&rdquo; he screamed, shaking violently
with popping veins visible even under his blindfold.
Hyperventilating, he bared his sharp teeth like a rabid animal before
being grabbed back by another boo, this time a pink one. She gasp
when she saw her son and shut the door. Zoo had almost forgotten how
his mother sounded. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Let
me try to speak to them.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond
entered the cabin while Zoo spied in from the dirty window. The house
was barren, even to someone who was familiar with Dark Land&rsquo;s
pathetic excuse for public housing. Lou was on ratty mats asleep as
if his conniption one minute ago never happened. His mother was near
Bond in the middle of the room, worn down with heavy lives gracing
her once completely smooth skin. The other corner had an old looking
stove with a bubbling pot on it. The last item in the entire one room
cabin was a wooden chest, the same one his father had when he was a
child. Seeing it again was surreal. For a moment to be replace by an
intense anger bubbling up.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
wandered off in the wooded community in circles until a monty mole
exited a cabin and made the mistake of crossing his path on a motor
bike. Without thinking, Zoo sent his death ray forth. The mole
tumbled over with a yelp before Zoo caught himself and ceased the
attack. He watched the small mammal on the ground for a moment,
hoping he was still alive. Zoo approached hesitantly..</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bro,
you&rsquo;re alright?&rdquo; he asked, trying to sound as innocent as
possible. The mole shook their head and crawled back towards their
house, leaving the bike. Zoo was about to pursue until an all black
cruiser speed down the road and skid before his parents house. Two
guys stormed through the doors yelling. One second later, Bond was
dragged out and stuffed in the car&rsquo;s truck. Zoo rushed back to
the house before the exhaust fumes had cleared.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Who
the heck were those guys?!&rdquo; Zoo asked his mother standing in
the door.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sue
retreat in the house.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No
no no!&rdquo; He shout at the closed door. He could ram the door down
and make her speak if he wanted to but&hellip; He took a deep breath.
He was free but why couldn&rsquo;t he let Bond go? &ldquo;Please Sue.
Or, mom. Whatever. That guy was uh, a friend. I need to know what&rsquo;s
going on. What were you talking about in there?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The door
cracked open. Zoo entered to see her motioning towards the box.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With his
father snoring in the background he rummaged through it to find
familiar contents: Some rocks known to be ancient and some kind of
alien looking scrap metal. All of these artifacts came from space&hellip;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo ran
out and grabbed the discarded bike from the monty mole, following the
direction the car went.</font></p>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daisy&rsquo;s
slowly lifted her head up. &ldquo;My &lsquo;Unreal Championship 2&rsquo;
high scores are gone! Forever!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
sounds like that sucks,&rdquo; Toad said, not really sure what he was
agreeing to.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
Junior, in great pain, (emotional at least) polished a cannon very
loudly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry again.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi, the
last of the sick with an ice pack on his head, looked at the koopa
child with annoyance, shrugging in a way to suggest that Junior was
just eating out Peach&rsquo;s refrigerator before the castle
exploded.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Don't
silently yell at me!&quot; Junior screeched. &quot;I'm still
traumatized by King Dad yelling at me!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">BOOM.
Everyone felt a beat to the chest. In the rear of the ship, there was
now a gaping hole leading hundreds of feet to the ground!</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Junior&rsquo;s
hands shot in the air. &quot;Wasn't me!!!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Morton
sniffed around. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s cooking? Sizzling? Grilling? Me!
AHHH!&rdquo; Morton ran around with his tail on fire, inadvertently
spreading it to the wooden furnishing.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Stop
that!!&rdquo; Luigi tried to yell among the panic as the ship began
to get pelted with projectiles. Everyone zipped around wildly,
knocking things over, stepping on toes, and kind of hurting
themselves before the enemies on the ground got a chance to.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Though all
of this Captain Toad weakly grabbed Toad&rsquo;s shirt, catching the
castle adviser off guard. &quot;Sir, I- I have a confession...&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Upstairs,
Mario peeked over the rails to find that they passed over Baddie
stations and abandoned houses equipped with bill blasters and cannons
galore. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Everyone
strap in!&rdquo; Bowser bellowed into a radio. He kicked the airship
into the highest gear it had. The baddies below saw their target
escaping and fired their biggest weapon. A six hundred pound bullet
shaped torpedo tore through the sky. Mario was knocked off his feet
by the crash just in time to get trampled by almost a large group
covered in black soot rushing up to the top deck.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Do
you have another plan?!&rdquo; Peach, who was anything but that color
now, plead.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">SHUT
UP! EVERYBODY SHUT UP!&hellip; If the Koopa Troop gave up this easy
our names wouldn&rsquo;t be in record books, we wouldn&rsquo;t have
made it past the first videogame, and we wouldn&rsquo;t have decided
to help you Mario losers out. Now strap your boots on. You&rsquo;re
all enlisted in my army now and the first order is!&rdquo; Bowser
realized how quickly they were losing altitude and his gameface
waned. &ldquo;Erm&hellip;&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Plead
to a star of your choice!&rdquo; Mary said.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
slapped his face. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got nothing better. Do it!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
joined in arms with several others, his brother, the princesses, and
almost all the toads. &ldquo;Dear Eldstar, we&rsquo;re in your
hands.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi was
off alone when he bent his head. &ldquo;Eldstar, if I survive and get
my voice back, I&rsquo;ll finally retire like I should have long
ago.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr.
Toadley grabbed Mary&rsquo;s hands. &ldquo;Should you save us right
now? Yes you should. Amen?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yes?&rdquo;
she answered.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Was
that a question? No it was not.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
didn&rsquo;t have a good relationship with the stars after that whole
stealing Star Rod incident so he told Ludwig to represent the family.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
bowed his head. &ldquo;Dear stars above, that is right, all of you. I
know you are there so help us, or else!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ho
ho ho! I had fallen asleep earlier, sorry.&rdquo; Everyone held their
breaths as a purple star materialized above their heads, the one
Mario thought he saw earlier. &ldquo;I am Millennium Star, and I know
exactly what is going on. You have shown the wit, kindness, strength,
love, courage, beauty, and mischief needed to become Super Stars, but
there can only be one winner!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Everyone
stared blankly.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">..Never
mind,&rdquo; Millennium Star said casually. &ldquo;My friend Game Guy
told me about the portal issue, so how about you help me conceal my
identity until that army of lumas stop searching for me and I&rsquo;ll
help you all avoid meeting our demise in a fiery explosion. Deal?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Not
waiting for a response, brilliant light emitted from the star as it
became the figurehead of the airship, repairing the boat, and making
everything turn rainbow sparkly colors like a super star. The effects
spread to everyone on the boat, making them flash and glow, and
reinvigorating all of their senses.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A deep
voice came out of nowhere as the airship began to lift into the sky
once more. &ldquo;Carry on, Mario Party! You are now all &lsquo;Super
Stars&rsquo;!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
stared at his own glowing hands. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yo.
This is cool,&rdquo; Larry said. &ldquo;Wait, I can talk!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Me
too! Guys. I&rsquo;m retiring,&rdquo; Yoshi proudly said out of the
blue.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
want to as well. Someone hug me.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Superstar
Daisy and Toad ran over and hugged Superstar Luigi tightly. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
was actually me speaking,&rdquo; Buckenberry said dejectedly. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy put
an arm around him. &ldquo;Join the club.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Destroy
those losers,&rdquo; Bowser growled.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
koopalings and Junior rushed to the deck below them for war. Eight of
of the battle cruiser&rsquo;s cannons aimed in a downward direction
and obliterated the shacks with ease, creating huge explosions and
pillars of fire on land. With the ship in better shape then it was
when Bower flew it to the Mushroom Kingdom this morning, it got out
of the danger zone in a matter of minutes and like the fitting
conclusion of a great job solved only by love and team work, everyone
high five. Almost. (Peach still refused to touch Bowser.)</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo raced
down the road on the motor bike to a flat highway. His abducted
friend was only a mile away, the fleeing car restricted in it&rsquo;s
departure to the winding path. Zoo drove off road, roughly running
over rocks, shrubs, and plants. All he could focus on was that car
whose driver was an island variant boo with sunglasses. There was a
plump strollin&rsquo; stu dressed in tactical wear as the passenger.
The Stu agent pointed to him and then rolled down the window, firing
a tranquilizing gun. Zoo felt the prick but kept up with the speeding
car. He lifted an arm off the handlebars to focus on the Stu. When
the enemy raised the gun again it fell from his grip as he seized up,
red liquid dripping from their nose. First a drop or two, then a
steady drain a second later. The boo agent driving hardly had time
react before his eyes glazed over and he fell limply to the side,
making the car veer off road completely. Red dust was kicked up high
into the sky as they careened in a diagonal direction, finally
coasting to a stop in a small trench. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo opened
the driver's door. The boo agent was resting on the cup holder
occupied with Starman Bucks coffee, obviously his. Zoo hated hipster
mega corporations on principle so he threw the boo agent&rsquo;s body
out to the ground. Wait, that was random. The stu agent&rsquo;s once
yellow skin was white and consequently his green outfit dark red.
Nothing of use was on him, well, the gun might have been, but it
wasn&rsquo;t that effective judging by the fact that Zoo was still
standing. The dash board was cluttered and modified from normal with
various equipment and a hand written note that said: &lsquo;Charles,
you owe me five bucks or else. I know about your latest pet.&rsquo;
Zoo ignored that and finally located the switch to unlock the truck. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond
sprung out and took a defensive stance immediately. When he turned
around he froze at the sight. &ldquo;That was Agent M and 0088.
They&rsquo;re dead&hellip;&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...Well
sorry for flipping tying to save you! just I couldn&rsquo;t lose-! I
mean-&quot; Zoo cut himself short.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;They
were going push the car into the nearest lake. With me in it..&rdquo;
Bond explained with some rare malice in his tone. Bond dug into one
of his back teeth and chucked a very tiny device in the distance.
&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Don&rsquo;t
mention it, dude. Now what? We run?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Obviously,&rdquo;
Bond surprised him by saying. &ldquo;I was speaking to your mother
about the bell and it is from space. I hate to sound obsessed but we
cannot let this halt our investigation.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Talk
about bouncing back quick, does this guy just regularly escape
death?&rdquo; Zoo mused while Bond was emptying everything else in
the trunk. There were chains and weapons and junkfood. Zoo might have
gotten along with those two if they had a better introduction.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Quickly
now. You take Agent 0088.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo didn&rsquo;t
have to think about it. Er, he kind of was familiar with the stuffing
bodies in trunks thing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond
paused and glanced at him oddly. &ldquo;I am curious. What did you
want to be growing up?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
always wanted to perform,&rdquo; Zoo answered as he dragged the stu.
&ldquo;Comedy or acting with costumes. It just never worked out.. Oh,
and I like hurting people so that's kind of a problem for an aspiring
entertainer.&quot; Zoo felt more weightless than usual. Either the
tranquilizer was starting to work, or it was the fact that no one had
ever really asked him that. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
are under citizen arrest! I know your scheme with Zoo, a trusted
friend on Earth has told me all about you two!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">In an
instant the fog cleared away in Zoo&rsquo;s mind. They were in an
urbanized area, Mushroom City. In a familiar vehicle flipped to is
side from a nasty accident. People around ran and screamed as a short
person blue garb was shook their fists at Bond, who was pressed
against the window of a shop. Zoo crawled out of the wreckage and
tried to use his powers but there was nothing. This attacker had no
organic parts to target. As Zoo&rsquo;s jaw dropped, Geno made a tsk
noise and aimed his Star Rod towards him. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo saw
stars in every sense of the word.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Superstar
Mario was looking down from the rails on the newly repaired Doomship.
He felt a bit numb, maybe even insensitive that he was the only
person not buzzing with excitement, but someone had to keep calm.
Away from the baddie stations, Toad Town was empty again except for a
coasting taxi with sticky notes attached to the hood in the formation
of &lsquo;SOS&rsquo;. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Someone
handed Mario a telescope. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s MKDCU!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yo,
save us!! We&rsquo;re doctors!&rdquo; Richard yelled upwards.
&ldquo;Remember us? We got stood up and we just want a ride to the
south hospital!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
bent over the edge. &ldquo;How do you know they are hiring?!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We&rsquo;ll
volunteer!&rdquo; their leader James said. &ldquo;Working for our
normal over priced fee ain&rsquo;t worked all day or yesterday, so we
might as well do charity work!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Can
we really trust them?&rdquo; Peach whispered, also remembering from
yesterday.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
waved down. &ldquo;Wiggletron down there is an old buddy of mine.
Yeah.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Then
let em on, I guess. I could use more for my army.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
think not, Bowser,&rdquo; Peach said wryly. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
smiled her way. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make an exception for you,
hotness.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The ladder
was dropped, and the occupancy of the airship was added five more. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sebastian,
how&rsquo;d them posters of yers end up over yonder?&rdquo; Parabilly
asked once on board, eyeing wanted posters of a certain dark boo
garbage collector.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Those
originate from me. You would not be able to enlighten me would you?&rdquo;
Ludwig asked, his sixth sense of someone guilty coming to fruition.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The MKDCU
gulped collectively. &ldquo;Negative. Your captive has escaped our
vicinity,&rdquo; Wiggletron answered with a half truth.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Off from
where that was going on, Mario was standing around again aimlessly.
&ldquo;Thanks for that telescope. Whoever that was.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No
problem, Mario.&rdquo; Toad, his normal self now leaned on the
railing. &ldquo;Someone told me something before that close call we
had and I got me thinking. I interviewed a few of us just now and
there&rsquo;s a pattern,&rdquo; he mentioned in low voice.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
pattern of what?&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Of
a &lsquo;dark star&rsquo;! Homeboy, almost everyone had some sort of
run in with that symbol, or hearing voices, or something else freaky
today, including you! Remember what you told us?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
turned away from Toad&rsquo;s excitable face. &ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
okay?&rdquo; he inquired over his shoulder.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;m
in the same boat as everyone else,&rdquo; Mario answered vaguely,
going back to scouting out. Inside he was still empty and he needed
to fix that quick.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Halt!&rdquo;
the young koopa cowboy said to the approaching caravan. He and the
rest of the defense force guard the gate to Southern Mushroom
Kingdom, a sub region just south of Toad Town.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
no, he&rsquo;ll ruin our fun! Help us!&rdquo; Emery cowered behind
the wheel. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
hate people who make little girls cry...&rdquo; &lsquo;Booigi the
Second&rsquo; bounced on the koopa&rsquo;s head and sent his shell
flying towards his comrades. They all fell down into the soil, where
boo knocked them all out with a single slap. Booigi realized they
found the area familiar but it was like those memories were locked
away.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daffodil&rsquo;s
phone rang. After a conversation lasting ten seconds, she began to
bite her nails while handing the phone over to Chomper.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Aye?...
No, I sent the bikers before us.&rdquo; He gave Daffodil the phone
back. &ldquo;Nothing to fret over, lass. There&rsquo;s enough of us.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Booigi
wondered what that was about, but let it go. They drove on. Southern
Territory consisted of flat plains with the famous Mt. Rugged in the
background, partially obscured by low hanging rain clouds. The
Southern Hospital was near the foot of the mountain and there was a
little town set up near it with tents and other provisions for those
who had fled from Toad Town. Twelve loud bikers were also circling
the entire hospital.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Way
to go, laddies!&rdquo; Chomper told the bikers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo left
the car last, feeling a pit in their stomach. They followed in the
rear until they found a young koopa on the ground leaning against a
shed house. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Don&rsquo;t
try nothing!&rdquo; the shivering Jr. Troopa threatened as Boo pass.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What&rsquo;s
going on?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Pfft.
We&rsquo;re the only hospital open for miles and yet your terrorist
group is trying to take that!&rdquo; Troopa explain like it was
obvious.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Back with
the others, Emery was tagging along with a random biker while
Daffodil and the other two baddie leaders stood around under the
porch. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Okay,
I saw we just storm in and claim the place. This is a nice building
and supposedly they keep the refrigerators stocked with the good
stuff.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Nukem
nodded. &ldquo;I like the way you think, Dee.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Aye,
I call the Chuckola Cola.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daffodil
poked a finger at Chomper playfully. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t your doctor
warn about your liver?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Chomper
grinned. &ldquo;If anything happens at least I&rsquo;ll be in a
hospital already, lass.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Excuse
me.&rdquo; Booigi floated up to them slowly and deliberately. &ldquo;What
are you trying to do exactly?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daffodil
put a hand to her hip. &ldquo;What do you mean??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Don&rsquo;t
you know that dozens are sick inside?&rdquo; Booigi growled.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The three
played dumb. With another threatening rumble, Booigi pushed open the
doors to reveal what was going on inside the hospital. A group of
nurses and volunteers were holding back budging doors that went to
the east and west wings of the hospital.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jr. Troopa
hopped inside on crutches. &ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t good.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Mario
stepped away from the resistance force. &ldquo;Oh boy! This is some
strong Mushroom Flu if I&rsquo;ve ever seen it. They won&rsquo;t
respond to my vitamins, and they&rsquo;re coma walking strength is
twice as much as it should be. I wish Metal Mario was here.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Don&rsquo;t
let the circus freaks out,&rdquo; Daffodil sneered from the safety of
outside.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Emery was
covered in dirt and grime and water. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&hellip;
What am I agreeing to again?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">This.&rdquo;
Chomper&rsquo;s battle cry made the gangs from outside pour into the
hospital. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Booigi&rsquo;s
head spun as bikers zipped past left and right, their wet tires
leaving streaks all around in their rampage. Vick swung around
hungrily and took a big bite out of whoever got close with a little
too much pleasure. Rou T. once again swung over the counter and
started chasing baddies with that shotgun, making everyone near duck
to avoid her badly aimed bullet barrage. A blooper tripped her up and
she fell head first into Probabilly&rsquo;s mop bucket.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Don&rsquo;t
mind me.&rdquo; The old paratroopa continued to mop the wooden floor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jr. Troopa
used his crutches to jab at some Dry Bonez Gang members. A bone they
threw back whacked a noki nurse in the face, knocking him into the
wall and sending knickknacks to scatter on the ground. A toad girl
hesitantly held a flower pot in her hands as she tip toed behind a
cheep cheep on a bike who was just sitting there. She cracked it over
his head and he fell out cold.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh,
my gosh. I did something! Yay!&rdquo; the traveling sister toad
cheered.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey
pretty thing, let me talk to you!&rdquo; Leo the bony beetle started
chasing her around. She ran and the chase went out of the doors.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jr. Troopa
had a table tossed at him by a Big Bertha. She shoved and flung
nurses and volunteers of the south left and right and was heading
straight towards Doctor Mario when she suddenly slipped up and rammed
her head into a wall. In an instant a mounted dino rhino fell off the
wall and became wedged comically on over her head.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Watch
your step, hear?&rdquo; Probabilly put down a wet floor sign and then
proceeded to mop again.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Mario
abandoned the door to hide under a table petrified, as in Smash
Brothers there were never real injuries. Here however was another
story. Down the doors came on both sides allowing the ravenous sick,
all red eyed and foaming at the mouth to enter the fray, attacking
both MK South staff and baddie. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Emery,
Nukem, Daffodil, and Chomper watched the whole thing again safely
from outside.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lame.&rdquo;
Daffodil began to file her nails. &ldquo;Oh well. There&rsquo;s
always other places to take over.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo; Everyone spun around to face Booigi.
&ldquo;You tricked me into helping you cause this. Now you will pay.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Chomper
laughed arrogantly and brought out his fish hook. &ldquo;Have fun
with that, mate.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Booigi
grabbed the five hundred pound baddie and his weapon and tossed both
into the storming sky. With an Earth rumbling boom, a blinding ball
of lightning came out of nowhere and collided with the spear, which
struck Chomper in an explosion. Booigi brought their arm out to catch
the fish took that transformed into a trident. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Emery,
Daffodil, and Nukem screamed their lungs out and scattered into the
rain. As Nukem was running for his life, he first thought to dial
emergency services. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hello?!
Please please please help me! There&rsquo;s a lunatic chasing me
right now!!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mmmm,
I suppose so. Maybe you should have thought about that before you
joined the terrorists.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Terrorists??!&rdquo;
Nukem frowned. &ldquo;I suppose got wrapped up trying to stick with
these younger guys emergency person, but- but you still have to help
me right? I&rsquo;m sorry okay?&hellip; Umm, hello??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A pink
sticky tongue emerged out of the speaker startling him. The phone
fell to the ground just as Booigi materialized above it, cackling. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daffodil
meanwhile ran into a cave that was attached to Mt. Rugged. She leaned
against the side to catch her breath. Her damp clothes were making
her shiver, so she took off the yellow blouse she wore in imitation
of Daisy and only had an undershirt and shorts on. Without the
clothes, and with her wet hair having lost the style it was in, she
didn&rsquo;t really resemble the Sarasaland princess any longer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She kicked
a rock farther in the cave where it was pitch black. &ldquo;I should
have stuck with doing impersonations in the theater and left this
baddie stuff alone...&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
should have,&rdquo; a voice said from before her. A bright white
flash went off and Booigi emerged from the darkness holding a Nukem&rsquo;s
camera. Daffodil missed that however because she was too busy
wrapping her arms around herself with a flush.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
screwball, what are you doing?? I can&rsquo;t let anyone see me out
of character. Don&rsquo;t run from me!!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She chased
Boo out of the cave and through the mud, heading toward the little
settlement until she crossed an item shop. She heard a whistle and
turned to see the shopkeeper, Rowf and Rhuff, and several others
there hiding in the makeshift item shop tent gazing at her half
dressed. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Looking
good! I love this I Spy badge!&rdquo; Rhuff snickered until Rowf
smacked him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With a
high pitched squeal she ran blindly away from the men, rushing into a
smelly old yoshi staple.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Emery ran
around back towards the boarder where Toad Town was just a mile
ahead. She had no idea how she had allowed her friends to drag her
into so much trouble, but the seriousness of it all was like a punch
to the face. Emery gave up and sunk to her knees.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;m
sorry!&rdquo; she said to no one. &ldquo;I wish I could start all
over!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A white
orb was before her. &ldquo;Somehow I remember you from yesterday. You
called yourself a &lsquo;Do-gooder&rsquo;. Now look at you.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She bent
her head up towards Booigi who held the trident. &ldquo;I know what I
said, but just I&rsquo;m a stupid teenager, okay? Kylie was right!
But I can't fix this anymore. We can't fix anything anymore!&rdquo;
She wept bitterly in the rain. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Stop
already, idiot!&rdquo; a small distance away, Leo tussled with the
traveling sister toad in the rain.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Never!&rdquo;
</font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">For
real. I&rsquo;m trying to truce with you. Me and Phil decided that-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Leave
her be,&rdquo; Booigi zapped the trident as a warning, striking the
ground and making Leo&rsquo;s shoes catch on fire.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Owww!!
Not you again!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Other dry
bones gang members came up, with Phil taking the lead. &ldquo;We got
bigger fish to fry than this baddie stuff.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daffodil,
who wore a barrel over her body, Nukem who&rsquo;s pink bob-omb skin
was pure white, and Chomper who was scarred up black and covered in
bandages while being pushed in a wheelchair also met them. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah.
Don&rsquo;t you see how dark the sky is for it to only be seven o
clock? Something ain&rsquo;t right,&rdquo; Daffodil said.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
could redeem yourselves by going back to that hospital and helping
out.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Everyone
looked at Booigi like they were a freak. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
shrugged. &ldquo;Fine. If you want to flee this time, I won&rsquo;t
stop you.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After a
pause Emery spoke up first. &ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll do it. Don&rsquo;t
look at me like that, I used to be a nurse and we honestly don&rsquo;t
get paid enough for what we have to put up with.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Phil put
his head back on, which had gotten bopped off again at some point.
&ldquo;At least we&rsquo;ll be out of the rain. What do you say?&rdquo;
Leo and their other five or so dry bones members agreed.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Us
too. We have to make it up to you somehow,&rdquo; Daffodil said.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been rotten friends.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yes...I&rsquo;ll..never...live..with..myself...if..I...don't.&rdquo;
Nukem said.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
paraplegic Chomper blinked his eyes twice, indicating that he had no
objections.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">One
problem though,&rdquo; Emery said. &ldquo;Who can handle these guys?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A white
little bird swoop down from the sky and perched on Booigi&rsquo;s
trident. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Squawk!
The superstars can! Squawk!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Everyone
faced the North as a large doom ship radiating rainbow colors crossed
the boarder to invade Southern Mushroom Kingdom.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">ATTENTION,&rdquo;
came a voice from the ship originating from a speaker. &ldquo;THIS
LAND IS NOW PROPERTY OF KING BOWSER KOOPA&hellip; HA! Did I get you??
You should have seen the looks on your stupid faces!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ah
hem,&rdquo; spoke up another voice that sounded like Mario.
&ldquo;Actually, we&rsquo;re here to deliver the cure for the
Mushroom Flu! Make way for our landing!&rdquo;</font></p>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser&rsquo;s
airship approached the Southern hospital to a welcoming party of
Booigi, Emery, her baddie friends, the remaining members of the Dry
Bonez Thugz and the Seaworthy Switchblades, the staff and volunteers
of the hospital, and lastly Birdley perched on the roof. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Welcome
to Southside, partners!&rdquo; Jr. Troopa waved the ship down and it
descended &lsquo;gracefully&rsquo; on top of their nearby shed house,
flatting the wooden structure completely.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Probabilly
nodded his head that way. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get yer britches in a
bunch. I can fix it right up.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser was
the first off board, mostly because everyone forced him to be. Rain
poured on his head and he was just generally soggy all over, giving
the very best first impression. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
am King Bowser, ya know me. By the way, you are my new slave labor
force!&rdquo; he said with a toothy grin until Peach and Mario step
off very unhappily with that statement.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Vick the
ptooie kept staring. &ldquo;Y&rsquo;all ain&rsquo;t them sheet freaks
are ya???&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The blue
Noki &lsquo;Laki&rsquo; punched Vick in the side with his good arm.
&ldquo;He means we heard you guys were in Sarasaland and that place
got&hellip; you know. Its all over the news.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dears..&rdquo;
Peach held her parasol with nervous tension. &ldquo;-Just know we&rsquo;re
safe now.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah
and don&rsquo;t worry about the koopas. We banded together for a cure
and now we&rsquo;re going to deliver it.&rdquo; Mario noticed their
allies were &lsquo;interesting&rsquo; consisting of rednecks, random
weirdos, and thugs but helping hands were helping hands and he
wouldn&rsquo;t judge.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Buddy!
How did you get here?&rdquo; Luigi asked upon seeing Boo.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Their eyes
locked and Booigi instantly dissolved into a more familiar shivering
blithering form. &ldquo;L-luigi?! I don&rsquo;t even now how I got
here!&rdquo; They ran up to hug the green plumber tightly, weeping
into his blue overalls. Luigi reciprocated though he didn&rsquo;t
really get it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario,
Bowser, the Koopalings, Junior, Peach, Daisy, Toad, Toadsworth, Dr.
Toadley, his intern, Yoshi, Toadette, Thomas, the MKDCU, Alagold,
Buckenberry and lastly Luigi and Boo piled up at the front porch of
the hospital where Dr. Mario gape at the approaching party. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Long
time no see to all of you!&rdquo; Dr. Mario turned to Jr. Troopa
beside him. &ldquo;I mean, forget a few extra volunteers showing up.
You sent the whole gosh darn cavalry!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
teenager dropped his unsent letters to the wet porch with a sheepish
look. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t me and honestly&rdquo; he said in a hushed
normal accent, &ldquo;I'm scared to go in there again. I&rsquo;ve
seen what they can do to you and I'd rather fly across the ocean in
one go or go back to boot camp before I run in that place.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario and
pals lightly chuckled among each other. The plumber went ahead.
&quot;Don&rsquo;t worry. I&rsquo;m sure it can't be that bad...OH
MY-&quot; Peeking through a sliver between boards, Mario&rsquo;s
moustache went limp and his knees buckled. Bowser tore off a wooden
board to let everyone rushing up clearly see the disarray within.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">One
coma walking patient is knocking down walls. Another is screaming and
wailing like a crazed animal. One is swinging a chair around. Another
is gnawing on the leg of another. A yoshi is destroying everything in
sight,&rdquo; Morton commentated before being slapped and forced to
shut up. Either way their excitement plummeted faster than a thwomp
falling off of Mt. Rugged&rsquo;s peak.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Among the
murmuring and confusion that ensued Bowser pulled Mario aside. &ldquo;I
know that&rsquo;s a hot mess in there, but if something's gonna get
done, it'll be cause of us and not these other losers. This is still
about OUR rivalry still, or frenemyship, or whatever still right?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
squeezed between them and scoffed. &ldquo;-Am I not worthy of
assisting? I am feeling audacious!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
groaned, observing the constantly jiggling door knob. &ldquo;Hold the
door or something.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
surprised Mario by coming up. &ldquo;Homeboy, whatever you decide I&rsquo;m
for it. I&rsquo;ve already died once today technically, Dr. Toadley
told me.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
gasped. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sorry
I didn&rsquo;t mention it princess, I should have TOAD you all. Get
it?&rdquo; Toad smiled cheesily. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy
barged up to the front. &ldquo;I have a death machine in the airship
that could help with this!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy!?
Come back- Oh never mind. Everyone execute formation: balino!&rdquo;
Ludwig command, trying to get all the attention again. He meant to
say &lsquo;impetus&rsquo; however so<br/>
Lemmy, Morton, and Junior
promptly got in a military style line and march their tails instead
right to the outhouse. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Do
I have landmines saved? Yes I do.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mary
nudged Dr. Toadley&rsquo;s side while smiling in a forced way. &ldquo;No
you don&rsquo;t...&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">James and
his squad came up. &ldquo;Youse just give us the signal.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So
what will it be?&rdquo; Bowser turn to Mario. &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t
no save blocks here. Now or nothing.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario&rsquo;s
eyes shift to his rival with a sly smile. &ldquo;See you in the
Overthere.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser was
for a moment caught off guard but then he also flash him the &lsquo;grin&rsquo;.
&ldquo;You too, plumber breath!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
pulled open the door, allowing a crew that now only consisted of
Mario, Bowser, Ludwig, Iggy (holding a black tube), Toad, Peach,
Daisy, Toadsworth, Dr. Toadley, Mary, Buckenberry, Daisy, the MKDCU,
Dr. Mario, a few straggling baddies and bikers, a couple nurses and
volunteers that weren&rsquo;t beaten too badly, and Birdley (if
immediately perching on the ceiling fan counted) to CHARGE!!!</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It was an
odd feeling to know you were supposed to be dead coming from someone
who had narrowly escaped with their life in many a time during
adventures, but that was the boat Captain Toad was in&hellip; That
one and Bowser&rsquo;s airship. Just then he was startled by Alagold
plopped down on the bench across from him.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Don&rsquo;t
mind me, Bro. I was uh, seeing things.&rdquo; Alagold rested rather
abruptly on the table.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Captain
Toad ducked down as more entered the docked vessel, Yoshi, Luigi,
Boo, and a few koopalings. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
grabbed a seat. &ldquo;You guys try to wake up Millennium Star. I&rsquo;m
really tired all a sudden.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo inched
closer to Luigi when loud thunder boomed. &ldquo;But what if that
star person never wakes up??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
gulped. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well,
I saved this from the castle.&rdquo; Toadette held up a rusty pot. &ldquo;I
can bang on it for noise. I would have had more but a certain front
door guard bailed on us to join his uncle in the downtown.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
fine, Toadette. There&rsquo;s enough of us to do this, we just have
to be loud and annoying.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
glared at Luigi. &ldquo;Is that a diss at us?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah,
I am NOT loud or annoying!&rdquo; Wendy covered her mouth quickly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Roy barged
ahead. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get to not working already!&rdquo; And so
they all went upstairs aside from Yoshi who napped. Thinking the
coast was clear, Captain Toad got up.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-I
say! I could have stayed in the tussle for a little longer!&rdquo; an
elderly voice said.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Please
chill out. You didn&rsquo;t even make it inside before you slipped
and fell and the Princess would worry if you stayed anyway. Set next
to, er, Stan over there!&rdquo; Toad motioned to Captain Toad who had
no choice now but to wish he was invisible.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadsworth
sat next to Alagold with a somewhat juvenile huff of annoyance while
holding an ice pack to his bruised face. &ldquo;Master Toad, take
this will you? I was always meant to be a gift.&rdquo; He dug in his
small knapsack and pulled out an old book labeled &lsquo;IV&rsquo;,
the same one that was laying next to Toad when he passed out and the
same book Russ observed before going mad. It was slightly water
damaged but still even had the bookmark firmly in place. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh,
uh, okay.&rdquo; Toad grabbed &lsquo;IV&rsquo;, giving it a once
over.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It
is a nice little read if you are in for a brain twist. It is from an
ancient explorer &lsquo;Zheng Koopa&rsquo; and all that but
unfinished! It just seemed important, so I took it before the castle
flooded over,&rdquo; the old mushroom explained.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
smiled to be polite. &ldquo;Thanks Toadsworth.&rdquo; He leaned in on
Captain Toad&rsquo;s side. &ldquo;By the way, relax. I get that it
was an accident, homeboy. I&rsquo;ll even send ya the good stuff
before you get probation,&rdquo; he said conspiratorially. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Pardon?&rdquo;
Toadsworth questioned.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Nothing,
old man. I gotta go.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mr.
Toad,&rdquo; Captain Toad spoke up when the thought crossed his mind.
&ldquo;Your book. I explored some old ruins once. I think that might
have been written shortly after old world Sarasaland collapsed on
itself-&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Like
what happened to Mario and Peach? Uh huh?? So does this have clues or
something? Tell me.&rdquo; He shoved the book under Captain Toad&rsquo;s
nose.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Delimited
by the natural and bestowed potential by..the unshakable shadow shed
by its origin&rsquo;..&rdquo; Captain Toad read before stopping to
lean back sadly. &ldquo;Sir, I&rsquo;m not sure I get it.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ah.
That makes two of us!&rdquo; Toadsworth said.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">But
this could be important,&rdquo; Toad stressed, beating the table.
&ldquo;&hellip;.Y&rsquo;all know any puzzle specialists for this book
thing??&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Captain
Toad leaned up abruptly. &ldquo;Sir, that is highly specific but in
fact I do!&rdquo;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Deep below
Toad Town Spy Guy handed over an updated census of the capital city.
There were exactly one hundred residents left, all tucked away
somewhere and undetectable to all but the most savvy discoverer.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
see there are three more than last time.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yes
sir. It was very unusual, like a ball of lightning.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The paper
was sat down. &ldquo;Does this have something to do with the void?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
void?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Agent N
handed over a photograph. &ldquo;This was the last image taken from
our satellite.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Spy Guy
lifted it closer to his face then spun it upside down, trying and
failing to find any meaning behind the completely black image. &ldquo;Umm,
what is this?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That&rsquo;s
above the clouds right now!&rdquo; Agent N replied like that was a
dumb question. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;ll have to-&rdquo;
Someone knocked with a thud sound.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Spy Guy
pushed open the box flap, exposing the Super Spy HQ&rsquo;s &lsquo;office&rsquo;
for what it was, a single large cardboard box located in a Shy Guy&rsquo;s
Toybox Blue Station.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Where&rsquo;s
Kylie?&rdquo; Geno asked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Without a
word, Spy Guy blew a dart designed to instantly debilitate any living
thing at Geno.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
a way to introduce yourself, Charles.&rdquo; Unharmed, Geno flicked
if off and it bounced on the floor. &ldquo;So again, where is she?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Agent N, a
slim orange yoshi undistinguished from any other aside from the very
nice suit he wore, crawled out of the box. &ldquo;Who are you and
what are you doing here?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Don&rsquo;t
worry about me Jeremy, just know that I caught Zoo and Jeletro for
you guys and I need to speak to Kylie. I know she&rsquo;s here.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Agent N
glanced at Spy Guy.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Never
mind, here she is.&rdquo; Geno spun around as the indoors train came
rolled up to the station stop, whistle blowing. Kylie Koopa was right
in the caboose looking straight ahead as she squeezed an effigy of
Zoo in her hands in a creepy manner.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Geno&rsquo;s
smile faltered. &ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Her head
slowly craned his way. &ldquo;Where are they??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The star
warrior snapped his fingers, making his Shooting Star car and its
passengers miraculously appear behind him. Seating the back seats
were Jelectro and Zoo suspended inside of a thick yellow crystal.
Zoo&rsquo;s eyes dart over to them all and Jelectro's expression
changed ever so slightly, indicating that they were both still
conscious. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wonderful.&rdquo;
Kylie rubbed her hands together.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Send
them to the cells,&rdquo; Agent N ordered before turning
inquisitively back to Geno. &ldquo;So you don&rsquo;t even have a
name? We&rsquo;ve never had an uh, infiltrator quite like you...&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;m
not from around, call me Geno,&rdquo; Geno answered as Spy Guy
prepared to take the prisoners away. &ldquo;It would be hard to
pronounce anyway. Just know I follow a higher authority and I&rsquo;m
on a criminal investigation of my own I guess you can say. That boo
is using a bell that connected to a real villain in the sky. A Dark
Star.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
stopped drooling at Zoo and Bond. &ldquo;Right.. right right right.
Where will they be held?&rdquo; She asked flatly.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">In
an ultra secure cage where Agent 0064&rsquo;s public interference
yesterday will be thoroughly investigated. If that boo really is the
train station killer from this morning, that will be taken care of
also.&rdquo; He clapped two times an a shifty eyed secret agent came
from a backroom riding a go cart styled like a cutesy little train.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Agent
0069 reporting.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Get
out of that thing,&rdquo; Agent N snapped. &ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t
Agent 0088 and M reported back yet? They were supposed to be the ones
bringing Agent 0064.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The bandit
shrugged as Geno gave a start.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Them?!
Jelectro and Zoo were in their car and there were bodies in the
trunk!&rdquo; Geno explained.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Agent N
pulled a radio up. &ldquo;Interrogate the prisoners now. Show no
mercy,&rdquo; he hissed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
heard the whole thing and began to laugh under her breath. Geno
instead went back outside to get himself together. Rain made his blue
clothing soggy as he pondered. He&rsquo;d investigated the portal
above to find that it was in reality a remote projection of
concentrated dark matter, inanimate in every way, a killer that was
neither live nor dead. He didn&rsquo;t get it, where was the dark
star mastermind hiding? How did Zoo become the keeper of a
destruction summoning bell? Why did that noki agent risk so much to
shelter Zoo? That wasn&rsquo;t even touching the fact that he was
supposed to be on house arrest at the moment. A great cowboy cop he
was not..</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He tried
to enter the HQ again 20 minutes later to find something disturbing.
Two things actually. He could feel another star being near, but the
other thing:</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
couldn&rsquo;t get back in the building...</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Topper
sneezed, almost dropping his hot tea. With that close call he knocked
on the office door of Dr. Toad. &ldquo;Drew, come out. I won&rsquo;t
bite.&rdquo; His cellular shopper rung and he tucked the folders he
held under his arm to answer. &ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hello?
Doc, this is Toad the castle adviser. We just needed some help with
this thing called a &lsquo;book&rsquo;.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
wow! What do you need?&rdquo; Dr. Topper asked attentively, eager to
be charitable.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;m
not good with big words, but here I go.&rdquo; As Toad read out loud
the entire page, three more people were entering the airship.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daisy
jerked away from the nurse. &ldquo;-But I&rsquo;ve only been stabbed
twice. Com'on!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sorry,
but that&rsquo;s not normal,&rdquo; Emery said, backing away. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Looks
normal to me,&rdquo; Sebastian said. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
grimaced when he noticed the two sharp wooden planks that impaled
Daisy on her arm and leg. Daisy only ignored them and went upstairs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Back at
the hospital, Dr. Topper was listening so intently he didn&rsquo;t
notice Dr. Toad in the open doorway tapping a foot impatiently and
staring holes in him. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Associate,
who is that?!&rdquo; the toad doctor bark.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Topper
raised one finger up in a &lsquo;just a moment&rsquo; gesture. </font>
</p>
<p><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
stage act in play for millennium past of actors a facsimile of their
roles and those scorned..<br/>
Delimited by the natural and bestowed
potential by..the unshakable shadow shed by its origin&rsquo;..</font></em>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Okay
so while it&rsquo;s as old as you say, it doesn&rsquo;t sound like a
riddle, at least not intentionally. I&rsquo;d even venture that the
author wanted people to understand. That first part means that the
stars watch over us like a stage play working out, however the text
referred to someone making a crude copy of these &lsquo;actors&rsquo;
or people. The last verse about being limited, that thing is tied to
the power of its owner but it can only be gotten rid of &lsquo;shed&rsquo;
by taking it back where it came from.&rdquo; Dr. Topper paused. &ldquo;What
object are we talking about?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">On the
other end back at the airship, Emery over heard the call, recognizing
Topper&rsquo;s voice and finding familiar the topic. Overcome with
guilt she dashed out. Sebastian tapped her on the shoulder in
passing.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Where
are you going?&rdquo; He asked. &ldquo;Believe it or not, I&rsquo;m
also a Boo hunter. Didn&rsquo;t you work with that celebrity on
something like this?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Emery
froze with one foot out the door, turning back towards her former
classmate. &ldquo;Kylie isn&rsquo;t a celebrity and we were talking
about bells, not boos!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
leaned his head up, blinking twice in recognition of Emery. &ldquo;Miss?
I&rsquo;m sorry for offending you yesterday, I know it seems forever
ago, but if you know something you need to tell us.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Emery took
a deep breath and step back in as several eyes laid upon her. &ldquo;Kylie
was researching this stuff. Me and her aren&rsquo;t so tight anymore
but maybe mention it anyway.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad pick
the phone up. &ldquo;Doc, you heard that?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">At the
Special World Hospital Dr. Topper nodded, still ignoring an
increasingly annoyed Dr. Toad. &ldquo;Sure. She even stopped here for
some reason earlier and made me catch a head cold standing in the
rain. I&rsquo;ll see if I can reach her.&rdquo; He dropped his folder
in Dr. Toad&rsquo;s hands and left, confusing the toad doctor until
he opened it up and found many drawings from Dr. Topper&rsquo;s
classroom saying to &lsquo;Get well soon&rsquo;, all addressed to his
father Lou Diddley. Dr. Toad might have stood in the door way for
five minutes after.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Back in
the South, everyone was somewhat overwhelmed by the info dump except
for Toadsworth. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
say! Have we opened, what you call, a can of worms?&rdquo; he
ventured.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Agent N
approached Bond&rsquo;s cell. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Anti
Guy, you can step back.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
assassin took one more glance at Bond and then got lost, moving away
from the sturdy cage. Agent N stooped to Bond&rsquo;s level for a
moment.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Mon
ami.&rdquo; Bond jolted Agent N out of his thoughts. &ldquo;You are
correct, I have not rebelled, joined Bowser, or have been replaced by
a doppelganger.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Agent N
stood up straight and cleared his throat. He quickly check that they
were indeed alone in the room. &ldquo;Then why did you do it?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond slid
his broken and lopsided glasses up. &ldquo;Let me and Zoo go first.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ha
ha ha. No. You left your vacation after my first call to you,
correct?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond
nodded. &ldquo;I did leave to check on your niece but after many
twist and turns I had to refocus. This is bigger than even us. You
have to let us go.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hmm.
I&rsquo;ll think about it.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond
gripped the bars harder. &ldquo;Think??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
are in an alliance with Zoo. You know what he does to people.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
more complected than you think-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
doubt it. It&rsquo;s annoying enough listening to you like this at
home so I won&rsquo;t do it here. Bye bye.&rdquo; And leaving Bond
speechless, Agent N left to check in on the rest of the circus
animals that were his agents.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Back in
the Blue Station, a thwomp slowly step back in horror at whatever was
going on in the Pink Station ahead. The bandit Agent 0069 ran
screaming from there while holding his mask tight to his face. Agent
N briskly entered to investigate, finding Zoo&rsquo;s eyes meeting
his immediately. The pink station had a playful look with pink
painted walls and stuff teddy bears and building blocks for
decoration, all covered with splotches of fresh blood. Agent N tried
to back out before he felt a stabbing pain in his stomach. He fell to
the ground and lost his lunch while Zoo cackled. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Listen
up. Bring Kylie to me or you&rsquo;ll cough up more than that,&rdquo;
Zoo hissed, dropping the laughing act in an instant. &ldquo;Get up.
Now!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Agent N
dragged himself up. Zoo was locked in their special nigh impenetrable
and anti teleportation jail cells, but it didn&rsquo;t work against
mind power apparently. Meeting back at the entrance area where his
&lsquo;office&rsquo; was were the whole team and a stationary train
with Kylie still in it. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo..
wants.. to.. see.. you!&rdquo; Agent N collapsed on the floor with
rumpled soiled clothes. The other agents glared at him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Spy Guy
glared. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t send her to him!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Is
it still bleeding? It&rsquo;s still bleeding!&rdquo; Agent 0069
whimpered while Agent Maria tended to his wounds, which were
unfortunately for him bleeding eye sockets.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
is right, Monsieur,&rdquo; the French woman said sternly. The pink
shelled Noki, Maria, put down the gauze and stood up to an approval
of the remaining agents, 999, Anti Guy, Toad, and W. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah,
we&rsquo;re reporting this to HQ,&rdquo; a fat masked human, Agent W
warned. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Agent N
got in his face, inches away from the humans bulbous nose. &ldquo;We
ARE HQ.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Of
this region yeah, but not the planet. Money talks and we&rsquo;re so
poor we have to rent this amusement park,&rdquo; Agent Toad quip.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
is enough!&rdquo; Agent N turned to Kylie. &ldquo;Little miss
reporter, if you wish to mix yourself with our affairs, you will obey
me. Don&rsquo;t even think of trying to blackmail us with your Koopa
Kronicle.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Koopa&hellip;
Kronicle?&rdquo; Kylie mumbled while her old fashioned analog phone.
While her mind was too clouded to recognize the caller id, it wasn&rsquo;t
too much to be eager to learn new information. &ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie?
Neato, I knew phone books weren&rsquo;t obsolete just yet. This is
Dr. Topper and I&rsquo;ve been speaking with some of your friends
about something you were researching. I know when you visited me at
my day job you mentioned a Zoo being here-?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">ZOO?!&rdquo;
Kylie put it on speaker phone, which let everyone hear the call with
the echo like acoustics of the room.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah
him! Wow, love that enthusiasm! I never knew him, but I got a hint to
check his profile. Yeah, he had a bell or something and there&rsquo;s
this book your other friends have implying that the bell is doing
something with the sky. You&rsquo;d better look into this, I don&rsquo;t
know how bad it is from way out in Special World where I&rsquo;m at,
but it sounds serious. I-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">N-nothing
else about Zoo??&rdquo; Kylie asked, sweaty and deranged.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hmm.
No. I can only do so much from here. You&rsquo;re the reporter, am I
right? Take care.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The call
hung up and everything was silent before Kylie toot the whistle on
the train.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">DIDN'T
YOU HEAR? ZOO IS CAUSING THE PORTAL AND BOND KNEW THIS. DESTROY THEM
BOTH NOW!&rdquo; She threw the train into a hard reverse to go where
Bond was being held. The agents scrambled to catch up, and Anti Guy
and Agent W got hit and dragged along. When Kylie careened into
Bond&rsquo;s room, his cage was empty. Kylie jumped off and rushed
the cage along with Agent N.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After a
quick look Agent N spun around, eyes flaring dangerously. &ldquo;Who
had the keys??&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ouch...I
gave them to&hellip; her!&rdquo; Agent W used the one arm that wasn&rsquo;t
broken to point to Maria.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The female
noki only crossed her arms. &ldquo;Maybe so, oui?&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Agent N
towered over her, shaking in agitation. &ldquo;Why would you do
that?!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Maria
turned her head and said nothing.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Spy
Guy. Take care of her!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Spy Guy
froze. &ldquo;..Agent I-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Do
it!&rdquo; He pointed at her and at his call, a dart was shot at the
noki. She hardly had time to realize what had just happened when the
venom from the dart spread through her body. She pass away right then
on colorful tiled flooring, agents around her all in shock while she
herself regretted nothing. Bond, a close friend and partner back in
the day did not deserve what her agency was trying to do. That, and
she just knew somehow that her death would not be in vain. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Agent N
looked up from her body like he couldn&rsquo;t believe what had just
happened. &ldquo;Did anyone check on Zoo?&rdquo; he eventually asked,
voice wavering.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He&rsquo;s
also gone,&rdquo; Agent Toad answered, checking his time slip for
when his next break would be. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Find
them both. They are maximum level threats at this point.&rdquo; Agent
N hesitated only for a moment before hitting a switch that sealed all
of the doors electronically but also using some sort of force field
he didn&rsquo;t even understand, per strict protocol. No more entry
or exiting now. Understanding this, all of the agents gulped.</font></p>

Southern Hospital the sick were roaming and they&rsquo;d need to
catch all fifty or so. Mario and Bowser teamed up in the lobby to
focus first on an infected whomp who was in a frenzy. Slam! All
knickknacks clashed to the ground. Slam! There went the rest of the
drywall. Slam! </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Can
I be with ya&rsquo;ll?&rdquo; A boney beetle with an urban accent and
red bandana asked them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Leo. My buddy left me so I
ain&rsquo;t got nowhere to go!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
snorted. &ldquo;You joined my army once and dropped out a week later.
Also you smoke that stank fire flower.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario spun
around only for a second. &ldquo;Okay, feel free to... RUN!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Everyone
moved just in time as the whomp attack. He flopped down with an Earth
shattering boom to flatten them, snapping in half a table, but got
stuck that way.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
saved the day!&rdquo; Leo did a dab.</font></p>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Squawk!

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ooh!
Let me handle this, bruthas.&rdquo; Leo shot a ton of spikes that
rain down everywhere. Mario, now impaled all over, tumbled around
until he tripped over Rou T.&rsquo;s La-Z-Boy chair. Leo scram before
Bowser could strangle him.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah,
yeah,&rdquo; Mario muttered grimly, still dizzy and flipped over that
chair, &ldquo;This is a good look for me, right?..&rdquo;</font></p>

bumped up against something. The object pulled him suddenly into its
oddly chilly embrace. </font>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
got your message. Sorry about your noki girlfriend.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond

you with me to the end? This is it.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dude
of course! What do we do?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond
smiled in the darkness. &ldquo;Ah- The stars aligned and I overheard
an obnoxiously loud phone call from Kylie. While I am hardly at base
we must have something here to work with to fly that bell to the
moon. I will do that while you look for a way out of here. I figure
you would rather not interact with anyone, yes? How good are you at
spying around?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;m

joke or not that was the plan and they were sticking to it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">On the
second floor left wing, the blue toad named Buckenberry gave a swift
right hook. Down the infected patient went in a heap of clothing.
&ldquo;Were you filming that for my Facenote profile like I asked?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mary
gaped. &ldquo;You just knocked out an old lady!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He gave a
second glance at the victim, finally noticing the granny panties and
dislodged dentures. &ldquo;Oops.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Quiet.
Is a patient over there? Yes it is!&rdquo; Dr. Toadley pointed to an
empty broom closet, listening. In a poof of smoke an infected ninji
revealed themselves and sprint down the hallway. &ldquo;Do I think
so? No I do not!&rdquo; He tossed something which exploded in the
hallway, filling it with smoke that didn&rsquo;t bother him while his
two companions choke. The ninji however made it down the stairs and
the eccentric doctor was prevented from following due to someone
grabbing him.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
the heck is wrong with you?!&rdquo; Buckenberry screamed in his face.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Then with
a breeze the smoke cleared out in seconds and the world became
breathable again. Mario showed up out of nowhere behind a large
whirling industrial blower. &ldquo;I was just passing through. Are

always been a fan..&rdquo;</font></em></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Anti-Guy
was in the maintenance area&rsquo;s storage room were it was dark and
illuminated only by the glowing power hungry television screen and
terrestrial sonar. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Stop
running up the electric bill, idiot!&rdquo; Agent W barged in, hardly
fitting in the narrow space. Anti-Guy in turn pinched a pressure
point on his shoulder relentlessly. &ldquo;YOOOOW!&rdquo; Pain
rippled through W&rsquo;s body for five seconds before he was pushed
out of the room with the door slamming shut.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bruised
mostly ego wise, Agent W traversed dim corridors to reach the Blue
Station where Agent N was standing around the sealed doors. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Finally
someone. Watch this while I take a leak okay?&rdquo; the yoshi asked
right away.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">W picked
his nose idly. &ldquo;Seriously? Can I just go home?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No.
And don&rsquo;t break anything,&rdquo; N said, walking off. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">W stood
around pouting until he decided to peek into his superior&rsquo;s
snack stash in the office box thing. It was the usual tasteless
vacuum sealed stuff, so he stood by the electrified double doors with
nothing to do until an intruder came up. &ldquo;Hey it&rsquo;s-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Didn&rsquo;t
I see you earlier today at Special World&rsquo;s Applebys?&rdquo; Zoo
asked. &ldquo;You were that cook in the back.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">W sized
Zoo up, being quite larger. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t remember ya but I wish
I would have. Your boss Bowser brought down FungusUp yesterday and I
had good stock there.&rdquo; W smirked at Zoo&rsquo;s dumbfounded
look. &ldquo;I did some personal digging on you, see? And I know your
full story. Our databanks are the bes- Erk-!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo struck
him with the agony beam before the sentence ended. He came to and
stopped the invisible assault. Agent W collapsed at Zoo&rsquo;s feet,
bleached aside from blood originating from his ears and nose. Zoo
poked his body but he never woke up again. He eyes lingered on W for
a second, sweat gathering on his forehead, before dragging the body a
little ways into a dark and unoccupied room. With that panicky moment
over he returned with W&rsquo;s radio. It exploded like a small bomb
when Zoo toss it at the electric field, setting off smoke alarms and
sprinklers which freaked Zoo out again. The way out wouldn&rsquo;t be
the front door, he decided.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Agent N
suspected trouble if he took too long walking around the building to
the only known restroom. Now the sprinklers were on and everything.
Even more there was a faint pink hue in one of the water puddles,
then dry blood trial leading down the hall into the closet.
Cautiously he took a peek inside before jumping back at the sight.
Someone tap him on the shoulder. Anti-Guy appearing to be quite
flustered.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dark Land
commander Ludwig led his squadron of Lemmy, Morton, and Bowser
Junior, plus Jr. Troopa, Laki, and Phil like soldiers into battle,
systematically kicking open doors and dealing with whatever was
inside. When Ludwig was about to kick open door of room 400, the door
kicked him! The koopaling was launched backwards until a large
tentacle caught him and pulled him back in. He screamed for his life
while his claws scratched the floor. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
Junior gasped. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen enough of Iggy&rsquo;s cartoons
to know where this could go!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
turned to Junior. &ldquo;Did you get past the parental lock on the
WiiU? Or use the laptop?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Morton
beamed. &ldquo;Because if so that explains the viruses, the malware,
the technical support people that hold your computer hostage and
demand you to pay them in Fleabay gift cards!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Gah!
Move out of the way so we can help him!&rdquo; Jr. Troopa shoved
aside Bowser&rsquo;s kids to rush in. This patient room had a family
of sick bloopers floating around in the air and a giant one holding
Ludwig helplessly upside down near the window. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Anyone
hungry for seafood?&rdquo; Phil asked. The dry bones got a mean look
from Troopa. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;ll
get the small ones,&rdquo; Laki said. The noki used his short stature
to dodge around and poke some of the bloopers with the cure before
they could retaliate. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Stand
clear, I&rsquo;m gonna launch missiles!&rdquo; Bowser Junior almost
lit a match to prime his pocket bill-blaster until the words of his
father echoed in his mind. &ldquo;Oh no I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he
cried dramatically. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not safe and I could get hurt
very badly.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jr. Troopa
used his wings to dodge the bloopers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re
taking responsibility.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Which
is why,&rdquo; Bowser Junior continued, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you
older people do it. Here!&rdquo; He handed the heavy weapon to Jr.
Troopa. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an adult, right?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jr. Troopa
accepted a little too gleefully. &ldquo;Uh, close enough. I turn
seventeen next year!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yo,
wait!&rdquo; Phil warned but too late.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jr. Troopa
fired without the safety being on. The extremely pressurized blast
shot him backwards out the door and his target was sent the opposite
direction, crashing through the walls. CRASH. Both koopaling and
squid landed right on top of a perfectly restored shed house and
flattened it. Again.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Outside
Bowser was coming around the corner and saw the crash site. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t even wanna know.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Suddenly
Ludwig arose like in a horror movie and grabbed his leg.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Call...an...medic!&rdquo;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Spy Guy
and Agent 0069 occupied the pink station, a long wide passageway with
train tracks on one side and trenches of sorts Spy Guy designed to
ensnare an enemy if one would be kind enough to come along on the
other.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
understand N, over.&rdquo; Spy Guy terminated the radio session.
&ldquo;Wow, I can&rsquo;t believe Rodney would do that. I knew he was
weird but...&rdquo; Spy Guy stood up from his invisibility cloak.
&ldquo;Hello?? 0069?&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">0069
leaned back against a little podium against the tracks. &ldquo;Huh?
Didn&rsquo;t hear you. Check this out.&rdquo; He turned his phone
towards Spy Guy. Displayed on it was some sort of web page involving
&lsquo;Toadettes gone wild&rsquo;. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Spy Guy
frowned beneath his mask. &ldquo;Idiot.&rdquo; He was about to go
back when- Wham! Knocked off his feet, Spy Guy fell forward into a
sandbag. Quickly he reached for a weapon on his hip to find his tool
belt empty. &ldquo;Help!&rdquo; he screamed to Agent 0069 who
pretended to hear nothing.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Too
late.&rdquo; Right behind him, Jelectro Bond snapped the slingshot in
half. &ldquo;Now, mon ami-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Spy Guy
sprung towards Bond, tackling him down. &ldquo;Friend, huh??&rdquo;
He punched Bond in the face. &ldquo;Why does Jeremy always-&rdquo;
Punch. &ldquo;Treat you-&rdquo; Punch. &ldquo;Better than ME!!!&rdquo;
He socked him a fourth time, stopping to take a breath. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
his secretary but does he call my personal cell while I&rsquo;m on
vacations??&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond
rolled out of the way to miss Spy Guy&rsquo;s kick, simultaneously
getting hit with that feeling again- Spy Guy was under the control of
something! He dodged to avoid a poison dart. The sand bag behind him
ruptured and fine yellow dust filled the air.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Spy Guy
ran out of his own maze to escape the sandstorm. Near the tracks he
did a double take. Where Agent 0069 once sat was instead a small
chain-chomplet wagging its tail excitedly.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mr.
Snuggle Buns?!&rdquo; Spy Guy dropped everything to run up and hug
his lost pet. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Trevor&rsquo;s fault. If I knew he
was taking you for bomb sniffing-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond cut
the &lsquo;touching&rsquo; reunion short by whacking Spy Guy in the
back of the head. He fell out cold and the illusion shattered. &lsquo;Mr
Snuggle Buns&rsquo; was actually Agent 0069 blushing a lot. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
apologize for incorporating you into that trick. Have you any clue of
secrets here at base? Say, something similar to that lost satellite?&rdquo;
Bond avoid eye contact for reasons.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The bandit
shrugged, easing back into his lazy position. &ldquo;Not sure if this
helps but I stay up all night so sometimes I hear coming and going
near the red station.&rdquo; He returned to his mobile videos. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
understand completely.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
but thanks for earlier, Jelectro. I don&rsquo;t what happened just
then but no one ever hugs me voluntarily!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond
thought he heard a train whistle. &ldquo;Andrew, move out of the
way!&rdquo; A gush of air blasted Bond backwards. With a roar the
locomotive sped through the station, making Agent 0069 splat like a
bug. Bond felt punched in the gut figuratively yet more painfully
than anything Spy Guy had delivered shortly before.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
picked up a sweat rushing around the hospital curing whomever they
could. With her was a toad girl, a Daisy impersonator, a bob-omb
buddy, and a Boss Bass in a wheelchair- Quite the bunch.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What&rsquo;s
Daisy&rsquo;s favorite flavor of mushroom?&rdquo; was Daffodil&rsquo;s
fiftieth trivia question.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach got
between her and the uncomfortable toad girl. &ldquo;Do not pester her
anymore.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Then
what&rsquo;s your&rsquo;s lass?&rdquo; Chomper&rsquo;s gaze lingered
on Peach from behind. Before she could reply a patient sprint past
them into the dark basement that was ahead. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Nukem step
ahead of the group. &ldquo;Let me trudge forward fair maidens.&rdquo;
Peach tried to call him back but down the bob-bomb went.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He&rsquo;s
always &lsquo;white knighting&rsquo;, don&rsquo;t mind him,&rdquo;
Daffodil said, looking around shiftily. &ldquo;Psst. Real quick, I
missed Daisy&rsquo;s game yesterday so if you happen to know like,
any sweat droplets that hit the ground&hellip; Ooh! Or any strands of
hair lost and where I can find them?-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
traveling sister hid behind Peach. &ldquo;What are you talking
about?!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Chomper
got Daffodil to back off. &ldquo;Aye, forget that little lass. I just
thinks the blonde one raises me sails if ye know what I mean.&rdquo;
He grinned.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Before
things could get any more awkward, Nukem climb out of the basement
covered in layers of medical gauze. &ldquo;I should have known those
minions booby-trapped this baaaaassssmeeeent!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A stampede
of little critters, goombas, buzzy beetles, swoopers, and shell
creepers rushed up the steps. Running away, everyone rounded a corner
where Iggy wandered about aimlessly, impeded by a sign on a closed
door that said: &lsquo;Clean&rsquo;n goin&rsquo; on. Wait a sec,
hear?&rsquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy took
notice of the hoard. &ldquo;Ooh, I have a death machine for this!&rdquo;
He presented a small black tube that looked a lot like an internet
controlled virtual assistant. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Moshi
moshi, Koopdrandia desu? I await your command beautiful Iggy-sama!&rdquo;
it greeted.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lad,
what dark arts run that thing?&rdquo; Chomper questioned, staying
back.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Whatever
it is, I hope it can save us. Please tell us what to do!&rdquo; Peach
plead.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Aaa!
Mushroom Flu infectees can become disoriented from sound due to their
senses being amplified! Fufufufu!&rdquo; advised the machine.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy
scratched his head as the baddies surrounded them. The goombas and
swoopers bared their fangs while buzzies and shell creepers snap
their jaws ravenously. &ldquo;Who knows the most loud band ever? I
don&rsquo;t think my vocaloids will count.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach&rsquo;s
hand shot in the air. &ldquo;Play the Boo-Circle Jerks!&rdquo; A song
called: &lsquo;64&rsquo;ed (Good as Gameover)&rsquo; blasted from the
virtual assistant just in time to throw the infected into confusion.
Everyone step into high gear pricking the sick with the cure which
thankfully had a sleep inducing agent in it too. Peach and the toad
sister cheered together when Daffodil incidentally got in the way
between them and got knocked down.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
flushed. &ldquo;Dear, we did not mean to-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No,
not that. Two people that know Daisy just TOUCHED ME.&rdquo; Daffodil
happily fainted.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Chomper
wheeled up to Peach, patting his lap with a mischievous twinkle in
his eye. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t ye &lsquo;faint&rsquo; right here?
Har har.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
a creep, even by my standards.&rdquo; Iggy packed away his &lsquo;death
machine&rsquo; that, for the first time ever, actually wasn&rsquo;t.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The green
station is where Agent Toad put up a few cans of soda in a locker,
smuggled before the ban happened. He&rsquo;d been playing the slots
with Agent 999.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">C'mon!&rdquo;
he exclaimed when he lost again. &ldquo;I hope we move on from this
soon. I kind of wanted to leave the country you know? A movie&rsquo;s
going to be shot in Sky Land that could use a generic toad number
forty two and I&rsquo;ve been here all day. My feet are tired.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Agent 999
raised a thick eyebrow. &ldquo;Want a cookie, child?&rdquo; the aged
thwomp teased. His personal coin case was heavy.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Shut
your face.&rdquo; A moment later Agent Toad spot a dark boo that
appeared out of nowhere.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Open
that locker!!!&rdquo; Zoo demanded, meaning an overstuffed looking
one. &ldquo;I mean&hellip; please?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Agent Toad
reach for the alarm button and Zoo had to do something. He wasn&rsquo;t
sure what, but it was something alright that happened... The young
toad crouch down like to vomit only instead out of his mouth slid a
small pink sack that dangle over the floor, still attached to his
insides by a thin red cord that ran down his throat. Zoo was as taken
back as the other person in the room he hardly noticed. The thwomp
was backed into the corner with shallow breaths.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo spun
to Agent 999. &ldquo;Sooo, whatta bout you?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">N-never!&rdquo;
</font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Then
just stay out of my way.&rdquo; So Zoo pick the lock on his own. Out
of Agent Toad&rsquo;s locker spilled tons of manila folders that
covered Zoo up to his head. &ldquo;Oh, cool, I didn&rsquo;t expect
that,&rdquo; he mumbled from under the pile, focusing on one paper in
particular.</font></p>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The MKDCU
finally took a breather after the noise they&rsquo;d caused before.
None of the first floor rooms had doors anymore due to being knocked
off the hinges, their signature style. Dr. Mario, who was with them
taking the place of Sebastian, marked off a check list of rooms in
the front lobby, stunned at the results. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re off the
charts! Er, well mostly because this hospital&rsquo;s records are
incomplete and drawn in pencil, but still!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">James

Richard spot a stray yoshi running in. Parabilly tackled the dinosaur
down.</font></p>

got slurped up in their jowls.</font></p>

koopas, that doesn&rsquo;t mean she might not try!&rdquo; Dr. Mario
lead the chase that went out and through the shanty town surrounding
the hospital. They even pass Bowser&rsquo;s Airship, which had a
small group of people in front of the bow.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi,
Daisy, Roy, Larry, Wendy, and Boo watched Toadette bang her pots and
pans in an effort to wake up Millennium Star, whose dormant form was
attached to the vessel only as a curious decoration. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Okay,
now it's my turn. Watch my sweet moves.&rdquo; Larry said, glancing
in Daisy's direction. The brunette barely paid him any mind, instead
wrapping up her knuckles in preparation for something. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
fifteen year old Koopaling kicked the side of the ship, making only a
small knock. He hopped away with a bruised toe just as company
arrived.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Roy threw
his hands up. &ldquo;Skip my turn. I just wanted an excuse to get out
of working in the hospital.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yes,
here. Drop me. No, not there!&rdquo; Ludwig&rsquo;s slime covered
body fell roughly over supply barrels that surrounded the ship,
specifically landing on some broken ones with sharp edges.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">My

The ptooie plant snickered as he left.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wendy
rushed to her brother. &ldquo;What is this icky stuff all over you?!
You're totes disgusting!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig&rsquo;s
eyes opened slowly. &ldquo;Excuse my disheveled appearance, sister
mine.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">BOOM BOOM
BANG! SNAP! Daisy plowed her fists into the front half of the ship
making a lower support snap. Down came piles of wood landing
everywhere except on Daisy. &ldquo;I'm so flipping sorry!&rdquo; she
exclaimed, on the verge of tears.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A barrel
overturned from the wreck, revealing Luigi. Others followed except

Millennium Star atop the pile. &ldquo;By the power of Eldstar!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The sky
flashed as a blinding bolt came down. There was a spark and soon the
wreckage was on fire, red flames persisting despite the drizzle and
it spread to parts of the ship.</font></p>

heavenward. &ldquo;That wasn't supposed to happen...&rdquo; </font>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No one had

I never saw them enter,&rdquo; Captain Toad spoke up.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo was
into the fields where they once terrorized a few baddies, fixed
towards the sky, captivated by &lsquo;something&rsquo; above with a
pull like force. Up and up they went on the road that spiraled around
Mt. Rugged. Clouds hugged the rock&rsquo;s midsection, closely
shrouding all above it like a curtain waiting for someone to reveal
its secrets of the heavens.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Where
you&rsquo;re head&rsquo;n partner?&rdquo; Whacka, a curious blue
creature that lived up there nice and settled yet isolated, asked the
distracted boo. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The entire
sky was deep black and the closer they got the more insufferable the
wind became. Swept up entirely they were by the strongest unnatural
gale and then it was all over for the little boo..</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What&rsquo;s
going on?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Rub
your white gloved hands together,&rdquo; Jr. Troopa said.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario gave
a start, as did others in the group surrounding the hospital. The
rain falling from the sky was diluted with something dark. While they
were focused on that, around the building came Metal Mario, the
metallic partner of Dr. Mario. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">How
many times you babies wet yourself? Just kidding!&rdquo; After
hacking up a laugh he targeted in on Mario Mario like a guided
missile to deliver a bone cracking handshake to the middle aged man.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oww&hellip;
Glad to see you too I think. Oh Eldstar, what now??&rdquo; Mario
noticed due to a particularity bright lightning flash that a
futuristic helicopter that was parked right where the twice repaired
shed house was. Surprisingly the architect shrugged.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">See,
cooked up a better one anyway,&rdquo; Probabilly explained, pointing
at a structure to the other side of the hospital, a cabin that was
split down the side with one half being old western style and the
other modern and cubist. &ldquo;Couldn't decide what to make it, but
stop that drooling! This place is just for tools and not yer
hootenannies!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Metal
Mario shoved others aside for a better view. &ldquo;Does that place
got a spa? I call it!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Pssst,&rdquo;
went Dr. Mario, clearly embarrassed. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you show
up before?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
should say the same to you, softie. The mix up don&rsquo;t matter
cause point is, ten more patients fresh from the Special World
Hospital are in there. Have fun,&rdquo; Metal Mario went on before
the MKDCU storm the helicopter with him getting caught between them.
His head was buried in the soil while everyone listened closely for
blood curdling screams but got nothing. The squad came right back out
one minute later without a scratch. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
a let down. They were all asleep,&rdquo; Sebastian noted, dragging
his feet.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thanks
again for the help partners, (and for taking out that scary metallic
dude) but first here&rsquo;s our due.&rdquo; Jr. Troopa whistled and
reluctantly, all of the staff lined up to pour the coinage into the
MKDCU&rsquo;s hands to their bafflement. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Did
not we agree to work vol-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Shh!!&rdquo;
James covered Wiggletron&rsquo;s mouth quick.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;m
finally going to Club 64 in say, five more years when Toad Town
rebuilds itself,&rdquo; Richard said, rubbing the coins under his
nose. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Parabilly
nodded. &ldquo;Never thought I&rsquo;d get sick of home!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
call the drivers seat!&rdquo; Sebastian was the first in the new van
they&rsquo;d acquired. The MKDCU were officially done for the day.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">.
Isn&rsquo;t that OUR van they just took?&rdquo; Laki asked, eyeing
the car sprinting away in the mud.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jr. Troopa
pulled him his way. &ldquo;Who gives a hoot? It&rsquo;s over! We did
it ya&rsquo;ll!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Good
work, ya idiot plumber!&rdquo; Bowser slapped Mario to the ground
hard, his signature way of expressing himself which the plumber
didn&rsquo;t really mind given the moment.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And
thank this handsome guy right here!&rdquo; Rou T. pushed Dr. Mario
forward to the latter&rsquo;s bafflement.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
is appropriate,&rdquo; Ludwig had to speak up. &ldquo;The cure would
not be here without his past research on the Mushroom Flu.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thanks,&rdquo;
Dr. Mario replied genuinely. &ldquo;But are you implying you caused
this new outbreak?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And then
in Ludwig&rsquo;s mind a record scratched. A violin string broke. A
bum key was hit. The backing track shut off. The guitar fell from the
strap. Insert some other musical gag here.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Run!&rdquo;
Ludwig scream, causing him and his siblings to run away.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
nearly melted under everyone&rsquo;s collective gaze turning to him.
&ldquo;Uh&hellip;what my brat meant was, er- We all make mistakes
okay? Everyone&rsquo;s alive ain't ya??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
believe em,&rdquo; said Probabilly, back to his janitorial chores on
the porch. &ldquo;And you can use the new shed for one little
hootenanny this time. You&rsquo;d just better clean up after.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">All of a
sudden Bowser really liked that old man, namely because due to that
announcement it no longer seemed like the local hillbillies were
going to knock his block off rodeo style!</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There
you are finally.&rdquo; Agent N found Kylie in the maintenance room
near the parked train on the tracks. Kylie&rsquo;s skin was now
darkened and her eyes pierced through him. &ldquo;-Uh, I was going to
say that I&rsquo;m letting you go. I&rsquo;m about to get Higher HQ
involved and-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
blinked. &ldquo;DO NOT. The ones we seek are very close.&rdquo; She
tilt her head towards the passage out. &ldquo;Be ready right there.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">N just
happened to check his pda. Somehow all systems were now on, even
one&rsquo;s he hadn&rsquo;t touched. Unlike his usual self he wasn&rsquo;t
bothered by this. Not bothered at all.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond and
Zoo met again, this time in the open hallways. &ldquo;Updates? Yes?&rdquo;
Bond held a grenade snatched from Spy Guy, tossing it a short
distance and catching it.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah
because I did your job. Where&rsquo;s this??&rdquo; Zoo excitedly
shoved that map in Bond&rsquo;s face. Shy Guy&rsquo;s Toy box formed
a circle with the colored stations with a center area defined as
&lsquo;launch site&rsquo;.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hmm.
We should be able to access it from any of the stations but let us
try the red. While you were doing my job, I did yours! We can leave
from there after launch.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo rolled
the map back up. &ldquo;You know I did have to deal with people
anyway, and it wasn&rsquo;t pretty.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond lead
the way, carefully rounding corners. &ldquo;At least you did not mean
it. Yes, I know it was Waldo, Sonny, and Lt. Stone. You are that
transparent.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Apparently,
except when I&rsquo;m trying to be..&rdquo; he replied before
accidentally bumping into his companion.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Up ahead
were faint red lasers stretching from one end of passageway to the
other. Some were still but others periodically moved around. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Neat,
this is like in a movie!&rdquo; Zoo was pulled back before he got
diced. The lasers shifted their position, making the previous safe
space impossible to cross. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Cover
your ears.&rdquo; Bond&rsquo;s grenade roll under the lasers with
only a hair&rsquo;s width to spare. It blew up on the other side,
taking the door, the wall, and the security system with it. Bond
noticed Zoo speaking to him quite eagerly about something but without
sound. It occurred to him then that he forgot to cover his own ears..</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
lean back in Rou T.&rsquo;s La-Z-Boy, staring at the drab hospital
front lobby that was still torn up from earlier events. It was night.
The patients were all tucked in bed for the slow recovery and
volenteers had packed up. He knew Dr. Toadley and crew did, most of
the gang members, and even Dr. Mario, except Metal Mario who wanted
some of that hootenanny action. Or just more alcohol. Bowser himself
skipped the party so it was just chill time. It was weird, but he
felt kind of good about things. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah,
Peach. I used to be a carpenter once. I can get your castle rebuilt
in a fraction of the cost of some licensed professional!&rdquo; a
voice near said.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Tee
hee, you&rsquo;re always so thoughtful&hellip;&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What&rsquo;s
wrong?&rdquo; Mario asked, entering the lobby to notice Bowser
staring.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
tried to play it off cool. &ldquo;-Nothing.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Outside, a
figure approached the hospital. Mario watched them come closer before
he sprint to their aid. Shivering harshly the green plumber trudged
in the rain before Mario scooped him up. He knew Luigi had trek
towards the mountain looking for Boo, but it was now so dark it was
like Mt. Rugged disappeared and Luigi was alone.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bro.
What happened? Where was your friend??&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
grabbed on to his brother with jittery hands, his eyes clouded and
empty. His voice came out with the softness of the wind. &ldquo;...It&rsquo;s
here.&rdquo;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They were
getting closer to red station when like a clap of thunder, something
black and spidery that resembled lightning crawled from around the
steel air vents above to bring them down. Bond and Zoo had to dodge
forward into the room ahead to avoid the collapse which was actually
the maintenance room.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">OUR
TARGETS HAVE ARRIVED.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond felt
the hair on the back of his neck sizzle as a flame jet shot just
inches from above. Without sunglasses on it nearly blinded him to see
that Agent N was wielding it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take him while you
find Kylie,&rdquo; he told Zoo through gritted teeth. He himself
threw something grenade like across the ground to fake out N. The
fire stream halt just long enough for him to make a move.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo went
straight for the train were he thought he heard her but there was no
koopa reporter there, only her weird little puppet of him. It was
hand stitched and, wow, no one had ever done that for him so in a
morbid way he really liked it enough to take along. That was a
mistake. It disintegrated in his hand, spewing dark matter in a
floating form like a fog. Some got down his throat and he coughed,
opening his eyes to see the whole world growing dimmer.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">HAND
OVER YOUR BELL.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Where
are you?!&rdquo; Zoo blindly bumped into an object.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie bent
to his level. &ldquo;RIGHT HERE, MORTAL!&rdquo; She sent him flying
into the train. She made some of the roof fall on him too, resulting
in sheet rock falling and pipes bursting. She caused so much damage
some of the outside rain water could trickle in.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
knew it&rsquo;d come to this.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Agent N
punched Bond with the hand not on the flame thrower. They were
tumbling around on the other side of the room near the cage but Bond
refused to let up the tug o war, even with his black eye. Agent N
step back peddle on the durian, the object Bond had actually tossed
earlier, losing his balance and falling with his back against the
cage. Bond thought he had an opening and lunged forward but N
expertly kicked the fruit upwards, spiking Bond in the face. Once
fruit was swatted to the floor the next thing in his face was the
barrel of the flame thrower. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">T'as
pas de couilles!&rdquo; A silenced pistol was now aimed it at his
roommate. Bond made a dire realization. He was the one aiming the
cold steel!</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
think so, huh?? I will turn you to ashes right now, agent!!&rdquo;
Agent N hiss, tensed and eyes dilated. His rigid stance said that he
was ready to incinerate yet the wavering of his voice conveyed
something else. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
opened her palm revealing a blue wick. She motioned upwards and the
entire train lifted and moved to the side, revealing only rubble. She
step closer to make sure Zoo was underneath where she could finally
acquire her prized bell, in fact, after lifting a ceiling panel,
there it was! The glowing yellow noise maker was just laying on top
of the rock. She dove for it only for her hand to be caught by
something.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
revealed himself. &ldquo;Try again, sis. Heh heh!&rdquo; He twisted
her arm and flung her body across the floor, sliding all the way near
whatever staring contest was going on at that cage.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Go
forth old chap,&rdquo; Anti-Guy calmly spoke in an unexpectedly posh
English tone as he held Agent N against the cage by the necktie. The
yoshi wasn&rsquo;t resisting, only standing normally but he chose to
let the dark shy guy think he was really doing something.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">N rubbed
his head. &ldquo;Am I dreaming? We&rsquo;re back at home, right?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond
dropped the gun. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to say no, Jeremy. All of us,
even myself for a moment, were being exploited!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">B-by
what?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That!&rdquo;
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond moved
just as Kylie&rsquo;s shell bang up against the cage with a huge
clang. She sprung up, sending forth black lightning that dart across
the air at Zoo. He vanished just in time. Her head snap Bond&rsquo;s
way with her eyes flashing. She bent to throw the durian at him with
super human strength but failed. She tried again but the fruit
refused to stay in her hands.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">WHAT
IS GOING ON?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
distraction.&rdquo; Zoo appeared behind her, hitting her with full
force of his death ray that threatened to split her molecules apart.
She fell and from her pores oozed a black mist that form into a cloud
above.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">THIS
FORM IS TOO WEAK. I WILL DESTROY YOU THIS WAY.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The matter
dissipate into the walls. Right away the lights went red in the room
and alarms blared. ~Poro 13 Launch Initiated~</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond
pressed his ear to the wall. &ldquo;Eldstar, she&rsquo;s going to
prevent the launch to the moon!&rdquo; He ran for the red station on
his own.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She?
Kylie or that dark star person??&rdquo; Zoo rolled Kyle&rsquo;s body
to find that she still breathed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Agent N
stood over Kylie before carrying her in his arms. &ldquo;What was
Jelectro talking about with the moon? There&rsquo;s no moon up
there.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Excuse
me?&rdquo; Zoo questioned, getting agitated.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Don&rsquo;t
you guys know?&rdquo; N said as other survivors were pouring in, no
matter how unlikely.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
concerned looking Spy Guy climbed over the rubble from the hallway
Kylie had destroyed. With him was 999 and even Agent Toad on a
stretcher who survived because 999 was an army medic. The surgery
wasn&rsquo;t pretty, but thwomps did lack arms...</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No
one told me about a rocket,&rdquo; Spy Guy said. &ldquo;And were are
you going to launch to? The void above?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What?!&rdquo;
Zoo made everyone flinch before running off where Bond went.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Agent N
sigh, still carrying Kylie who slob on his shoulder. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
follow. Go go go!&rdquo; He stop. &ldquo;Oh, and let Rodney out,
whoever has a key.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Good
show!&rdquo; Anti-Guy replied quietly.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
lifted his head from the reception desk. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
office is closed, plumbers!...&rdquo; Bowser watched as Mario sat
Luigi down in some chairs. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s gotten into him?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A glass
jug began to vibrate on the desk. It shook until it fell and
shattered on the floor. The sound of rain pouring transformed into a
low roar then in the distance they began to hear a series of low
thuds in the distance. Mario ran outside in time to catch sight of a
yoshi carriage engulfed in flames. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;m
on fire!&rdquo; screamed Laki to his right.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The noki
nurse dropped to the ground and rolled. A random doogan passerby
splashed some water to little effect. Mario ran over to pat out the
flames with his own natural fire resistance and soon the nurse was
blackened but safe.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">How
did these wild fires start so quick?&rdquo; Mario tried to ask.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thank
you but no time to talk!&rdquo; Laki ran right back into town were
every other building burned. Giving the skyline a warm orange glow
were rows of settlements up in flames, houses, shops, tents, and even
the new shed house. The entire town was out on the streets in panic.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
nearly knocked Mario down rushing his way. &ldquo;I think that
monster is back!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Huh?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Listen.
The black star monster, the thing that made us mute this afternoon?
It was flammable and that&rsquo;s how we survived. Now notice
something wrong?&rdquo; Yoshi waved his hand in the oily substance
that continued to rain. &ldquo;The fire and rain are working
together. We can&rsquo;t put this stuff out if it combusts.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Mr.
Mario!&rdquo; Captain Toad ran up wheezing. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
if they can make it!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Who?&rdquo;
Mario demand.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Captain
Toad&rsquo;s voice became a hardly audible squeak. &ldquo;Mrs.
Toadette, that desk lady, Jr. Troopa, Daisy&hellip; and Mr. T-toad!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi&rsquo;s
eyes went wide. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going back into town!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi!&rdquo;
Mario called out, but his long time buddy disappeared in the crowd.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
hardly recognized Metal Mario next. His silver body was now a reddish
orange. &ldquo;Sup, cry baby. No wait. I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m not
usually this insensitive. Oh wait, yes I am. Well I&rsquo;m going in
for a cold shower. Can&rsquo;t save people from burning houses if my
skin can also give em third degree burns. Later...&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Now it was
all up to- Wait, it was always up to Mario, and he&rsquo;d step up to
the challenge like any other time. He had to do something drastic. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Where
are you going?&rdquo; he asked Bowser who walked by. Mario must have
daydreamed for just a second, yet this was exactly who he needed.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Finding
my kids,&rdquo; Bowser said over his shoulder. &ldquo;You know. To
fight this thing.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
caught up with him. &ldquo;Good. It&rsquo;s up to us anyway because,
well, it&rsquo;s about us right?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
kept walking ahead with his face forward because he didn&rsquo;t want
Mario to see that he couldn&rsquo;t help grinning from ear to ear.
They soon found the koopa kids near the original airship landing
spot.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Vater,
I expected you here. We salvaged these items.&rdquo; Ludwig stood
before much armory salvaged from their airship which was only a
skeletal frame at this point. &ldquo;We await further instructions.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Uh,
well. Use the same old same old tactics. Blow the heck up whatever&rsquo;s
up there!.&rdquo; Bowser command. Mario braced himself.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boom!
Boom! Bang! Boom! Bang! Bang! Eight fiery cannonballs shot upwards
simultaneously, leaving a long snake like trail in their wake.
Everyone spotted the little disturbances in the clouds where they&rsquo;d
fired before the &lsquo;sky&rsquo; retaliated. Down came a gush of
flames that knocked all of the koopa kids back. Right before the
molten mix hit Mario and Bowser, time seemingly stop for them both.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Aww
crap, not my best idea. If this was gonna be it I would have been
nice if Peach was around. Any last words? Mine is that since we were
in an alliance I technically won today. That&rsquo;s right plumber.
Besides, I did all the work,&rdquo; Bowser added with a playful
nudge.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
thought for a moment, though in reality this happened instantly. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t think this would really be it.. I&rsquo;m just glad I
did right thing I guess. My last words will be-&rdquo; Mario did a V
sign with his hands, cheering up instantly. &ldquo;Thanks for playing
my game!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">FLOOSH.
Swallowed were both eternal rivals by the greedy hand above. The
blast finally beat the doomship into a flat pile of rubble, but from
the flames arose&hellip; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
Millennium Star. See! Alive, glowing, radiant! &ldquo;Ho ho, what has
transpired here?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi used
the last of his energy to crawl beneath the radiating star with his
head upwards. &ldquo;I just&hellip; want you...to know&hellip; I&hellip;
believed&hellip;.&rdquo; The green plumber&rsquo;s eyes closed
slowly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Millennium
Star began to glow brighter. Off he went in a brilliant flash.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The red
station was compact, blisteringly hot, and rumbling. Bond stumbled
upon a ladder leading to a crawlspace above, also a locked door. He
glanced upwards. &ldquo;You are the dark star. Yes?&rdquo; He waited
for a response. He got one, but not the one he expected.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jelectro!-&rdquo;
Zoo choked on the rest of his words. His face was entirely wet from
sweat and tears. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do this anymore!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">GIVE
IT UP. ALL OF YOU AND THE BELL HOLDER WILL PERISH HERE,&rdquo; the
deep voice boomed, making those entering the room yelp.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Who
was that?!&rdquo; 999 shriek.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Agent N
pushed him and others ahead anyway. &ldquo;You all take that ladder
out. You hold her.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Spy Guy
was given Kylie to hold, to his dismay. &ldquo;Agent, what are you
going to-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
is an order, agents!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Evacuated
were everyone but Bond, Zoo, and N, the last of which went into the
room connecting the red station to the rocket&rsquo;s secret chamber.
Right after, noxious fumes and smoke pour into the red station. While
the intercom spout out error messages, the vibrations in the room
grew in intensity like an earthquake.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond
grabbed onto the wall for support. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re running out of
time. I can fly this myself if you give me the bell.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No
no no! I can&rsquo;t like, lose you!&rdquo; Zoo paused. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t lose you bro&hellip;&rdquo; he repeated, easing back into
himself. &ldquo;I might as well own up for my mistakes. This day was
pretty awful but pretty great too because of you. Outside of all of
this bell stuff, why did you really want to be my friend though? I
mean at first?&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond took
a deep breath. &ldquo;I am tormented constantly by accidental
intrusions on the thoughts of others, it is why I must keep busy. I
noticed the first time we met was.. different. But, that&rsquo;s not
the only reason, mon ami. I actually like you.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
couldn&rsquo;t do much more than smile really awkwardly. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We&rsquo;re
losing power! Come on!&rdquo; Agent N shout from inside that chamber.
With a gas mask on he man the computers, enduring hordes of technical
glitches.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The rocket
chamber within had smooth but rapidly cracking concrete walls with
LEDs lit from top to bottom, reflecting on the silvery space age
looking rocket that stood 100 feet tall. The four engines above them,
each the size of a large car were already hot enough to distort the
air around them and the general ambient temperature of the area was
nearly unbearable. Despite this, Zoo phased them both right through,
where the inside was breathable again. Zoo looked around astonished.
Meters filled the interior and bucket seats were mounted vertically.
Bond hit something that officially made the take off ready.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~10,
9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1! ~</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">An
innocuous suburb above HQ caved in on itself when the hatch buried
deep below opened up for the launch.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">AND
NOW PERISH.&rdquo; The voice returned. The rocket became coated
entirely in dark matter and stalled, not wanting to lift from the
ground.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; N growl. He wasn&rsquo;t sure how Bond
was fairing with his end of the controls but he remotely increased
the power to the point where his observation room spark suddenly and
lost power. He now couldn&rsquo;t see the radars but with the
tremendous noise he knew it was a success. Rising like a black spire
from the Earth was the rocket, trudging forward through the stormy
conditions outside.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And
now I have you Dark Star!&rdquo; said Geno, a ball of light hovering
outside. While locked out of HQ he&rsquo;d gotten back up waiting
just outside of Earth. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re being deported baby!&rdquo;
Geno fused with the rocket for a moment before he was flicked off
like a flea.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">YOU
WERE FOOLISH TO TRY YOUNGSTER. THE BELL HOLDER WILL PERISH NOW!&rdquo;
said the &lsquo;rocket&rsquo;. Once again the stall problem returned.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ho
ho! Need a hand with this?&rdquo; Behind Geno&rsquo;s back was
Millennium Star.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
think?! Where&rsquo;d you come from anyway? Oh never mind. Follow my
lead.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Together
they combined to attack the rocket&rsquo;s black coating, this time
reducing the dark star&rsquo;s influence to the measly but defiant
tip with their combined effort. Up and up the rocket tore through
gloomy thick clouds and ever closer to the void until it disappeared,
out of their realm. The Earth was free of Doom Reverb.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">When Agent
N climbed out of the manhole, behind him was a crater and destroyed
neighborhood from the launched. Once his feet were on dry land he
ripped the gas mask off and walked around for a bit in the rain,
completely numb. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Over
here!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He glanced
up at his team under the roof of a fuel station. All remaining were
there, even Kylie who was on the ground leaning on a gas pump with a
blanket over her. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">N,&rdquo;
Spy Guy repeated. &ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Agent N
nodded. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Good.
I know your next meeting will be hectic with the case studies and the
rehiring you&rsquo;ll have to do and the damage reports and-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Agent N
stopped him there. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be. Will that civilian
recover fine? Yes? Then that&rsquo;s great.&rdquo; He let his
loosened tie hit the wet concrete. &ldquo;I quit.&rdquo;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Right
outside the Star Temple were the usual things really, as long as
everyone forgot about the blinking leg bands they wore and the star
officers standing around on the property because that wasn&rsquo;t
weird or anything...</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
know we were guilty to an extent, but is not your time better spent
elsewhere?&rdquo; Skolar noted, on a bench reading a book.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
has't been toldeth to remain alert of a passing criminal,&rdquo; the
guard replied.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Meanwhile
Klevar was excessively refreshing the Toad Town message boards on a
portable version of his granite computer before Misstar marched up to
him.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You&rsquo;re
always on that thing. Look up sometimes. See something beautiful-
like me!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Or
this shooting star! How lovely!&rdquo; Mamar chimed, setting down her
knitting supplies. Darting across the sky was a black speck spinning
wildly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Eldstar
stopped stacking cards on a table to squint at it, thinking that dark
star was very familiar while the star guards hanging around went on
hot pursuit of the comet. Not that he minded, but they forgot one,
the guy that was coming his way.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Eldstar?
I&rsquo;m back. Where&rsquo;s &lsquo;it&rsquo;?&rdquo; Geno asked in
low voice, wearing a fake nose and eyeglasses to hide his identity to
the police.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Far back
in an almost forgotten portion of the Star Temple sat a machine,
square shaped and wheezing from age yet running with green encrypted
texts patterned across the otherwise black screen. It controlled then
and now but only if a condition was satisfied. With a simple command
UTC on Earth lingered for a second too long at 23:59 of April 4,
2016&hellip;.</font></p>

</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It was a
normal early morning at the Mario residence. Luigi leaned up in bed
and stretched. Mario snored loudly in the background as usual. It was
6 AM. What was the on agenda? Oh right he thought, he was going to
play Daisy and Toad with Mario in a tennis game. Why his brother
scheduled back to back weekend events he didn&rsquo;t know- Over a
decade in the Kingdom (somehow starting at the age of twenty-four)
and he still hadn&rsquo;t adapted to Mario&rsquo;s frantic nature.
(And he felt he&rsquo;d only gained a year. But the time differences
compared to the Real World was another story.)</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Still
worth it,&rdquo; he thought out loud. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t have it
any other way.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A loud
buzz went off to his side coming from Mario&rsquo;s phone on the
nightstand. It was quickly followed by an obnoxious ringtone of World
1-1.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach!
Don&rsquo;t say yes to him!&rdquo; Mario flung the covers over his
head, eyes bulk wide.</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
have one new voicemail.&rsquo;*Beep*</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey,
pipes for brains, wake up call! Bwa ha ha!&rdquo; The Mario brothers
could hear a loud &lsquo;Koopa Symphony&rsquo; in the background of
Bowser&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Ah hem. But anyway, if we lose our match
today, you&rsquo;re toast! Oh and tell the Princess I&rsquo;ll be
looking my best today. Just for her!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi lay
back in bed with a huff. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lastly.
Umm, well. What&rsquo;s the recipe for that Couples Cake again? You
know, the one only friends eat together? *Mumbling noises were
heard*- Kamek, no this isn&rsquo;t Mario- *mumbling noises* Umm,
gotta go. Keep that cellphone smokin&rsquo;! Wait, that don&rsquo;t
make sense. Whatever. See ya, plumber breath.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">*Beep*
&lsquo;End of message. You have no new messages. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
didn&rsquo;t want to play anyway. My tennis elbow was acting up,&rdquo;
Luigi said quickly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let me mess up your whole
frenemy thing.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario sat
up with his legs over the edge of the bed, dialing someone&rsquo;s
number. &ldquo;Cut that out, little brother. I&rsquo;d forgotten
Bowser mentioned that yesterday. Too bad for him. No koopa&rsquo;s
breaking up the Marios.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...Hello?
Yeah, this is Bowser. Who are you???&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
know,&rdquo; Mario reply on his end.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh,
you! Gwah ha ha! Liked my message? Got chills down your spine?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Actually
I&rsquo;m sticking with my original plans, but feel free to watch
from the sidelines and sulk on the bleachers like you normally do!&rdquo;
Mario hung up when the line suddenly went dead. &ldquo;..Oh well.
He&rsquo;s a big koopa, he&rsquo;ll manage.&rdquo; Mario got up from
bed still in white undershirt and boxers. &ldquo;Now what&rsquo;s
going to be for breakfast?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kamek
ducked as a matte black object shot over his head and cracked against
the nearest wall. Bowser stomp his feet hard, jostling all of the
objects near him, his piles of books including but not limited to
&lsquo;Pride and Prejudice&rsquo;, iron barbells, Dark Land territory
maps, a mug of black coffee, and lastly his prize framed photograph
of Mario smiling cheerily while doing a v sign. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">How
dare Mario reject ME!&hellip; Erm, that came out wrong,&rdquo; Bowser
said with a flush.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kamek kept
his head down. &ldquo;I think you meant exactly what you said, your
nastiness...&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
stormed out of his throne room to the castle&rsquo;s bulletin board.
He had in hand a print out Iggy made for him a while back with the
text: &lsquo;Friendship ended with Mario&rsquo;. He just had to post
it to feel better but he&rsquo;d need to clear some space. There were
help wanted signs because of the constant need, Lemmy&rsquo;s vibrant
coloring sheets, Ludwig shamelessly promoting independent concerts,
Larry trying to advertise his DJ services, Morton attempting to have
a &lsquo;word of the week&rsquo;, Wendy selling Avon, Iggy looking
for someone female in the castle that would date him, and absolutely
nothing from Roy because he was illiterate..</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ah,
perfect.&rdquo; Bowser ripped off an innocuous blank sheet of paper
then glanced at his own addition, seething anger boiling up inside
all over again. As he crumbled the blank sheet in his palm, he
noticed ink rubbing off on his hand. He unfolded the paper slightly
to see words appearing from thin air.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">To
all Koopalings:&rdquo; it said at the top. &ldquo;The plan, should
you choose to cooperate, and you should or face disciplinary action,
is to invade Peach&rsquo;s castle on this date: Friday April 3, 2016
which is today, so pay attention plebeians. Yes that is you! Take a
note on your silly little phone if you must!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Now,&rdquo;
the mysterious paper continued, &ldquo;By the later half of today our
garbage man underling who is so insignificant I shall not name him
should have distributed our tainted soda cans in Toad Town to force
mass chaos that will persuade the Princess to finally surrender. PS:
DO NOT TELL KING DAD. As Dark Land&rsquo;s commander in chief it is
time I take matters in my own hand. Oh, and Bowser is dumb!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And at the
very bottom: &ldquo;Your leader: Ludwig Von Koopa.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The heat
sensitive paper got darker from Bowser&rsquo;s rage, eventually
wrinkling and combusting into thin powder. Ludwig, dressed in morning
robes came around the corner with some tea in hand.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">LUDWIG?!?&rdquo;
the entire castle heard at once. As the young military commander&rsquo;s
ceramic mug shattered on the floor, Bowser did a &lsquo;come here&rsquo;
gesture...</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
Koopa the reporter was at the Mushroom Press this early morning and
getting nowhere with her current story. She shot her hands in the air
in desperation. &ldquo;Time for the back up scoop on-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Your
mother?&rdquo; Mitch Toad, her smirking rival was right across in his
space.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie shot
him an eye dagger just as the new guy was coming inside the building.
The mysterious newbie dashed from the door to their cubicle on the
opposite side of the press before Kylie called them out.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sit
still for a second so I can meet ya.&rdquo; Kylie got up and offered
her hand.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The dark
boo spun her way slowly. &ldquo;Uh, hey.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
smiled at their voice being a bit gruffer than expected. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
Kylie if ya don&rsquo;t know. Ace reporter. You?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
Diddley,&rdquo; Mitch butt in, not glancing over his shoulder as he
clacked away writing whatever usual &lsquo;trash&rsquo; for the
Mushroom Enquirer. &ldquo;What are you even doing here, dude?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
grinned hard. &ldquo;Bro, maybe I want to be a garbage man AND
journalist! I thought this was all a dream but you remember too?
Cool. Don&rsquo;t worry about &lsquo;that thing&rsquo;. I dumped them
somewhere else&hellip; I still dent your car with my bike though.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mitch spun
that chair around so fast it almost fell over. &ldquo;Seriously?&rdquo;
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
stifled a laugh. She didn&rsquo;t get what the heck anyone was
talking about, but as long as Mitch was suffering...</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
called the &lsquo;Flutter effect&rsquo;, right? Its the small things
that can break the space time continuum,&rdquo; Zoo continued. &ldquo;So,
wanna hang out?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">In a flash
Kylie was ready to go, camera and all. &ldquo;Right on, brother!
Let&rsquo;s hit the tennis stadium and I&rsquo;ll show ya how this
reporting business is done, unlike Greeny over there!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Shut
up!&rdquo; Mitch spat, though when Kylie left he wasn&rsquo;t upset
at all.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">At 8 AM in
the morning, this was a bright sunny day in Toad Town with crowds
starting to gather for the tournament in advance. Luigi thought he
was showing up early, guess not!</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad was
at a stand selling stuff. &ldquo;Sup, homeboy. Wanna try my hand spun
shroom shakes?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi took
the blue cup that was offered and gulp it down. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
pretty good!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thanks
loser. Uh, I mean Luigi. I gotta break my random insult habit,&rdquo;
he said as Mario and Yoshi were approaching. &ldquo;You two! Come get
a sample while it lasts because I&rsquo;m going pro.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You..are?&rdquo;
Mario said with some doubt.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They&rsquo;ll
will have no choice but to offer me a contract after I win today with
Daisy.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
rolled his eyes. &ldquo;Getting ahead of yourself are we?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Actually
I appreciate the enthusiasm,&rdquo; Mario nudged his sibling.
&ldquo;Remember, Luigi? In our last match vs Yoshi and Shy Guy half
the audience were snoozing!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
turned to Yoshi, hesitating to say something confrontational. &ldquo;Well
some people, uh, might have napped for a bit? I think? Maybe?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
crossed his arms as he walked off. &ldquo;Shy Guy and I had a
strategy! A strategy!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Later
Mario was chatting with Peach about how normal this day felt,
completely unlike yesterday where something felt off. Oh well, he was
glad it passed..</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You&rsquo;re
Mario, right?!&rdquo; Mario heard a lowish voice call out to him
while heading to the locker rooms. It was a dark boo wearing a ball
cap and holding a little camera. &ldquo;Got anything to say? Call me
Sue, by the way.&rdquo; &lsquo;Sue&rsquo; gave Mario a rather firm
handshake.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
don&rsquo;t have a story much. This isn&rsquo;t a grudge match or a
charity event. Just know I&rsquo;m going to play my best and I won&rsquo;t
let anything stop us. Not even Bowser!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sue stared
at Mario for a second intrigued. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s perfect,&rdquo;
he muttered oddly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
reach the locker room with duffle bag in tow. He pulled out his
trusty old blue racket that had seen better days, especially with
parts of it chipping off. Luigi handed over a spare green racket
right away.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thanks
Luigi.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
no prob-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-That&rsquo;s
not all. I was just thinking that we&rsquo;re more roommates than
brothers these days. When&rsquo;s the last time we hung out and it
wasn&rsquo;t because of an adventure? Sometimes its alright to just
have a normal day.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
nodded. &ldquo;...Sure. Where are you going with this?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
sighed. &ldquo;Never mind then. Brothers before Koopas.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Now
that I can agree with. Promise to not back peddle on my toes like
last time.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No
guarantees!&rdquo; Mario swung around the spare in the air. &ldquo;Now
let&rsquo;s get out there and hope Toad and Daisy haven&rsquo;t broke
into a fight. You know how they can hardly stand each other.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lakitu saw
the brothers enter the court and blew an air horn. &ldquo;Alright.
Everybody&rsquo;s here,&rdquo; he said in a bored fashion. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There was
a decent size crowd on exactly one side of the stadium but none on
the left. Toad and Daisy were already on their side of the court
looking competent and itching to play. Toad even had a flowery band
on his head that must have been borrowed from Daisy. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thwack!</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Caught off
guard, Mario was whacked in the face with a tennis ball.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">For
the LAST time, first serve Mario!&rdquo; Lakitu said through a
megaphone.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bro,
are you alright?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah
homeboy. Wait until we beat you to turn red.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Good
one!&rdquo; Daisy high five Toad. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
picked up the ball, ready to make the first serve. Toad lunged for
the ball and knocked it back but he continued to roll all the way
into a reporter that was absentmindedly standing too close to the
white line. Luigi return the ball in the open gap Toad left but Daisy
did a back flip into position. The ball was lobbed right in the
Marios&rsquo; center court.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
got it!&rdquo; Luigi called out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It took
everything Mario had to not jump in the way, but he stay put against
the net. Luigi sent the ball flying with a purple fiery trail pass
Mario and right down the court. It went so fast past Daisy that she
spun like a top off the field to collide into another reporter while
Toad stared blankly.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">15-Love,&rdquo;
Lakitu announced. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario pat
his brother on the back. &ldquo;Great job. Now we just have to do
that over&hellip; and over&hellip; and over.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
stopped smiling. &ldquo;I just remembered why I don&rsquo;t like
tennis.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Then the
brothers turned to the sky to see a Koopa Battleship approaching from
the West. Its drone of engines grew louder and louder as some of the
crowd instinctively ran.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Cover
her,&rdquo; Mario said under his breath. Luigi immediately verified
Peach was okay. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">ATTENTION
MARIO LOSERS!&rdquo; Bowser barked from some sort of intercom as the
airship halt one hundred feet or so right above the stadium. &ldquo;PREPARE
TO FACE THE ULTIMATE&hellip;. No no no no! DON&rsquo;T TOUCH THAT-!!&rdquo;
The airship dropped right onto the left stadium seats in a horrible
crash. Mario shielded his eyes from the pillar of fire. Concrete and
metal from steel benches flew into the sky.. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
my,&rdquo; Peach exclaimed, materializing at Mario&rsquo;s side with
Luigi.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">While what
was left of the airship began to burn and black smoke spread, six of
the koopalings and Junior frantically rushed out on the tennis field.
Junior clung straight onto the net sobbing. &ldquo;King Dad was
yelling at me! Make him stop yelling at me!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That&rsquo;s
why six year olds don&rsquo;t drive, retard,&rdquo; Larry snickered,
even though he couldn&rsquo;t drive either at fifteen because he lost
his permit.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Don&rsquo;t
say that!!&rdquo; Wendy rebuked right away.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There&rsquo;s
no harm in being a person who cannot be trusted operating a motorized
vehicle. Or anything with wheels really..&rdquo; Iggy added, missing
the point.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Check
me out!&rdquo; Lemmy rolled all over the court with his self made
tennis ball roller blades. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Roy was
stealing a wallet someone had left. &ldquo;Score!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Morton
meanwhile was picking up a well worn yet expensive gold ring on the
ground. &ldquo;Everyone look here! Quickly! Expediently!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thanks,
dweeb.&rdquo; Roy snatched it out of his hands.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Roy
has a girl ring!&rdquo; Lemmy teased.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No
I don&rsquo;t!!&rdquo; Blushing, Roy shoved it Wendy&rsquo;s way. She
didn&rsquo;t appreciate the sexism, but being a spoiled brat won over
her ethics so she accepted happily.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Uh,
guys?&rdquo; Mario interrupt. Luigi, Toad, Daisy, and even Yoshi had
his back. &ldquo;Where are your leaders?&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The smoke
from the airships open door turned white, revealed a second later to
actually be fire extinguisher. Ludwig step out next. &ldquo;Vater!
The vessel will no longer combust!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
shoved Ludwig out the doorway a second later, making him tumble down
the bleachers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m standing right next to you, stupid.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
know you are!!! And would you please speak up?!&rdquo; Peeved, Ludwig
got up.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
marched right up to Mario. He didn&rsquo;t even glance at Peach, he
was that serious. &ldquo;Moustache. Listen up and listen up REAL
GOOD!!!-&rdquo; He glanced around dumbly, especially upon seeing the
score. &ldquo;Wait, where is everyone? Did we show too early? Aww,
crap. We weren&rsquo;t supposed to arrive until mid to late game to
terrorize you losers!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
wanted to cancel our game?!&rdquo; Toad exclaim like it was super
serious, but everyone else was looking relieved.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh..
just that dear&hellip; I&rsquo;m glad you weren&rsquo;t planning
anything harmful,&rdquo; Peach remarked a little too soon.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
bared his fangs. &ldquo;I tell ya what, hotness. Since the show&rsquo;s
over I think we will beat ya&rsquo;ll after all! Physically! Ya know,
real assault. Or something&hellip;.GET THEM!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
whipped back towards Bowser&rsquo;s hoards of children when eight
tennis balls bounced his way, some on mark others wildly off. Bowser
now held a purple emblem racket and his children had some trainer
rackets stolen from the nearest supply closet. Their side of the
court had the metal grate with the stadium&rsquo;s supply of tennis
balls in it!</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Batter
up!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Actually
that is baseball. Softball. Stickball!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Roy
&lsquo;practiced&rsquo; by whacking Morton with the racket.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Enough!!!
Let us attack the plumber!!&rdquo; Ludwig yelled for no reason,
obviously deaf from this morning.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
prepared for another tennis ball barrage when he was shielded by
Yoshi. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario,
we got you covered.&rdquo; Yoshi deflected the balls with a trainer
racket. Luigi was to his left doing the same and now Peach even held
a racket on his right. Daisy was pulling up in the rear double
wielding rackets and Toad was charging up to the net like a warrior.
Or a crazy person. Likely both. Mario swiftly grab his racket from
the ground and began to play.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;m
hit!&rdquo; Lemmy froze in place and waited for someone to unfreeze
him.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Keep
playing,&rdquo; Bowser growled. He stay in the back of center court.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Knock
out the midget first!&rdquo; Larry tried and failed to hit Toad who
was zipping around close to the net.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Don&rsquo;t
say that word either!&rdquo; Wendy snapped. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi was
so experienced playing that he almost zoned out. &quot;..You know in
the 90s I could have gotten a condo in Toad Town for cheap. But I was
like, noooo. Now I couldn't afford to if I wanted&hellip; Do I sound
old now?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yes,
grandpa,&quot; Larry replied.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
expertly smack him in the face with a ball. &ldquo;Oops, it slipped.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
can&rsquo;t keep this up for long!&rdquo; Peach narrowly dodged the
ball heading her way which instead hit Mario.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
agree,&rdquo; moan Mario, covered in bruises. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Guys,
we have to aim for the source. Or, Bowser I mean. See him in the
back?&rdquo; Daisy squint to see past the mass of koopalings.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Good
idea, homegirl. Chaaaaaaaarge!!!&rdquo; Completely out of turn, Toad
hopped over the fence past Morton, Lemmy, Wendy, and Ludwig near the
net, past Larry who was struggling to not cry like a wimp from what
Yoshi had done, past Iggy who had headphones on, and past Roy who was
distracted by Daisy&rsquo;s athletic outfit.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Where
do you think you&rsquo;re going?!&rdquo; Bowser Junior unexpectedly
knocked Toad down. &ldquo;Just sit right there! I&rsquo;m gonna shoot
stuff!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
turned to see his youngest son manning the practice ball shooter and
aiming it at Toad. The machine&rsquo;s barrel budged from the
improper air pressure used and the tennis balls stuffed in it. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Nooooo!&rdquo;
Bowser abandoned the game and rushed over just as there was a huge
explosion. Both teams paused as Bowser and his son were blown high
into the sky, right up and over the stadium&rsquo;s walls on the
right side.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">RETREAT!&rdquo;
Ludwig and the koopalings shuffled quickly out of the entrance.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad got
up without a scratch. &ldquo;That was totally my plan. Let&rsquo;s
play again.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Even Daisy
was giving him the side eye. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
a weird day,&rdquo; Yoshi lament, beginning to call his girlfriend
Birdo to share the news.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
wouldn&rsquo;t say that. Sometimes, a day is just a day.&rdquo; Mario
stared into the sky.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Outside
the court, few were hanging around just in case the game continued
after the intermission..</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
hope my Luigi is okay,&rdquo; one little boo wearing a t-shirt with
Luigi&rsquo;s face on it muttered over and over. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And
I hope I can find my ring mixed up in there,&rdquo; Kylie added,
tapping her foot constantly as she stood around. It gave her good and
bad memories alike, from the person who gave it to her but was
essential none the less.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A shadow
covered everyone that grew and grew and then- WHAM! Everyone but
Kylie ran as Bowser plopped down flat in the grass. Junior fell into
a nearby tree with rustling, falling leaves and twigs, before getting
caught up by the straps on his Koopa Scouts backpack.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
snapped a photo. &ldquo;Now this is a scoop!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Step
away from Vater,&rdquo; Ludwig growl in between his out of shape
wheezing.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah.
Give him space, people! Gosh! Or just back the heck up,&rdquo; Wendy
added.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser&rsquo;s
eyes fluttered open and the first thing he saw was someone wearing
pink. &ldquo;Peach!! You&rsquo;d better not say yes to HIM-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
titular princess slapped him hard. &ldquo;You are banned from this
stadium,&rdquo; she spoke triumphantly. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-And
stay away!&rdquo; Mario shout at Bowser and his kid&rsquo;s backs
while they were kicked to the curb. With that the remaining lingerers
thinned out, another Bowser &lsquo;plot&rsquo; foiled by Mario and
company! Back out where the food stands were, everything was normal.
Luigi ran across a little boo wearing some of his merchandise that he
thought no one knew about. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hi,&rdquo;
Luigi greeted simply. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo began
to sweat and blush profusely. &ldquo;H-hi I&rsquo;m uh, Booigi the,
uh, Second, and uh-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Watch
out!&rdquo; Luigi pulled Boo aside just as a mini bullet bill shot
past them. Luigi spot the assailant right away, Bowser Junior.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Grr,
I wanted to hit that one,&rdquo; the six year old mumbled, meaning
Toad who was packing up his stand not far away.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That&rsquo;s
just too bad for you. Go home.&rdquo; Yoshi picked up the child and
gave him the boot, literally!</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie&rsquo;s
excitement died down when she met co worker at the parking lot. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sorry, brother. I left ya and I was supposed to be training you. This
might cheer you up.&rdquo; She showed off a super embarrassing photo
snapped of Peach slapping the snot (clearly seen as she good zoom
lenses) out of Bowser. So they took Zoo&rsquo;s bike and was heading
back to the press when they got caught behind a Mushroom Bus at the
stop light. Zoo nearly had a heart attack when the group of koopas
waiting at the stop collectively noticed him. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
waved. &ldquo;Yo, check it out!!! That&rsquo;s Zoo our garbage guy!&rdquo;
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Like a
switch went off Ludwig lunged for Zoo, knocking him straight off the
bike. &ldquo;You are fired!!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hands
off, you royal brat!&rdquo; Kylie pushed Ludwig back onto the
sidewalk. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
is the underling that poisoned my mind! Let me at him!&rdquo; Ludwig
fought, only being held back by Roy and Morton. Zoo got straight up
but he held back, recalling the past. Or &ldquo;past&rdquo;.
Apparently hindsight could help even a lunatic like Zoo..</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">STOP
THAT!&rdquo; Bowser step between Ludwig and Zoo. &ldquo;You made a
horrible plan Ludwig, stop pointing fingers and get over it! You,
garbage dude. You&rsquo;re that person mentioned in the note right?
Where&rsquo;s the sodas then?&rdquo; He turned back to his kids.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy
giggled nervously. &ldquo;The Sumo bros were done with deliveries by
this morning, so uh.. ask that guy?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They&rsquo;re
at the dump,&rdquo; Zoo answered. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
scratched his chin. &ldquo;Then to get this situation done with
forever, the next move should be to-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dispose
to the cans properly, safely, economically!&rdquo; Morton said.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
guffawed. &ldquo;Or wipe it off the planet. Calling an airstrike on
Toad Town&rsquo;s Junkyard, over!&rdquo; he said into a radio.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Roger
that,&rdquo; everyone heard a koopa commando reply on the other end.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Great,
here&rsquo;s our pimpin&rsquo; ride,&rdquo; Larry said as the bus
finally pulled up.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Freeze
koopas!&rdquo; Everyone spun around. Yet again, Mario and co had
caught up.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">This
really is a small level map where we keep runnin&rsquo; into each
other,&rdquo; Bowser grumbled.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
bus stop is one minute away from the stadium so we heard it all. We
are NOT letting you drop a bomb in my kingdom!&rdquo; Peach warned
firmly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
flashed that grin. &ldquo;Try me, hotness!&rdquo; Bowser and his kids
stormed that poor little bus, with Ludwig forcing the driver out with
his zapper. The bus plowed forward, running over Zoo&rsquo;s bike and
dragging it along while he and Kylie watched the entire thing happen
on the sidewalk.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oops,
sorry guys,&rdquo; Mario said, meaning it. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make it
up to you later. Everyone to the dump first!&rdquo; &ldquo;He
galvanized his friends, Peach, Luigi, Daisy, Yoshi, and Toad to head
for that junkyard, leaving the reporter and her apprentice in the
dust.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Finally
Kylie turned to Zoo slowly. &ldquo;Well&hellip; this is pretty
typical for the job. What are you smiling so much about all of a
sudden?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Huh?
Oh uh, nothing. Guess we&rsquo;re walking right?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
glanced around for a cab but got nothing. &ldquo;Looks like it.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip; <font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Do
you know someone called Jelectro Bond?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
paused and stared him in the face. &ldquo;Brother, you got some
secrets don&rsquo;t ya?&rdquo; She smiled afterward. &ldquo;Well
that&rsquo;s fine with me, but that&rsquo;s weird for you to bring
up. I get the feeling you two wouldn&rsquo;t get along. Ya&rsquo;ll
got different styles for sure..&rdquo;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bellstar
Doomella kicked her legs idly while waiting around until the cell
door of her sparkly impenetrable prison finally open. She jumped up
quickly, but saw no one directly in the door way.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Another
fan?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yes,
love. So much that I want your autograph,&rdquo; said Dark Ztar
standing in the doorway. With the door swung open she saw the star
jailers too. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What&rsquo;s
that?&rdquo; Doomella noticed the very long and tattered scroll.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Why,
doesn&rsquo;t it look familiar?&rdquo; He unfold it and she realized
that it had all of her old criminal charges from millenniums ago plus
some newer details tacked on to the bottom in ink that was still wet.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Her face
twisted in mixed emotion. &ldquo;How could you?? I thought you didn&rsquo;t
care?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
quite simple Mrs. Bellstar. I don&rsquo;t, but you borrowed twenty
dollars from me back in the day and with interest that&rsquo;s about,
say-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She ripped
it out of his hands and tore the scroll up, prompting someone in the
back to clear their throat. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Eldstar
himself step up, though cautiously behind the guard. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
wear yourself out dear. As for you Zach-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
Dark Ztar!&rdquo; the dark star remark pointedly.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Okay
fine, but I thought your cooperation was because of that grave thing
Doomella almost did to the Star Spirits?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Doomella
yawned. &ldquo;So I tried to destroy you all and take over the
universe forever ago. What&rsquo;s wrong with a little fun?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">This
is,&rdquo; Eldstar stated, becoming serious. &ldquo;You have a new
banishment location where there are no loop holes regarding alien
psionic powers mortals happen to have and such. I think you&rsquo;ll
like it actually. You will get to be your normal self!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Her eyes
lit up. &ldquo;For real?? Get out of town! Still though, why is that
crusty dude here?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Watch
it, fool,&rdquo; Dark Ztar hissed. &ldquo;I had evidence from you
back at Sarasaland that helped determine your new punishment. Do
enjoy rotting away wherever you are going.&rdquo; He showed off his
broken cellphone. Some might say it&rsquo;s still accidentally
recording to this day.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Eldstar
chuckled at that statement. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you show her the
way, Zach? Take a look at her banishing report right there.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dark Ztar
picked up one of the many pieces of the scroll littering the floor.
His monocle popped off his face. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s banished to the
&lsquo;Dark Realm?!&rsquo; I can&rsquo;t share my bloody abode with
her!&rdquo; he scream over Doomella and eavesdroppers, prisoners and
guards alike, laughing wildly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Back at
the Star Temple, back at his throne where it seemed it all started,
Eldstar made sure he hadn&rsquo;t forgotten anything. The mortals of
Earth met the moral requirement for his computer to do a mild reset,
(It broke and needed the Geek Squad right after, talk about good
timing), the law enforcers were no longer breathing down the necks of
his friends and charges were dropped, and he&rsquo;d rectify his
costly mistake made involving Doomella&rsquo;s banishment location.
As the epitome of fair and good the Great Eldstar thought he&rsquo;d
finally done well.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Or at
least until the next cosmic screw up happened. He&rsquo;d give it a
week max.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">THE END</font></p>
<hr/>

<p align="center"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">WHERE
ARE THEY NOW?! (YES AN EPILOGUE THING)</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
was in his office hanging up his latest decoration, a medium sized
water color painting he&rsquo;d done when someone bang on his door.
Muttering under his breath he sat it down and answered.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
you do want, associate?&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Morris
poked him in the shoulder. &ldquo;Lighten up, fellow. A few of us
like the &lsquo;Shrink&rsquo;, the division five youngers, and Topper
were going to head somewhere nice for breakfast.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
frowned. &ldquo;Nice? It&rsquo;s just at your second job isn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Morris
nodded, holding a wrinkly coupon proudly. &ldquo;Buy one family
special and get a free entree. See?&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
stared at it for a second. He DID need to get out more and it could
take his mind off of other matters. Heck, maybe he should even catch
up on what his family was doing back home. Yes, even his thug step
brother. </font>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thomas the
castle front door guard was goofing off on his Nintendo DS as usual.
He heard the clack of shoes and slipped the goods away just as
Toadette kicked open the doors. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Help!
Quick!&rdquo; She held a bubbling pot.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thomas
toss the pot over the castle&rsquo;s moat. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thanks.
I don&rsquo;t know what went wrong.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He grunt
in reply, itching to return to Fire Emblem.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Uh
huh,&rdquo; she continued, sticking around to his dismay. &ldquo;I
just wanted to use natural ingredients like these white pebble
things. Mr. Toadsworth told me they were sodium crystals but honestly
I- What&rsquo;s that bubbling sound??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">SPLASH!
Shooting up from the moat was a heap of water from the landmine that
exploded. Water quickly swept them into the yard. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
finally stop coughing. &ldquo;Does salt explode now?!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thomas
spat up an entire fish. &ldquo;Better call a bomb expert and I know
one. My uncle&rsquo;s shop isn&rsquo;t far from this Dr. Toadley
guy..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
looked at him funny.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">At
Mushroom Kingdom Hospital East, a tall sledge brother entered wearing
a doctor&rsquo;s coat and a fedora. He march straight up to Nass T.&rsquo;s
desk as it was a slow morning.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hello,
can I help you?&rdquo; the busy head nurse asked. The doctor slid a
note her way under the glass. Nass saw it and blink a few times. &ldquo;Who
are you again?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Courtesy
from the Giant Land Hospital, little lady,&rdquo; the doctor said
very low.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Nass
glanced at the note one last time. It read: &lsquo;You know the end
is near for this facility. Let us pay you to help it along.&rsquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">How
much?&rdquo; She mouthed without actually speaking, being reminded
about MK East&rsquo;s problems in recent times.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With a
half smile, the doctor brought out a shiny pen and scribbled a huge
number on the paper. At the sight of it, Nass&rsquo;s hand lay on her
phone to call Doctor Professor Koopa. Almost. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We&rsquo;ll
handle our problems our way,&rdquo; she said decidedly, going back to
the computer. She wasn&rsquo;t perfect but she also wouldn&rsquo;t go
that low..</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The doctor
crumbled the paper with a start, shoving it deep in his pocket. &ldquo;You
will see that is a mistake!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Security!&rdquo;
she called.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">In an
instant a whomp guard with an eye patch was shoving the &lsquo;visitor&rsquo;
back out the doors.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Reggie
Business bro, founder of Fungus Up was interrupted by a worker
barging into his office. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sir,
you might want to look at this,&rdquo; the magikoopa wearing a sun
visor said. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">When
Reggie came to the front door there were a group of young protesters,
goombas, koopas, buzzy beetles, magikoopas, and more holding signs
with a lone toad security guard in the back.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There
you are, scum!&rdquo; the goomba girl in the front with purple hair
and piercings scream through a megaphone. She was Raven, the leader
of the Dark Land debate club. &ldquo;We have evidence of your unsafe
and speciesist labor practices!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A skittish
toad security guard with black glasses stroll up. &ldquo;Yeah I have
it on tape. I actually work for Morel Moxie. Is it weird that I tape
everything? I&rsquo;m recording right now- Hehehe.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Raven&rsquo;s
boyfriend, the boomerang bro in a trench coat and trilby cleared his
throat. &ldquo;Could you just show the footage you showed us
earlier?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The toad
guard slap his face. &ldquo;Right! Take a gander at this, evil doer!&rdquo;
He dramatically presented footage from right inside the FungusUp
factory via a drone in the window. Captured on film were the
underpaid Dinosaur Land immigrants breaking their backs to work.
Reggie went pale on the spot but his magikoopa worker shoved the
tablet away. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No
way! That footage is fake!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Then
let&rsquo;s check,&rdquo; Raven said. She along with the rest of the
protesters storm the FungusUp building and Reggie was hopeless to
stop any of it. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His
employee shivered. &ldquo;What should we do?!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
have an idea...&rdquo; Reggie regain his composure with a mischievous
glint in his eye.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Somewhere
just outside of Toad Town was an old trailer in a lot with a beat up
work truck parked beside it, both spray painted colorfully. Inside
Richard lay down his hand. Goombas didn&rsquo;t have hands so it was
a good thing that was a figure of speech. He had all aces with his
deck of cards. &ldquo;Go fish, wimps.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sebastian,
a snifit seated across the table dropped his to the floor. &ldquo;I
can NEVER win.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Parabilly
shushed the snifit, clacking away on his laptop. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
wait&rsquo;n for an email from my folks. There&rsquo;s this
restaurant down town and he can score us a deal.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The old
parakoopa was interrupted by the door trailer door swinging open.
Their leader James pushed Wiggletron inside still holding paint cans.
The monty mole on the other hand was covered in sweat.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boys,&rdquo;
James started, digging in a closet for his hazmat suit. &ldquo;We
gots an urgent one! Remember that fake story in the news &lsquo;bout
the Giant Land Hospital trying to bribe others out of business? An
anonymous tip from just this morning says it&rsquo;s true after all!
We gotta bust em!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">This news
shocked everyone into silence until Sebastian hesitantly faced the
mega goomba&rsquo;s way. &ldquo;Umm&hellip; Aren&rsquo;t you from
Giant Land?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yep,&rdquo;
Richard replied with a straight face. Believe it or not, he was fully
convinced that ALL people from Giant Land were jerks. Yes, that
included himself.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Somewhere
in the galaxy, Rosalina was back at the Space Observatory&rsquo;s
library.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Also,
this!&rdquo; screamed a random luma grunt. They and a few others
dropped some cannonballs from Bowser on the floor for no reason,
resulting in many bouncing and rolling. Rosalina ordered them to get
rid of those relics of the past lest they start a time paradox, so
why they were bringing them to her she haven&rsquo;t a clue,
especially when she was busy emailing her date who was running a
little late!</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Take
them away,&rdquo; Rosalina repeated over her shoulder. She heard a
noise. &ldquo;He is here! Everyone prepare!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Standing
outside the library door was the most handsome man, tall, dark
skinned, and wearing a traditional garb of royalty. Rosalina nearly
fainted on sight, but held it all together enough to walk off with
him in the distance chatting away.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Polari had
his jaw to the ground. Who? How? The Nigerian prince was real.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Probabilly
nailed the last board across the windows. The storm that wasn&rsquo;t
supposed to be until Saturday decided to sweep Southern Mushroom
Kingdom early, locking most of the shanty town inside and leaving it
up to him to secure the hospital&rsquo;s leaky windows. At least that
mess was done with. Back inside the lobby was toasty and warm, but
Jr. Troopa was at his favorite table, the one under his very own
fishing trophy on the wall. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
is all of this??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jr. Troopa
leaned up from the calculus books. &ldquo;I asked my buddy for help
but I ain&rsquo;t gonna get it in this weather. I asked Vick but he&rsquo;s
dumb as bricks and Laki doesn&rsquo;t work till tomorrow. Rou T. gave
it a look and got a headache. I&rsquo;m desperate!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Shaking
his head, the elder paratroopa pulled a chair up. &ldquo;Know how I
can fix anything? It&rsquo;s all math, hear?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jr. Troopa
nodded. &ldquo;Can you show me?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Probabilly
hovered the pencil over the worksheets for a minute before finally
taking off his wet hood. &ldquo;Get me a sec. I can never decide what
formula I wanna use..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
night, the Southern Mushroom Kingdom would get record rain fall for
early spring- twelve inches in fact. Everyone was okay though,
because hardly anyone was ever sick down South. It must be something
in the water, but in a good way, hear?</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Late back
at the Mushroom Press, the staff were out aside from Mitch, who was
showing Zoo something on his computer screen.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So
all of those people are like us?&rdquo; Zoo asked. On the forums were
numerous confused people earnestly believing that today Friday had
repeated.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mitch
nodded. &ldquo;This sort of thing is kind of a research project for
me. Keep it on the hush, okay? So...&rdquo; Mitch shut off the
computer and began to pack up. &ldquo;What are you gonna do with
yourself now?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
thought for a moment. What would he do now as a &lsquo;reporter&rsquo;
who had lots to learn but also evenings off? &ldquo;I got it.&rdquo;
Zoo snapped as he head out.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-You&rsquo;re
gonna perform at Club Gamecube.&rdquo; Mitch laughed, reading Zoo
like a book. &ldquo;Do you think your handsome noki friend would like
that place?&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo froze
in the doorway flushing. &ldquo;Shut up! I was going to try to call
him tomorrow with the office phone and it won&rsquo;t be a prank call
so don&rsquo;t screw with me, bro!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
ever dude...&rdquo; After a pause, Mitch found himself staring at
Kylie&rsquo;s office space. Maybe he had someone to check up on
himself...</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Friday
April 3, 2016 had come and gone. Mario and a few others arrived at
Peach&rsquo;s castle to find the ground damp even though it didn&rsquo;t
rain in East Toad Town. Mario&rsquo;s ears were still ringing from
that Bowser Bomb that went off, but it could have been worse. At
least they could say no one can possibly get involved in whatever the
tainted soda thing was. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
did we miss?&rdquo; Mario asked Dr. Toadley who was near the door.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Will
I tell you another day? Yes I will,&rdquo; he replied, his expression
hidden in the darkness. &ldquo;Just be glad this day did not turn out
the way it could have..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Before
Mario could interpret that, Luigi snuck up on him. &ldquo;Check this
out. Fresh from the factory today!&rdquo; Luigi held a white can in
his hand labeled &lsquo;New FungusUp&rsquo; and took a sip. &ldquo;The
marking blurb is that it tastes the exact same minus any illegal
ingredients, but I&rsquo;m not so sure.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Me
neither,&rdquo; Daisy added, putting an arm around Luigi&rsquo;s
shoulder. &ldquo;I think robots make it now. Yep. That has to be it.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
tasted it and- Yuck, he wasn&rsquo;t a fan. He didn&rsquo;t protest
when Bowser snatched it for his own taste but he did when Bowser spit
it back out at him.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
shrugged. &ldquo;Well, it sucks!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Why
are you here?&rdquo; Peach asked.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
that, hotness? I just wanted to make sure I&rsquo;d caught all the
Dark Land protesters hanging around.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Why
was that a thing? It was on the evening news I think,&rdquo; Luigi
said.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
crossed his arms. &ldquo;I hate those brats. Always complaining first
being tired of being World 8, then if it&rsquo;s possible to love a
paper towel, then the pharmacies being overpriced. Heh. If anything
my work force is too medicated. I can&rsquo;t stand that stank fire
flower plant the kids use. What now? Get to the point?? Oh yeah, the
new topic was working conditions and they might stop here soon with
the way you pay these toads &lsquo;round here,&rdquo; Bowser added
with a chuckle.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
looked suddenly disturbed. &ldquo;Every toad is getting a raise!&rdquo;
she announced loudly out of the blue. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
leaned in. &ldquo;And for you, plumber breath.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
received a slip of paper while no one was looking with Bowser&rsquo;s
new phone number. &ldquo;What a day,&rdquo; he said, eager for
Bowser&rsquo;s next phone call that would lead to the next adventure.
Maybe too eager.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Having
a frenemy was complicated, but very worth it.</font></p>
