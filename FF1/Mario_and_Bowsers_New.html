<p>Summary</p>

one for updated news!!!!</blockquote>
<div id="chapters" dir="ltr"><h2><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">1.
	Go-Karting with Bowser 2nd Edition</font></h2>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoom! One
	racer used a mushroom to fly off a ramp, clear the one-thousand foot
	drop below, and land in third place. The racer in eighth was
	unfortunate enough to overshoot a tight curve. They flew off the
	track and Lakitu &lsquo;fished&rsquo; them to safety. The first
	place racer used their Koopa Troopa shells to block the perfectly
	aimed red shell barrage from the disgruntled second place racer.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">This was
	a Mario Kart race (-SPONSORED BY FUNGUS UP:: The drink that &lsquo;springs
	up overnight!&rsquo;), where Mario Mario, famed hero, and his
	diverse acquaintances routinely took it to the streets, dirt tracks,
	underwater, sand, snow, whatever Cheese Land is supposed to be, and
	anything else to win the gold. This particular race took place on
	the floating, ever dangerous Rainbow Road so calming music played,
	comets darted through the dark sky, and the nerves of ever racer
	were on edge. The usual. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario,
	you&rsquo;re an idiot..&rdquo; King Bowser Koopa growled as he
	trailed a few yards behind Mario in his kart. His massive clawed
	hands gripped the steering wheel tighter.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Cool wind
	blew through Mario&rsquo;s hair and mustache as he ignored his
	greatest rival, more concerned with holding the lead in the final
	lap. An item box gifted him a single banana, immediately deployed
	behind his kart as he saw Bowser approaching in his rear view. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Caught
	up with ya, plumber boy!&rdquo; Bowser said. The two where parallel,
	taking turns glaring at each other before bringing their attention
	back to the daring curves of Rainbow Road. &ldquo;Just wait until I
	get a Super Leaf!&rdquo; Bowser veered into Mario&rsquo;s path,
	bumping the plumber almost off the edge. Mario did the same only to
	nudge Bowser about an inch.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Gained
	some pounds?&rdquo; Mario teased. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Back
	at you, Red.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well,&rdquo;
	Mario continued, &ldquo;you know that item&rsquo;s only in Mario
	Kart 7, right?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Huh?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Which
	one is this?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Eight.
	I think?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...I
	knew that!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad, the
	relatively young and new adviser to the Princess shrieked as a
	sudden burst of speed put him right behind hero and villain. Mario
	caught the entire thing in his rear view. Toad was completely
	engulfed by the shadow of a looming Thundercloud. Zap! In a blinding
	flash, Toad was shrunk, allowing Yoshi to take his place in third.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi!
	Yoshi!&rdquo; Yoshi said, speaking in his native tongue. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Good
	riddance. These losers were starting to get too much narration,&rdquo;
	Bowser said. &ldquo;This is about OUR rivalry. Now watch this. I&rsquo;ve
	done all of the calculations and this will hit you smack in that
	stupid plumber face!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	threw a green shell at a barrier with &lsquo;FUNGUS UP&rsquo; on it.
	The shell ricocheted backwards and shot right past Bowser, narrowly
	missing. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	stifled a laugh. &ldquo;Bowser? Er, what grades did you get in math
	again?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser&rsquo;s
	vision went red until he took a deep breath. His new doctor had been
	getting on him about his blood pressure after all.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Meanwhile
	far up in the heavens, even farther than Rainbow Road, the Great
	Eldstar&rsquo;s pager went off. This typically indicated that some
	lightning was needed somewhere on Earth. In fiddling with the pager,
	Eldstar dropped the star shard he was polishing and the priceless
	artifact made a loud clink on the marble floors of the Star Temple.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Is
	everything fine?&rdquo; Twink&rsquo;s childlike voice echoed from
	across the hall.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">All
	is Fine,&rdquo; Klevar spoke up from a pile of ancient books. &ldquo;There
	is probably a Mario Kart occurring. Did you know that the
	thundercloud item has 7,000,000 bolts of electricity? I read it
	right here...&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The Great
	Eldstar finally read the message from the pager to see that Klevar
	was correct. Eldstar&rsquo;s powers weren&rsquo;t really for
	amusement and fake gold trophies, but he did it anyway. The
	pushover...</font></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...Back
	on earth:</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	was so upset he was lost for words when he spun out on a measly
	banana. In a matter of a few minutes the competition got fierce with
	the twelve racers, Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, Peach, Daisy, Toad, Bowser,
	Donkey Kong, Koopa, Toadette, Junior, and Birdo being in one massive
	group. Mario collided with a fake item box and surrendered first
	place. He felt the prize slipped out of his hands until-</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">ZAP!
	Everyone except for Donkey Kong in 12th place were reduced to wimpy
	toy sized karts. It happened so suddenly that there was mass
	confusion. Koopa, Toadette, and Birdo fell off the edge. Junior,
	Daisy and Peach collided with loose items already on the track.
	Yoshi, that crazy dinosaur, didn&rsquo;t care and drove merrily as
	ever in fun-size. Toad&rsquo;s brain was already kind of fried from
	the previous thunder strike so he was fine. Maybe.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Donkey
	Kong silently thanked the Crystal Coconut for whatever had just
	happened. He barged through everyone and was about to get first.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Not
	so fast, monkey breath!&rdquo; Bowser threw a banana ahead of
	himself which bounced off of a &lsquo;LICHEN COLA&rsquo; barrier and
	straight into Donkey Kong&rsquo;s face. The blinded ape veered to
	the side and rammed into the a barrier, spinning out.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	pushed the pedal to the metal at the opening for first. Bowser saw
	this and slammed the gas as well. The finish line was only a few
	meters away and the two gunned it past all remaining racers. Both
	hero and villain crossed the line in miniature form. </font>
	</p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">All
	twelve racers eagerly gathered around in the Mario Kart Lobby, a
	garage like area, to see their final score. The top three placements
	were permitted access to the &lsquo;VIP&rsquo; lounge, often called
	the &lsquo;winner&rsquo;s circle&rsquo;. The normal lobby, &lsquo;loser&rsquo;s
	circle&rsquo;, was for everyone else. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dfkd
	s flksdj f lksdfe wr!&rdquo; Toad said to everyone who was getting
	restless.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Everyone
	stared back at the castle adviser until Lakitu behind a laptop
	cleared his throat loudly.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Okay,
	I finally got this blasted thing to work. Third place.. Yoshi.
	Yay...&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi!&rdquo;
	Yoshi did a &lsquo;flutter jump&rsquo; as he accepted his bronze
	trophy. He strolled right through the glass doors to the VIP area
	which housed drink machines full of popular sodas, a large couch,
	and a big TV showing replays.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lakitu
	continued unceremoniously. &ldquo;Second&hellip; Toad.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad spun
	in circles, bowed, and then said, &ldquo;Asdkfjsdl lksdrlfk slkfsdl
	sldkfjsdl kdk!&rdquo; He took his silver trophy and did back flips
	to the winner&rsquo;s circle. No one questioned anything..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lakitu
	squinted oddly at the final result on screen. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">WHO
	WON ALREADY?!?&rdquo; several racers shouted.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lakitu
	rolled his eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen this before but I
	don&rsquo;t really care. First place in the cup with the highest
	score is&hellip;.Mario-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	jumped in the air in triumph.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-and
	Bowser with a score of fifty points. The rest of you? You lose, go
	home!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	landed on the ground wide eyed as everyone else dispersed, skipping
	the losers circle to visit their own comfy houses where they
	wouldn&rsquo;t be so harshly judged for their placement in a sport
	that Mario only came up with based on his brief experiences as a
	taxi driver. Lakitu shoved the fake gold trophy in Mario hand and
	then left, muttering something about needed vacation time.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah!
	Got ya Red!...&rdquo; Bowser waved a claw in front of Mario&rsquo;s
	face. &ldquo;...Moron, hello? I know I&rsquo;m awesome but you can
	stop drooling..&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	snapped out of it. &ldquo;How could we tie? Eh, never mind. You&rsquo;re
	going to call me for &lsquo;round two&rsquo;, right?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well
	OF COURSE. You&rsquo;d better be in top shape tomorrow.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	raised one eyebrow. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	flashed his sharp teeth in an expression that could vaguely be
	described as a smile.&ldquo;Oh you forgot? The tennis match&rsquo;s
	tomorrow and I changed the line up posted. You&rsquo;re now my
	partner!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	looked at him like he was crazy. &ldquo;You did?! So what happened
	to Luigi&rsquo;s name then?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He&rsquo;ll
	survive on the bleachers. As pesky and infuriating as you are,
	you&rsquo;re still one of the best players.&rdquo; Bowser chuckled.
	&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not gonna shackle myself to any of these other
	losers &lsquo;round here!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wow,&rdquo;
	Mario mouthed silently with his head titled up as he questioned the
	stars as to how much more messed up the day could be, only he heard
	the low drone of something above. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Uh,
	that sounds like my ride getting close.&rdquo; Bowser looked around.
	&ldquo;I'm getting a drink, want something?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I&rsquo;m
	on a diet.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sure.&rdquo;
	Bowser stared at Mario&rsquo;s gut briefly. &ldquo;Since one of us
	here are comfortable with our bodies, spare me a few coins. A want a
	Morel Moxie and I left my wallet in my other shell.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario dug
	in his pocket to see what he had. &ldquo;If I give you the dumb
	coins, will you leave me alone?&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	flashed him that &lsquo;grin&rsquo; again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the one
	stuck here waiting here for my ride. You could have left anytime,
	but I know, I&rsquo;m irresistible. Ha! Why don&rsquo;t you tell the
	princess that too sometime?&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	slapped the coins in Bowser&rsquo;s hand then slapped his own face. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The rest
	of the day moved on like the constantly shifting scenes of a stage
	play. That night, Mario lie in bed mildly bothered as he was
	reminded yet again that all excitement in his life was often tied to
	Bowser. What did that mean, he wondered as he dimmed the lights,
	Luigi long asleep in his own bunk across the bedroom. Mario was in
	contact with Bowser as much as, well, all of his other friends.
	Their intense and competitive interactions were becoming a sport in
	itself. Bowser was certainly an enemy, no one who cost so much
	trouble could be anything but, but he was almost a friend. A friend
	you dislike. Mario could get used to that. Maybe forever even...</font></p>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It was a
	normal early morning at the Mario residence. Luigi&rsquo;s heavy
	eyes blinked a few times as he leaned up and bed and stretched,
	Mario snoring loudly in the background. Luigi glanced towards his
	older brother and then the clock. 6 AM. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	threw his pillow at Mario. &ldquo;Bro!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	tossed and turned but the earth rumbling snoring continued. Just
	before Luigi could head over to try something else, Mario&rsquo;s
	cellphone vibrated on the nightstand. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi saw
	the caller id. &ldquo;Bowser?!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wha-
	Bowser?&rdquo; Mario repeated.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Pale
	faced, Luigi jumped on Mario&rsquo;s bed and shook him violently.
	&ldquo;Bro wakeup wakeup it&rsquo;s Bowser calling!!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ahhhhhh!&rdquo;
	Mario screamed in return.</font></p>
	<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
	have one new voicemail.&rsquo;*Beep*</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
	froze as the voicemail began to play.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey,
	pipes for brains, wake up call! Bwa ha ha!&rdquo; The Mario brothers
	could hear a loud &lsquo;Koopa Symphony&rsquo; in the background of
	Bowser&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Ah hem. But anyway, if we lose our
	match today, you&rsquo;re toast! Oh and tell the Princess I&rsquo;ll
	be looking my best today. Just for her!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	couldn&rsquo;t roll his eyes harder that comment. Luigi didn&rsquo;t
	notice over the nervous clacking of his own teeth.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lastly.
	Umm, well. What&rsquo;s the recipe for that Couples Cake again? You
	know, the one only friends eat together? *Mumbling noises were
	heard*- Kamek, no this isn&rsquo;t Mario- *mumbling noises* Umm,
	gotta go. Keep that cellphone smokin&rsquo;! Wait, that don&rsquo;t
	make sense. Whatever. See ya, plumber breath.&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">*Beep*
	&lsquo;End of message. You have no new messages. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario was
	lamenting how how messed up this day could go until he noticed his
	brother. &ldquo;...Weegee what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi was
	on his bed lying back. &ldquo;Oh nothing,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;I
	probably wouldn&rsquo;t have been a good partner for you anyway...&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	leap out of bed, white t-shirt, red boxers and all. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
	know he did it until yesterday. I&rsquo;m sorry...&rdquo; Somehow he
	didn&rsquo;t feel like that was quite enough, but there was no more
	to really say.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No
	I really didn&rsquo;t want to play tennis.&rdquo; Luigi got up.
	&ldquo;...Yeah. My tennis elbow has been acting up anyway.&rdquo; He
	left the bedroom.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	thought of antics from last week. There was a plumbing mishap
	because the princess finally gave in to constant requests to have a
	soda machine installed in the castle, only it went south when the
	water lines weren&rsquo;t up to snuff. The disaster nearly drowned
	them both and was ultimately patched up with duct tape and prayers
	that a leak wouldn&rsquo;t spring up again, plus Luigi strain an arm
	holding a door full of water back so that five orphans visiting the
	castle could escape safely. (Those events were somehow related.) </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	followed him out. &ldquo;Little bro, I promise the won&rsquo;t
	happen again.. Bros before koopas, right?&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	turned around from the open fridge. &ldquo;Fine. One question
	though. What did that Couples Cake taste like?&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	ate the whole thing on his own! So much for a dish that you can&rsquo;t
	eat alone.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	laughed dryly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you get for being friendly
	with a koopa! Try a Trial Stew next time!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	collapsed at the kitchen table&rsquo;s chair already sleepy again.
	Mario however had the special ability wake up at 100%, so he rumbled
	through the cabinets for cooking pans. Cooking was always his thing,
	and with the eventual smell of pancakes in the air, Luigi found it
	hard to stay too upset at the red plumber.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You&rsquo;re
	just spectating??&rdquo; Toad asked with some worry. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	twitchy subordinate of the Princess ran a concession stand in front
	of the tennis stadium. At 8 AM in the morning, this was a bright
	sunny day in Toad Town with crowds already starting to gather for
	the tournament. Toad wasn&rsquo;t the only booth around selling
	useless junk, but he knew his booth stood out. The tip jar half full
	of shiny coins testified to that fact.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
	heard me right. Do you have a chill? You&rsquo;ve been jittery since
	yesterday.&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;m
	perfectly fine. Want to try a shroom shake?&rdquo; Toad picked up a
	pitcher full of something blue.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
	flavor is that?&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">My
	favorite, homeboy. Purple flavor.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">But
	that&rsquo;s blue.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad put
	a hand on his hip. &ldquo;Listen, I&rsquo;m letting you try one on
	the house so take it you pathetic butt munch player two option!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Okay
	okay! I&rsquo;ll try it!&rdquo; With a sales pitch like that, how
	could he refuse?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	took a sip, tasting a flavor explosion of banana, melon, and peach.
	It almost toppled the addictively acidic taste of a Lichen Cola.
	Almost. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Did
	you like it?&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi did
	a thumbs up when Mario came walking by waving.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	waved back as Yoshi joined them, just getting off of the phone.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What&rsquo;s
	up my homeboy!&rdquo; Toad replied through a megaphone.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	covered his ears. &ldquo;Oww!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
	are you selling?!&rdquo; Yoshi asked.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Homemade
	shroom shakes. End the domination of the soda companies.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Birdo
	and I was just talking about their business practices, especially
	FungusUp. We found out how little they pay the Dinosaur Land
	immigrants in their factories. Anyway, I&rsquo;ll pass for now
	because honestly I don&rsquo;t trust anything you make, but you&rsquo;re
	fighting a good fight.&rdquo; Yoshi dropped a few coins in the tip
	jar anyway. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thanks,
	you stupid horse!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey!&rdquo;
	Yoshi kicked boxed Toad backwards, sending him flying into the
	bushes behind his stand.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sorry,
	my foot slipped,&rdquo; Yoshi said with a chuckle. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
	see you two in the stadium, bye.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ha
	ha! Good one, homeboy!&rdquo; Toad said from somewhere under the
	foliage.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">All of a
	sudden, Luigi felt the need to get the heck out of there, dealing
	with two crazies. He made way for the entrance where there were
	various Mushroom Kingdom citizens moping around before the game
	started. Luigi got in the long line to enter the stadium. Luigi
	tapped his foot while he checked his watch, a gift from his
	grandfather Pablo Pizzacaso. It was old and the crystal was cracked,
	but it never lost a minute. He peered way ahead to see that the line
	was actually for a popcorn station! With his palm hitting his face,
	Luigi almost walked off before noticing the person a head of him for
	the first time.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey,
	Boo. I haven&rsquo;t seen you since Mario Party&hellip; whatever
	number we&rsquo;re on. Do you still play tennis with that mean
	curve?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo
	turned around and blushed under his gaze.&ldquo;Sometimes, hehe. Do
	you know someone&rsquo;s been defacing your posters?&rdquo; They
	pulled out a poster that had &lsquo;Mario and Luigi vs Toad and
	Daisy&rsquo; on it, only someone had marked through Luigi&rsquo;s
	face with a red X mark.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	sighed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true. I&rsquo;m out of the game.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
	no!!&rdquo; Boo ripped off the white shirt they suddenly wore to
	reveal a green shirt underneath with Luigi&rsquo;s face on it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
	your biggest fan, Booigi the Second! Who&rsquo;s partnering with
	your brother then??&rdquo; Boo asked urgently, like the wrong answer
	might rock their world.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So Luigi
	gave the mathematician&rsquo;s answer. &ldquo;Mario will be working
	with his greatest and most feared friend and enemy, Bowser!&rdquo;</font></p>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	Von Koopa, fresh out of bed with his loose fitting robe and all,
	stood with his ear to the door as &lsquo;Reprisal in A minor&rsquo;
	played from the auditorium within. He&rsquo;d forgotten the mental
	state he was in when he wrote the ten minute classical piece a month
	ago, one of business and near burn out, so that such a turbulent six
	stanza piece was an outlet. He felt so great after composing it, but
	now that feeling of hanging on by a thread was back. He-</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey,
	Luddy-sama. I was thinking of something that could end world
	hunger-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	whipped around with fiery eyes. &ldquo;Do you not see me meditating
	on peaceful music?!?&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy made
	a face. &ldquo;Gosh, okay. I&rsquo;ll scrap that idea forever
	then...pfft.&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Visiting
	the depths of his inner psyche, something was clouded and permeated
	by intense anger of an unknown source-</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Prince
	Ludwig, in the kitchen there&rsquo;s-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kamek,&rdquo;
	Ludwig said dangerously. &ldquo;I am thinking right now. Do not
	disturb me.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kamek
	shrugged. &ldquo;Fine. I&rsquo;ll give your portion of Koopasta to
	the dog again...&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">But where
	these feelings his? They had to have been. What was already
	accomplished would lead to what was always the end goal, so why did
	this plan feel so alien? The music stopped and Lemmy slammed open
	the door, smacking Ludwig in the face.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sorry,
	Luddy. I didn&rsquo;t see you there.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	held his face. &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; he groaned.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
	continued to juggle five bowling pins. &ldquo;The radio switched to
	a song I didn&rsquo;t like. It&rsquo;s all yours.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	rushed in where the auditorium was empty save for the portable radio
	setting on the stage where Lemmy was just doing his early morning
	practicing. Ludwig pulled himself together and remembered what he
	needed to do for the plan, tune in to WMUSH. If his calculations
	were correct, the rest of the day would come together as well.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	threw another dart at Mario. The metal tipped barb dug in an inch
	deep, straight in Mario's nose. Crudely taped to a wall in the men&rsquo;s
	locker room was a tattered 36x24 poster of Mario doing a 'v' sign,
	speckled with innumerable tiny holes.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Aww,
	you own posters of me!&rdquo; Mario said sweetly. He noticed that
	Bowser&rsquo;s red hair was gelled back and he had a kind of sweet
	smell.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yes,
	AND?!&rdquo; Bowser retorted. &ldquo;These are for &lsquo;motivation&rsquo;
	to wipe the floor with you in real life. Oh, and nice for you to
	finally show up, fuzz face. The game is only ten minutes from now.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	opened his mouth to give a sharp reply but then closed it. Bowser
	was correct. After saying his goodbyes to his friends outside the
	courtyard, Mario wandered on way of the locker rooms. First a young
	reporter from the Mushroom Press flagged him down for an interview
	and he was too nice to shoo them away. Then he ran across someone
	selling hot dogs inside of the stadium. His stomach refused to let
	him walk past empty handed. Lastly, Princess Peach was setting
	around in the chair umpire area and he had a friendly talk with her.
	As Mario was never one to wear a watch, he&rsquo;d lost track of
	time and became &lsquo;fashionably late&rsquo;. -If one considers a
	plumber getup fashionable that is; Bowser would certainly disagree..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	began to pace. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s our game plan?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Stay
	out of my way so I don&rsquo;t destroy you and let me hit the ball
	all of the time.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Good
	plan. One problem. That&rsquo;s not how tennis works at all.&rdquo;
	Mario frowned.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	crossed his arms. &ldquo;Well, at least I&rsquo;m ready to play.
	Where&rsquo;s your racket?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	rolled his eyes as he dug into his duffle bag. Out from it came his
	signature 'M' tennis racket in well used condition. His fireball
	power shots had taken a toll with black burn marks turning the whole
	thing several shades darker than the blue color it originally was.
	Mario immediately heard laughter from the koopa king.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You&rsquo;re
	playing with THAT, Man in Red?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	swung in the air a few times, testing his grip. &ldquo;Why not?
	Also, going a bit soft with the insults are we?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Plumber,
	the only thing soft is that crappy tennis racket. Do you really want
	to fail me?!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
	make it sound like we&rsquo;ve been assigned a high-school project
	together.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Shut
	up. Point is, it&rsquo;s toast. Literally!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	noticed some black crumbly bits stuck to his glove but he wasn&rsquo;t
	about to admit that Bowser was right again. Hiding it behind his
	back, he said, &ldquo;Either way, I can carry myself in the game.
	I&rsquo;d be more worried about your speed problems.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Before
	Bowser could respond, the doors of the locker room swung wide open,
	letting the blinding light of outdoors bleed in.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Just
	checking in on my homeboys! LET'S HAVE A GREAT GAME!&quot; Toad
	screamed into that megaphone again. He was standing in the door.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
	it&rsquo;s just Fungusface,&rdquo; Bowser said under his breath,
	&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t we have this talk before with extra characters?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey,
	I have that poster,&rdquo; Toad said. &ldquo;I see I&rsquo;m not the
	only enemy and fan!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Back
	off mushroom!&rdquo; Bowser said dangerously. Mario nodded in
	acquiescence, but he did wonder what Toad meant by enemy and fan.
	Since when was Toad an enemy?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Flash
	back-</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Small
	Mario and Tanooki Toad were at the end of a stage in Mario 3D World.
	The timer was about to run down in five seconds.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
	no, we&rsquo;re not going to make it! Jump!&rdquo; Mario said to
	Toad. They climbed the staircase to the top of the flag pole.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Okay,
	homeboy!&rdquo; Toad proceed to jump on top of Mario&rsquo;s head
	and get a boost to the top where he earned a 1-Up. Mario on the
	other hand, got launched smack into the ground where the timer hit
	zero and he died.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh, yeah
	then...</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Gotya
	buddies! Toad OUT!&rdquo; Toad said in the megaphone again, snapping
	Mario out of it. Bowser&rsquo;s hands shot up to cover his ears at
	the offending noise, bumping Mario and making him drop the racket
	that was still behind his back.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">CRACK!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	brittle and battle worn racket lay on the floor, broken in half. The
	racket that had lasted every Mario Tennis game until now was gone.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;OH
	NO!&quot; Mario dropped to the floor to pick up the pieces. Each
	piece he grabbed shattered into another.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	got something from his own duffle bag. &ldquo;Stop crying, idiot.
	You can&rsquo;t be my partner without a racket so I&rsquo;m gonna be
	nice just this one time. Here!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He gave
	Mario a heavy green tennis racket, which otherwise resembled
	Bowser&rsquo;s purple one, down to the menacing Bowser emblem on it.
	</font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Umm.
	Thanks..I think?&rdquo; Mario swung this one in the air, only to
	find the entire balance of it different. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hmm.
	Yeah, try not to fall on your face, hear? It&rsquo;s game time.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	gasped as he saw the clock. It was now or never, partnered with
	Bowser or not.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
	entered the locker room to find Daisy sitting on the benches and
	playing an action packed game on her phone. The Sarasaland princess
	had on an orange tank-top and shorts and her hair was tied back with
	a hair band.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What&rsquo;s
	up Daisy?&rdquo; Toad greeted as he entered.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daisy
	continued to stab at the touchscreen. &ldquo;Just remember the plan
	we discussed over the phone.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Are
	you alright?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daisy
	shot up from her seat. &ldquo;You think?!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Umm&hellip;
	no or I wouldn&rsquo;t be asking you?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She put
	the phone down and walked around in circles. &ldquo;Forget it. I&rsquo;d
	better live it up while this game lasts. I mean, there&rsquo;s no
	telling when I&rsquo;ll get to hang around ya&rsquo;ll again.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Then it
	hit Toad what she meant. &ldquo;Homegirl, don&rsquo;t be like that.
	Our roles change up all the time and not all of us are A-list, but
	that doesn&rsquo;t mean any of us are forgotten.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daisy
	stopped. &ldquo;You mean that?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Of
	course. Listen, I&rsquo;m a guy named after my species. Most people
	don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m one person, or two people, or clones
	of each other or what. By the way, the answer is all of the above.
	But still, people know who I am. There&rsquo;s tons of Daisy fans
	out there considering there&rsquo;s just one of you.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daisy
	smiled with her eyes to the ground. &ldquo;Thanks for that, Toad. &hellip;
	I can see why they made you the new Castle Adviser.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
	blushed. &ldquo;Just doing what a Toad&rsquo;s gotta do-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There was
	a soft knock on the door.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I'll
	get it,&quot; Toad said. He opened the door to find a delivery guy. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Gift
	from a fan,&rdquo; the dark boo with a ball cap covering his face
	said in a low snarky tone.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
	received a brown paper bag and the door was closed before Daisy
	caught up. Inside were two personalized Fungus Up 12oz cans with
	&lsquo;Toad&rsquo; and &lsquo;Daisy&rsquo; inscribed on them,
	usually only available in lavish locations like Poshley Heights.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wow,
	I&rsquo;ll take that, thank you!&rdquo; Daisy popped open hers and
	gulped it down, feeling that the castle adviser&rsquo;s words were
	prophetic somehow.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
	popped open his. &ldquo;I feel kind of hypocritical considering what
	I was just selling outside of the stadium but&hellip; Oh well!&rdquo;
	He gulped it down, begrudgingly noting that the lemon lime taste of
	Fungus Up was decent even with the can tasting slightly flat. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;YEEEAAAHHH
	DAISY!&quot; She did a triple back flip which resulted in her hair
	band falling off. She then shook her hair loose and let it lay on
	her shoulders.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Nice!!
	Need this?&rdquo; Toad picked up the hair band.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Keep
	it. It&rsquo;s game time!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;ll
	wear it then to symbolize that we&rsquo;re in sync and stuff now.&rdquo;
	Toad put the flower emblem accessory on like a sweat band. </font>
	</p>
	<hr/>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A modest
	sized crowd gathered in the all purpose outdoor stadium, intended to
	host small sports events in Toad Town. The crowd took to like, split
	down the sides. The right had lots of toads, bob-omb buddies, nokis,
	piantas, and other friendly species. On the left however were koopa
	troop soldiers, bandits, mean looking thwomps, and other enemies who
	had caught on that Bowser would be playing.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Members
	of the audience could hardly contain their excitement as Mario and
	Bowser left the locker rooms and entered the field. Bowser waved at
	Peach who as in the empire chair, but she sort of winkled her nose
	at him and turned away. Bowser growled, especially when the right
	side of the crowd began to laugh.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Ladies
	and gentlemen...and Bowser!&quot; Lakitu and Bowser exchanged nasty
	looks. &ldquo;In this doubles match we have Mario and Bowser-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	crowds on both sides cheered wildly.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-vs

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Crickets
	chirped.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That&rsquo;s
	not nice,&rdquo; Mario whispered to Bowser.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Serves
	em right. Dumb secondary characters...&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad and
	Daisy entered the tennis court and got into position. Toad and
	Bowser were hugging the net and Daisy and Mario farther back. Daisy
	looked normal if slightly disheveled, while Toad was wearing a
	flowery band on his head. Both he and she twitched, not unheard of
	from Toad considering how often he got electrocuted, but very odd
	for the princess. Even odder, Mario thought, was the slight foaming
	at the mouth. </font>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thwak!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A tennis

	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario?!
	I was joking about using your head as a racket. Wake up!!&rdquo;
	Bowser growled.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">For

	have sworn it was never said a first time.</font></p>

	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey,
	that&rsquo;s not right!&rdquo; Luigi shout in protest. No one heard
	him because he was about a mile away from the field however.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	know right?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	turned to see the Boo from before beside him. &ldquo;Hey, I didn&rsquo;t
	even notice you there. Why are you up here?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Because
	I&rsquo;m&hellip; a loser?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	smiled. &ldquo;Me too!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The crowd
	around them cut the conversation short with roaring laughter. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	turned back to the game. &ldquo;What happened??&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo
	covered their eyes. &ldquo;Oh no! I think the umpire hit Mario with
	a ball, hehe! Uh, you know I&rsquo;m not actually laughing about
	that right?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	swung towards Toad who had no issue returning the ball. Bowser
	intercepted at the net and smacked the ball hard in Daisy&rsquo;s
	direction. It was almost past Daisy when she did a backflip into the
	ball&rsquo;s path and hit it backhand. The ball flew straight
	between the gap of Mario and Bowser.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Love-15.&rdquo;
	Lakitu announced.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario was
	left scratching his head at that one.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Don&rsquo;t
	know either, plumber boy. Let&rsquo;s just win.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	served again towards Toad who curved the ball around Bowser at the
	net. Mario sliced the ball in front of Daisy. She delivered a nasty
	topspin straight down the line. Bowser did a mad dash towards center
	and returned it, so hard it went out of bounds.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Out.
	Love-30!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario pat
	Bowser on his spiky back. &ldquo;Way to go,&rdquo; he said
	sarcastically. &ldquo;...Ouch! Why did I do that?&rdquo; His hand
	was almost bleeding.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Shut
	up!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario hit
	lightly towards Daisy. She shot back towards Mario who returned it
	center. Toad sprung ahead in lightning speed and then the ball was
	flying back to Mario before he could prepare. He was hit in the face
	once more.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Game
	point!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	guffawed. &ldquo;&hellip; Oh wait. We&rsquo;re losing aren&rsquo;t
	we?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario was
	now extra careful, never aiming towards either Toad or Daisy
	directly and letting Bowser get aggressive up front. After several
	volleys Bowser did a power shot sending the ball like a bullet bill
	(literally) past Daisy. She did a last ditch backflip and lobbed the
	ball in the air, far enough to make a tiny shadow on the ground. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	followed the shadow. &ldquo;I got it! I got it!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No,
	I&rsquo;m standing under it!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	pushed Mario aside. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll screw it up, stupid. Move!&rdquo;
	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	shoved back. &ldquo;You move!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No!
	YOU!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The crowd
	went wild at what would be a pathetically easy shot and start of a
	comeback.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad was
	leaning against the net speaking gibberish and Daisy was standing on
	her head for no reason. Both of those things were so strange that
	Mario and Bowser let the ball bounce right between them. Both
	realizing their error at the exact same time, they swung. Thwack!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	held his snout. &ldquo;OWW YOU IDIOT PLUMBER!!!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	covered his face with both hands. &ldquo;IS IT BROKEN? I CAN&rsquo;T
	TELL!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Uncover
	it.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	did. &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	leaned up close, enough to make the plumber feel awkward. Mario
	still had that round face, large nose, and thick mustache. Bowser
	smiled. &ldquo;Yep, still ugly.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Game,
	Daisy and Toad,&rdquo; Lakitu announced. He ducked as Bowser
	affiliated crowd goers threw bags of popcorn at him. Peach was
	silently glad she was on the right side of the court in her umpire
	char.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	hung his head in shame, but there was more. Daisy was now spinning
	on her head like a break dance move, only she spun faster and
	faster. Toad stood in one place shaking violently while spilling
	unintelligible words. Before Mario could walk over there to figure
	out what was going on, Bowser pulled him aside.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Where
	do you think you&rsquo;re going??&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
	stepped up. &ldquo;Oh my! Call the medics.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Just
	in time because I quit!&rdquo; Lakitu fled as medics flooded the
	field. Some attended to Daisy who collapsed like a spin-top that's
	run out of steam and others attempted to stabilize Toad. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
	need space people!&rdquo; shout one magikoopa nurse.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Could
	have used a pause there,&rdquo; remarked his Kong ER assistant. Just
	then however, they spotted Tatanga the Space Alien in the crowds, so
	they began to pack up and evacuate Toad and Daisy out of the tennis
	court.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">How
	dare they!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	moved away from Bowser. &ldquo;Because they totally chose to have a
	medical emergency right now in a game they were easily winning.&rdquo;
	</font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Maybe!
	It could be a gambit.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Do
	you even know what that means??&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	shoved Mario back while smoke threatened to pour from his nostrils.
	&ldquo;Yes. They get the game canceled so that they can do something
	sneaky. Just because I go easy on ya half the time don&rsquo;t mean
	I&rsquo;m stupid.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	picked himself up from the ground with a grunt and joined where
	Peach was without a word. Bowser sighed as well and stood back,
	waiting impatiently with his arms crossed.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	covered his ears. &ldquo;Normally it&rsquo;s quiet up here.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Then
	Mario and Bowser lost the first set. Crowds stood up and blocked the
	view of what was happening for a moment. When they started to take
	their seats, Luigi saw medics on the field! Just when he thought
	he&rsquo;d imagined it, the crowd got excited again and Luigi&rsquo;s
	view was completely blocked by a Whomp in front of him. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
	the-?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We&rsquo;d
	better go, hehe.. Getting bad vibes.&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	nodded. Already some fights were going on down low. &ldquo;I agree,
	but how do we get out of here quick?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo took
	his hand. Luigi&rsquo;s vision went dark for a second or two then he
	was right outside the mostly vacant courtyard standing on the
	ground.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	looked around astonishingly. &ldquo;Whoa, what happened?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
	just phased through the building to come outside.&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thanks,
	buddy! Umm, we can let go now.&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo let
	go, blushing. &ldquo;Sorry, hehe. What do you think happened?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	flagged down a pianta who was leaving the stadium and asked what was
	going on.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	game is canceled, man,&rdquo; the pianta said in thick island
	accent. &ldquo;They just fell out!&rdquo; The pianta ran off. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	works with Bowser and then this? What should we do?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	got it! Go home and hide under the covers!&rdquo; Boo&rsquo;s
	invisible legs scrambled in place underneath them to run off like in
	a cartoon.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wait!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo
	turned around with a screeching tire sound effect.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Don&rsquo;t
	you want to work with me? I was going to try to beat the crowd to
	the hospital since I know that&rsquo;s where Mario&rsquo;s going to
	be.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo
	gasped and held the sides of their face. &ldquo;Y-you really want to
	work with me??&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah.
	Remember when we were the &lsquo;Scare Pair&rsquo; in Mario Party 6?
	Instead of collecting stars let&rsquo;s collect bad guys who are
	behind.. when tennis matches go bad&hellip; or something! Deal?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi and
	Boo&rsquo;s hands joined to from the official handshake of the
	bestest unlikeliest friendship.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With Toad
	and Daisy getting escorted out, the game was now definitively over.
	Peach told Mario that they would be taken to Mushroom Kingdom
	Hospital East, her very own sanctioned hospital. Soon after, little
	fights were occurring in the stands and Mario heard Peach call for
	some security to show as well. There was one problem, he and his
	brother arrived on their mach bike, but if he took it now to go to
	the hospital, he&rsquo;d be stranding his brother at the stadium.
	Mario dug in his pockets and they were empty.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario,
	I&rsquo;m here for you. I have enough for the bus, so let&rsquo;s
	go.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	turned around to see his dinosaur friend who seemed to know him
	better than he knew himself at times. &ldquo;Thanks Yoshi.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They made
	way for the exit. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it. I&rsquo;m sure one
	of these days I&rsquo;ll be repaid for how I&rsquo;m constantly
	transporting you somewhere...&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	chuckled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy you lunch. Are we even now?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
	about me??&rdquo; Bowser said, blocking the way out.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	eyed him oddly. &ldquo;Depends. What do you eat? Chinese? Greek?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	frowned. &ldquo;What are you talking about? Are you guys leaving??&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We&rsquo;re
	heading to the hospital, so you&rsquo;re free to do whatever koopa
	stuff you need to do today.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	scoffed at Mario. &ldquo;So ya just write me off? Wow!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	didn&rsquo;t think you were the clingy type.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	for a brief moment tensed up in anger but then revealed in his hands
	two crumpled cans of Fungus Up with &lsquo;Toad&rsquo; and &lsquo;Daisy&rsquo;
	on them. Mario and Yoshi stared stupidly.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">This
	is why I&rsquo;m wasting my time with you morons. I got bored and
	noticed that their locker room door was wide open with these laying
	around. Kinda weird, right? But whatever, smell ya later. Same for
	you, dinosaur breath.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sometimes
	in dreams Mario went back to that time when the Mushroom Kingdom
	felt like an alien environment. They hadn&rsquo;t devoloped mass
	transport, cellphones, or internet when he first got whizzed away to
	this strange new world. What also seemed so much more simpler were
	his hero duties and relationships with friends and foes. Was it now
	okay to speak with your arch-nemesis semi regularly on the phone? </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">As
	long as you don&rsquo;t let him get into your head, it&rsquo;s never
	bad to be in the know of whatever the koopas are doing.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Traveling
	down Starman Street was a Mushroom Bus packed like sardines. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	blinked a few times. &ldquo;How did you-?!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Quit
	acting like I haven&rsquo;t known you since you were in diapers. You
	just had that look like you were thinking about whether or not it&rsquo;s
	appropriate to talk to Bowser every other day.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	would have broke into applause where his arms not sandwiched to his
	sides. &ldquo;Could you scoot over some?&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	inched over the one inch he could scoot before he himself became
	pressed against another bus rider, specifically a giant shy guy.
	Just then the bus hit the millionth pot hole that jolted everyone
	inside.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
	always were rough transport,&rdquo; Mario jest.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	rolled his eyes. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t carpool with your brother next
	time... What do you think Bowser was mouthing off about?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	don&rsquo;t know. Some how I just woke up and knew it would be a
	weird day...&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The bus
	arrived at Mushroom Kingdom Hospital East, a flat roofed three story
	building made of stone and marble. Mario checked his phone to see
	that Luigi hadn&rsquo;t replied, but with how their YoshiMoble
	economy plan was, that was typical. He was sure his twin would show
	up eventually. He and Yoshi went inside the hospital to find the
	waiting room already full of people. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	greeted the Toad receptionist, a head nurse named &lsquo;Nass T.&rsquo;
	Her eyes were glued to charts on a computer and hand to a mouse that
	clicked and darted around the mouse pad frequently.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Are
	you ill, or do you know someone?&rdquo; she asked curtly.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey,
	this is Mario you&rsquo;re speaking to!&rdquo; said Yoshi.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She pried
	her eyes away at the mention of Mario&rsquo;s name, and the fact
	that her mouse was mysteriously disconnected from the back of the
	computer. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	dropped the mouse cord. &ldquo;Sorry. It slipped. That just keeps
	happening today.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Your
	people are in Room 444. Have a nice day!&rdquo; Nass said, like that
	was a threat.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi and
	Boo drove on the mach bike. It had a compartment on the side for
	passengers that Luigi typically occupied, but now he was the driver
	and he finally knew what it was like to be free and wild, while
	driving cautiously at the speed limit of course.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah,
	so one time some bullies beat me up other there!&rdquo; Boo pointed
	to an item shop.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	turned his head. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that the &lsquo;Toddlers-R-Us&rsquo;?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo was
	hesitant for a moment. &ldquo;...Yeah?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	nodded. &ldquo;Oh, me too! Toddlers can be fierce, especially pretty
	much all of them!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
	stopped at the Mushroom Press, a small building that provided
	offices for many local reporters and journalists with a light duty
	printing press in the back.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Let
	me speak to someone in here, then it&rsquo;s to the hospital.&rdquo;
	Luigi took off his helmet to find Boo shaking in the passenger cart.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">C-can
	I wait outside?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
	not loud or annoying in here, you know.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Can
	I just stay out here? Please??&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He walked
	in alone. The entire floor was open and plain with office cubicles
	forming little rooms and hallways. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">May
	I help you?&rdquo; the desk clerk asked.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yes
	ma&rsquo;am. Is Kylie Koopa in? She&rsquo;s a friend of Mario-&rdquo;
	</font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Right
	here!&rdquo; A female koopa with a pink shell and green hat stumbled
	out of a nearby cubicle, sending paper everywhere. Others around her
	eyed her exasperatedly. &ldquo;You gotta &lsquo;scoop&rsquo; for
	me?!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	explained what happened during the game. &ldquo;And so, yeah. I just
	thought you&rsquo;d find it interesting, that is, if you don&rsquo;t
	have other big cases you&rsquo;re looking into.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	was only researching why peanut butter and toe jam sandwiches tasted
	so good, but that don&rsquo;t compare to this!&rdquo; Kylie snapped
	a picture of him before he could react. The photo that came of out
	the Polaroid was beautiful, blank look, wrinkled clothes, and hairs
	coming out of his nose and all. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it all
	went south. Susie Que over there interviewed Mario before the game.&rdquo;
	Kylie pointed out a dark boo wearing a wig who was seated down the
	hall. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	checked his phone after it made a Flamenco music sound. &ldquo;Oh,
	that&rsquo;s Mario&rsquo;s text that he probably sent forever ago
	but it&rsquo;s just getting through. I have to go.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie did
	her signature thumb gesture. &ldquo;Contact you soon, k?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thanks
	again, and let me help you with this-&rdquo; Luigi reached down for
	some of the papers. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">NO!!&rdquo;
	Kylie dove down and snatched them up while curiously keeping an eye
	on a green capped Toad who&rsquo;s cubicle was across from hers. &ldquo;I
	mean, thanks Green but I got it!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	knocked on room 444 before stepping in.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Visiting
	hours are- Mario!?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad and
	Daisy were unconsciously laying on some cots in the room, with Peach
	sitting on a chair with tears in her eyes.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	doctor stopped stooping over where Toad and Daisy were. &ldquo;I-I
	am Doctor Professor Koopa and s-so-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	gave him a once over. He was short, shaky, and seemed more like a
	creeper play dressing as a doctor than a genuine medical
	practitioner. &ldquo;Excuse me. Who again?&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Y-you
	haven&rsquo;t heard of me?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Of
	course they have not,&rdquo; Peach said. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	took off his cap. &ldquo;These guys are tough, Princess. They&rsquo;ll
	pull through.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	agree,&rdquo; Yoshi said. Meanwhile, Doctor Professor Koopa slipped
	out of the room. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
	stood up. &ldquo;But others have been getting sick like this all
	morning and no one knows why!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Maybe
	they got too hyped up over yesterday&rsquo;s Mario Kart? Maybe a
	stomach bug is around? Coincidence?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi sat
	next to the window. &ldquo;What he said.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	went over to their beds and watched them sleep. &ldquo;We just can&rsquo;t
	speculate on the others, but we know that these two both had
	personalized soda.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wonderful
	observation. How do you know?&rdquo; Peach asked, with some color
	returning to her face.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The color
	promptly went away as she stared at Mario like he&rsquo;d grown
	another head. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Excuse
	us Princess.&rdquo; Yoshi led Mario out of the room. &ldquo;You know
	I love you Mario, but what the heck?&rdquo; he said quietly.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">But
	it&rsquo;s true. You were there.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	sighed.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	point his finger at him. &ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m just trying to help.
	That&rsquo;s literally our only clue.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	shoved his hand away. &ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t really know that
	they drank the soda right then or at all. And isn&rsquo;t it kind of
	interesting that Bowser would care enough to make a big deal of-&rdquo;
	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	stopped talking when he saw Luigi approaching from down the hall
	with a Boo following his heels.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey
	bro, I got your text but there was uh, traffic. Also I brought along
	Boo. What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	motioned towards room. They went in while Mario and Yoshi waited
	outside for a moment, neither speaking to one another because they
	assumed the other was upset at them, when in reality they weren&rsquo;t.
	So their uncomfortable silence was suddenly interrupt by commotion
	happening down the hall, complete with a familiar deep voice
	shouting.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You&rsquo;re
	a quack anyway, out here hiding under that ridiculously fake name!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I-I&rsquo;m
	calling security!&rdquo; Doctor Professor Koopa squeak, backed up
	against the wall.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Save
	it. All I wanted to know was if it was non-serious so I could win my
	tennis match soon. You do your thing with the Mario idiots. In fact,
	look at what the Cat Goomba dragged in!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	turned to face Mario, all frozen in shock. Bowser flashed that
	&lsquo;grin&rsquo; Mario was starting to see a lot lately.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Fancy
	seeing you here, plumber! Bwa ha ha!&rdquo;</font></p>

	rewritten. Yes, it get's stranger.</font></blockquote>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Somewhere
	in the outskirts of Toad Town was a rusty trailer in an open dirt
	field with a large work van parked to the side. On the trailer was
	&lsquo;M.K.D.C.U OFFICE&rsquo; painted in a colorful psychedelic
	font. Inside, a goomba dropped his MGM Grand Casino cards on the
	table, in front of the snifit and paratroopa who sat across from
	him. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	declare war,&quot; Richard Goomba the mega goomba said. He had a
	short black goatee and wore a camouflage colored jacket. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sebastian
	Bullet dropped his. &ldquo;Go-fish! Are we playing this right?&rdquo;
	His red snifit robe was normal outside of several optimistic pins
	like one that said, &lsquo;Drop 1-Ups, not Bob-ombs&rsquo;. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Who
	knows. My dad just gave me this deck of cards as a present from the
	Real World before my mother abandoned us forever. Billy, it's your
	go.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Parabilly
	Koopa was an older red shelled Paratroopa with a beat up straw hat
	on he&rsquo;d owned since the dinosaurs roamed. He left his cards
	stacked face down as he continued to type on his laptop. &quot;Skip
	me this turn. I&rsquo;m still waitin&rsquo; for a dern reply from my
	folks.&quot;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Instant
	messaging your cousins again?&quot; Richard asked. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No,
	my twin brother Probabilly. He can never decide what to send.&rdquo;
	Billy&rsquo;s computer made a ding noise. &ldquo;...Well I&rsquo;ll
	be darned. He finally sent me a coupon for half off an entree at
	Club Gamecube across from Club 64.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Gross.
	They don&rsquo;t even have any vegan dishes. Make your move
	already.&rdquo; A hand tapped Richard on the shoulder. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	have completed the mural,&quot; the tall wiggler named Wiggletron
	Berry, spoke in monotone. &ldquo;Would you like to see it?&rdquo; He
	was outwardly nondescript aside from his thick prescription glasses
	and splotches of paint all over him. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Sure,
	Wiggs. Beats these losers!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hey!&quot;
	Sebastian said. Parabilly typed away, ignoring the drama.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Gracing
	their old beat up work van was a freshly painted 'M.K.D.C.U.' like
	on the trailer. Each letter was a different color and the backdrop
	looked like a flowery explosion. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Nice!
	You&rsquo;re better than half of the hacks that call themselves
	graphic designers!&rdquo; Richard turned back towards him. &ldquo;I
	mean, your art is the only thing that lights this dump up, and I
	mean it! Jimmy&rsquo;s been promising we&rsquo;d get a real office
	for two months but look at where we still are.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wow.
	Thank you,&rdquo; Wiggs said, flushing. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Just then
	something small was kicking up dust in the air as it sped towards
	them, coming from the direction of the telegram office down the
	block. James collapsed before them gasping for air. &lsquo;Jimmy&rsquo;
	was a plump and balding monty mole in a hazmat uniform. He was also
	the founder and leader of the &lsquo;Mushroom Kingdom Disease
	Control Unit&rsquo;. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	*pant* got a *pant* urgent message. Youse won&rsquo;t believe this!&rdquo;
	</font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Breathe,
	Jimmy!&rdquo; Richard said, kicking him over.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Should
	I initiate a health evaluation?&rdquo; Wiggs said.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">James
	continued to lay on his back. &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m fine. Get the
	others and tell em we&rsquo;re hitting the road!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<hr/>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh,
	uh, princess. They didn&rsquo;t tell me you were in here. Are you
	okay?&rdquo; Luigi strut across the room with his normal lanky gate
	and stood next to the princess, just close enough to be awkward. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
	began to cheer up, finding him enduring anyway. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Do
	not fuss over me. Daisy over there needs you.&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi saw
	her and Toad lying in the cots like they were taking naps. There was
	no medical equipment attached to them bizarrely. Also, his companion
	had disappeared.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo?&rdquo;
	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo
	phased into existence, their visage tinted red. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
	sorry. I got nervous when I saw her!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
	turned to Boo. &ldquo;There is no need to fear. As long as you are
	not-&ldquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
	heard a crash outside the door. Luigi opened it and Yoshi was
	standing in the middle of the hall with his jaw dropped as Mario and
	Bowser brawled. Bowser shot his flames all around, burning the white
	interior walls black and forcing all doctors and nurses to stay
	back. Mario ran around behind him and picked him up by the tail,
	swinging him around and around. In the narrow hallway Bowser&rsquo;s
	flailing body put gashes though the drywall with each revolution.
	Bowser reached terminal throwing velocity so Mario got ready to aim
	the Koopa King at a mine, except there wasn&rsquo;t one, so the grey
	box on the wall marked &lsquo;WARNING: DO NOT TOSS TURTLES AT THIS&rsquo;
	would do.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So
	long-a Bowser!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Time
	stopped as Bowser faced him down while hanging in mid air. &ldquo;Wait,
	so that&rsquo;s what you were saying the whole time?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	only winked and did a v sign with his hands.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With a
	boom and a sizzle, Bowser&rsquo;s massive body collided with the
	circuit panel and part of the wall fell with him. All the lights in
	the entire hospital dimmed and people all around screamed in terror.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Heart
	racing and very caught up in the excitement from the fight, Mario
	looked around shiftily in the darkness. &ldquo;Oh no. This must be
	the underground level 1-2!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No,
	my dear Mario. You&rsquo;ve already reached the castle!&rdquo; Peach
	said, looking very disappointed.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	Koopa stuck a push pin on another spot on the map of Toad Town. All
	pins were somewhere close to where the stadium of the tennis match
	was, verified by her fluency with a phone book. According to the
	dozen people she bothered by calling unexpectedly, their friends and
	family got sick this morning and were consistently being checked in
	at MK East Hospital. They refused interviews however, which bummed
	her out. Kylie wondered if Susie Que, the new guy, would want to
	come along, but they seemed a bit busy in their cubical. Maybe she&rsquo;d
	help them spruce the place up some time, as it sparsely decorated
	with only a painting and the office computer.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A voice
	called Kylie from behind. She swiveled her chair around to face
	Mitch Toadstool, a green capped Toad dressed in an expensive suit.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	need to speak to you, babe.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	frowned at him. &ldquo;About what?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mitch
	leaned up. &ldquo;That new guy down there-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Susie?
	Pffft. It takes real levels of douche to talk trash about someone
	who hasn&rsquo;t even worked here for a day.&rdquo; Kylie began to
	gather her things and walk away.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mitch
	stood up as she did. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you understand. Just
	be careful, okay? -And check your sources.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What&rsquo;s
	this? Baby&rsquo;s first book report?&rdquo; She said over her
	shoulder. &ldquo;Take your own advice, greeney.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mitch
	followed her all the way to the door heading out of the Mushroom
	Press. &ldquo;Babe, you are such a stupid koopa. Listen just this
	once...&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	closed the door in his face. What a creep, Kylie thought. He had
	been a lot nicer to her recently, but the ship of them reconciling
	has sailed far away, like to Rogueport or something. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<hr/>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh,
	how wonderful,&rdquo; Peach exclaimed. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She,
	Bowser and Mario stood outside the hospital as more of the sick with
	their relatives and friends poured in the main entrance. Other than
	that, it was as warm and sunny as it was for the tennis game.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario put
	his arm around Bowser&rsquo;s back, avoiding the spikes. &ldquo;Yes.
	Just one big misunderstanding, and not us trying to casually K.O.
	each other or something.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	smiled, baring huge fangs. &ldquo;And I will never eat an entire
	couple&rsquo;s cake again with out sharing it with my wonderful
	friend,&rdquo; he said stiltedly.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Teehee!
	It&rsquo;s so adorable when you two get along!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario and
	Bowser&rsquo;s eyes met briefly with a knowing glance.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Now
	let me explain what I&rsquo;ve recently been told. Doctor Professor
	is handling &lsquo;Case X&rsquo;, the code name for whatever Toad
	and Daisy are sick with.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
	really? He used to be a professor in my castle and ran my science
	lab. Ya know, chemicals and experiments and other science stuff.&rdquo;
	Bowser said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the reason why I could teleport in
	exactly that one game where I turned your castle into an art
	gallery.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well
	when I was a little girl he was the head doctor in my castle. I
	remember him as a nice, if not shy man. He later quit and moved on.
	I don&rsquo;t see the issue.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Me
	neither,&rdquo; Mario remarked. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the food court
	serving?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The smile
	dropped off of her face. &ldquo;Nothing, because you cut the power
	and they had to delay the kitchen while waiting for the circuits to
	flip again. That reminds me, you two aren&rsquo;t allowed to enter
	again.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What?!?&rdquo;
	Mario gasped. Bowser began to walk away from them down the sidewalk.
	&ldquo;Bowser, where are you going?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	yawned. &quot;To grab a bite? Don&rsquo;t worry, my wallet&rsquo;s
	in my shell this time, moustache. Have fun.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Let
	him go,&quot; Peach said dryly. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m sorry I had to
	escort you out. If I did not, the entire staff of the hospital was
	going to quit on the spot. I&rsquo;ll keep you informed so take a
	rest in the mean time. You are looking rather stressed.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	stretched. &ldquo;Your wish is my command.&rdquo; So he head towards
	his favorite place.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Club 64
	was one of the few clubs in Toad Town that was universally loved. It
	was old timey with its wooden floors and clay walls yet modern with
	the sports bar and television sets. Mario took the short walk to
	there from the hospital and ordered a small drink as he spotted his
	rival setting alone at a table.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	seated himself across from Bowser. &ldquo;Hi.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	glanced up like he&rsquo;d seen a Boo. &ldquo;What.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
	uh&hellip; nothing. I didn&rsquo;t know you came here.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	slammed his empty coffee mug on the table and growled.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Whoa,
	okay!&rdquo; Mario got up from the bench seating. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
	want round two, huh?!&rdquo; Bowser barked, seething with anger.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	really don&rsquo;t want to get banned here too, so no.&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	let out the breath he was holding. &ldquo;Me neither. This is the
	place I can get my black as tar coffee with a pinch of cocoa.
	Waiter!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	waiter came by quaking in fear and refilled Bowser&rsquo;s coffee,
	then ran away screaming. Mario guessed it was safe to set down again
	when he noticed Bowser was smiling at him.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh
	nothing, just keep your face like that, plumber boy. Looking like a
	nervous wreck is a good look for you!&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	leaned one elbow on the table. &ldquo;Something just seems off about
	this day.&rdquo; He chugged down his Tasty Tonic. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It
	does, I mean how could I be in a tennis match and not dominate?!
	Stupid kids drinking stupid sodas right before the game...&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	thought about something while watching out the window. People walked
	by on their business, unless of course they happened to notice
	Bowser, in which they freaked out. &quot;You and I are the only ones
	that believe there&rsquo;s anything to the soda stuff. I wish I
	could have informed someone who knew what they were doing.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Then
	why don&rsquo;t you?&quot; Bowser slid aside the slightly cracked
	coffee cup and left a one coin tip. He got up from the bench.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Are
	you thinking what I&rsquo;m thinking?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;It&rsquo;s
	room 444, right? I don&rsquo;t care about your flower chick and
	fungusface, but they need to be well enough for our tennis rematch.
	That&rsquo;s right, Bowser&rsquo;s coming to town, er, hospital.
	What are you waiting for?!&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	really knew he shouldn&rsquo;t but he did. Bowser really was
	irresistible in his own way.</font></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<hr/>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi,
	Boo and Yoshi were hanging around in room 444. There was no sign of
	Doctor Professor, but after seeing how riled up the entire staff got
	while begging the Princess to ban Mario and Bowser, they really
	didn&rsquo;t want to provoke anyone.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Room
	service!&rdquo; A blue shy guy nurse came in with a tray full of
	food covered with lids.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They&rsquo;re
	still out of it.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The shy
	guy turned to Luigi. &ldquo;Sweet. That&rsquo;s been the story in
	every room on this wing and I&rsquo;m loving my job right now.&rdquo;
	He left.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Ever
	heard of people getting sick like this?&quot; Boo asked Luigi. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I&rsquo;m
	not really a doctor, so no.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi was
	near the window again. &ldquo;What he said.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The only
	noise in the room for a moment was the TV until the door crept open.
	In came a young Toad nurse with orange spots on her cap and two
	black ponytails underneath.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Sorry
	to intrude but I just heard that Bowser was here and-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	stood up, keen and alert. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? What&rsquo;s
	your name??&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Emery
	Toadstool.&rdquo; She waved. &ldquo;My mom is the head nurse here
	and I normally work on the roof. Nothing&rsquo;s wrong. I was just
	wondering about what happened to Bowser.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;He
	got kicked out,&quot; Yoshi answered, noticing the small Bowser
	emblem pinned to her uniform. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind me
	asking, why do you have a koopa troop badge on?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh
	you noticed! It&rsquo;s real and authentic and I got it from a koopa
	Mario pounded to death one day. I&rsquo;m the leader of the Bowser
	fanclub.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	fell out of his seat. &quot;Say what?!?&quot; Boo also turned paler
	if such a thing was possible.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Emery
	smiled mischievously. &quot;Let me explain guys. No, I don't support
	him kidnapping Peach but it&rsquo;s a free kingdom after all. The
	full name of the club is, &quot;Do-gooders in Appreciation of Bowser
	Baddies Club&quot;. You gotta admit Bowser is kind of cool!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	disagree, but whatever,&quot; Luigi said, respectfully. &ldquo;Since
	you&rsquo;re the daughter of the head nurse, what&rsquo;s the deal?
	We haven&rsquo;t had a doctor in here since ever!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They&rsquo;re
	calling it &lsquo;Case X&rsquo; and this entire floor is now filled
	with comatose or &lsquo;insane&rsquo; patients. Don&rsquo;t tell
	anyone I said this but my mom and Doctor Professor Koopa, her
	boyfriend -Eww! But anyway they&rsquo;re just leaving patients in
	the rooms with no treatment. I&rsquo;ve never trusted Doctor
	Professor, but I can&rsquo;t believe my mom would get in on this.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Is
	your mother also a Bowser fan?&rdquo; Yoshi blurted out. &ldquo;That
	would sound just about right with the loose morals and all!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Emery&rsquo;s
	face turned red. &ldquo;You guys are SO lame!!!&rdquo; She ran out
	and slammed the door behind her.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	went to the door and then turned around facing Luigi and Boo who
	were still gaping at his cutting remark. &ldquo;That was uncalled
	for. Sorry, it slipped. Can I use that excuse this time?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">*Creek*</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Everyone&rsquo;s
	attention turned to the window as it was being slid up. A brown boot
	appeared under the blinds and then the rest of the plumber.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Shhh!&rdquo;
	Mario said. He stuck his head outside the door and looked left and
	right. Satisfied, he then shut the door tightly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
	clear. Ready to get to the bottom of whatever this weird hospital is
	cooking?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Always
	with the food puns, but yeah bro!&rdquo; Luigi said.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Good.
	I&rsquo;m going to press this alert button on the wall and when a
	nurse answers on the intercom, we&rsquo;re going to be loud and tell
	her that we&rsquo;re all sick!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;m
	down with that,&rdquo; Yoshi said.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">One
	catch. At some point this will involve Bowser waiting outside.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;m
	not down with that,&rdquo; Yoshi said, laughing and looking like he
	was about to break.</font></p>

	Summary</font></p>
	<blockquote><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	mysteries continue!</font></blockquote>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Outside
	of Sirena Beach&rsquo;s Hotel Delfino, tourists were spread
	everywhere outdoors under umbrellas or on beach rugs to experience
	the perfect tropical weather. They payed no attention to the black
	shelled noki passing them by. He wore dark sunglasses and a red
	Hawaiian shirt. The suitcase he held was almost as big as him; he
	was the most average tourist imaginable. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Mon
	ami,&rdquo; he said to the desk clerk inside, &ldquo;Here are my
	conformation papers.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	pianta nodded and stamp his paper. &quot;Gnarly, Mr. Jelectro Bond!
	Take this.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Merci,&rdquo;
	Bond replied as he accepted his card key. He went up the stairs to
	his standard single bed room. It had all of the usual furnishings
	and a great view of the beach outside the window. Only something was
	off...</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The noki
	corrected the slightly crooked wall painting. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Perfect.&rdquo;
	He opened the suitcase up on the bed. He had flowery shirts of all
	colors, a wet suit, basic toiletries&hellip; and a silenced handgun.
	He pulled up a chair to the window and noticed the other tourists
	outdoors, getting a bit of an overload from the large group and
	almost going into a daze until he got a call.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Agent
	0064, have you arrived safely?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond
	rubbed his eyes under the glasses. &ldquo;Of course. Are you feeling
	okay, yourself?&rdquo; He sensed something uneasy in the back of his
	mind.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Not
	really,&quot; Agent N, the voice on the other line said. &quot;I was
	just alerted that my niece is sick back in the Mushroom Kingdom.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond
	stepped away from the window and closed the blinds tightly. &quot;From
	what?&quot;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That&rsquo;s
	still being determined. Never mind my issues and enjoy your
	vacation. You did just assist with a counter-terrorist operation a
	week ago.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A week
	was plenty of time to rest, Bond thought, even if he did get
	swallowed whole by a Draggadon during the mission that involved Shy
	Guys attacking an island with buckets of paint. &ldquo;Yes. Good
	times!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Uh,
	sure. Like I said, enjoy your vacation, agent,&rdquo; Agent N told
	him sternly. The call disconnected before enemy spies could trace
	their call. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Leaving
	already, dude?&quot; the pianta at the desk asked.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond
	nodded. Outside, he threw his suitcase in the back of his Aston
	Mushroom and checked his Rolex Submariner for the time. There was
	plenty of time for a guy like him to do a friend a small favor.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario&rsquo;s
	hand hovered over the red alert button.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey,
	losers!&rdquo; Bowser said from the outside the window. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
	the hold up? These bushes out here are itching me!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario,
	please delay as long as you can,&rdquo; Luigi said, snickering. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	heard that, green freak!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	pressed it anyway. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">BZZZRT.
	&ldquo;W-what is the emergency?&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	screamed gibberish into the mic.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh,
	oh no! I-I&rsquo;ll be there right away!&rdquo; Two seconds later,
	the door swung open and in came Doctor Professor Koopa.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">WHAT&rsquo;S
	GOING ON!&rdquo; Mario yelled, startling him.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Right as
	Doctor Professor turned around to flee, Yoshi and Luigi blocked the
	door. With a shriek he spun back around facing the opposite wall
	where right past Toad and Daisy was a window and Boo just standing
	around. In Boo&rsquo;s eyes the doctor looked like a hunched over,
	beastly evil koopa with jagged teeth (which were actually just bad
	fitting dentures). Boo dodged right out of the way. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Run
	right past me, please. I&rsquo;m not resisting.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	panicking doctor did just so, careening towards the window and
	jumping out of it into the bushes. Immediately after, everyone heard
	the doctor scream when Bowser emerged from the greenery holding him.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Good
	work bravely directing him straight to Bowser,&rdquo; Luigi said to
	Boo. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	shook the doctor that was powerless to escape. &ldquo;Grrr, tell us
	everything you know!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">W-we
	are trying to make all patients as comfortable as possible-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario ran
	to the window and leaned out. &ldquo;Okay, now what's the menu in
	the kitchen?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	doctor slowly craned his neck towards Mario. &ldquo;The m-menu is
	tuna!&rdquo; Doctor Professor swat away a bee, and failed, so it
	stung him on his nose. &ldquo;Ouch&hellip; T-that's what you want to
	know??&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	paused. &ldquo;That and we think Toad and Daisy had too much soda
	before the game, but that&rsquo;s it. I mean, this isn't some shady
	operation we should be worried about, right?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Basically
	that, and honestly I'm not in the mood for much more. Anybody got
	anything else to add before I drop this loser?&rdquo; Bowser asked
	disgruntledly.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wait,
	there is more,&rdquo; Luigi said. &ldquo;A nurse told us earlier
	that they're holding patients in rooms and not giving them any- Boo
	deliver the stinger!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Free
	pizza even though it's free pizza Friday!&rdquo; Boo felt great.
	They'd totally nailed it. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...Actually
	I was looking for &lsquo;treatment&rsquo;.&rdquo; Luigi pat his
	white ethereal friend on the back anyway.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	whipped back around to the doctor. &ldquo;You aren't?!!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Doctor
	Professor held his increasingly reddening nose. &ldquo;I can
	explain- THE POLICE?!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	looked all around for an escape. &ldquo;We gotta get out of here!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Every
	man for himself, Mario!&rdquo; Bowser dropped the doctor outside the
	window and fled. Doctor Professor moaned in pain but was also seen
	running away. Mario was jumping out of the window when the door was
	banged on. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	turned to the door. &ldquo;Who the heck is that?!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bam! The
	door was kicked down by a monty mole in a hazmat suit. &quot;Freeze!
	This hospital is now under the control of the Mushroom Kingdom
	Disease Control Unit!&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Everyone
	froze, including Mario whose gut was slightly too large to let him
	escape so he was just wedged there; strange because that was how
	he'd entered before with no issue. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;...Huh.
	I didn&rsquo;t expect youse to actually listen,&rdquo; Jimmy said in
	a thick Italian accent. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo&rsquo;s
	hands shot in the air. &ldquo;I'm sorry!! I spoke with my boss and
	it was only ketchup packets and not blood I'm serious!!!!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">James
	gave Boo an odd look. &ldquo;What? We&rsquo;re a sort of health
	inspector and we check if youse up to code, transport people, bust
	into places, and make a scene. Like dat.&rdquo; He pointed to the
	hospital&rsquo;s wooden door he&rsquo;d impressively toppled flat to
	the ground.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I'm
	cool with that.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">James
	whistled while squinting his eyes at some files. &ldquo;Case X is
	happenin&rsquo; here I see. And dis is the Toad Toad and Princess
	Daisy Bloom we're looking for. Do a check and then wheel em out,
	boys!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wiggletron
	and Parabilly walked in. Yoshi, who gave the aforementioned
	approval, had nothing against it. They both went to Toad and Daisy
	and began to do a basic check up.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Where
	are you wheeling them?&rdquo; Luigi asked. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And
	where is the free pizza??&rdquo; the half of Mario&rsquo;s body that
	was still in the room inquired.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	Toadley Clinic,&rdquo; James answered. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	blinked. &ldquo;Does that answer my question or his?&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yes.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No one
	could say anything to whatever logic puzzle that was. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Examination
	complete,&rdquo; Wiggs said. &ldquo;Subject has rapid heartbeat and
	dilated eyes.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Darn
	tootin&rsquo;! Same with this other one,&rdquo; said the parakoopa.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wheel
	em out, then. It&rsquo;s a mad house here. M.K.D.C.U. out!&rdquo;
	James slipped out with significantly more grace then he entered.
	Wiggletron and Parabilly wheeled the beds out of the door, and that
	was that until, like she materialized out of some dark corner of the
	universe, a middle aged toad woman with orange spots and long black
	hair appeared in the open doorway. Everyone instantly recognized her
	as Nass. T. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;m
	going to have to ask you all to leave,&rdquo; she hissed, &ldquo;And
	you can NEVER come back!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	Koopa stepped off the mushroom bus at Mushroom Kingdom East
	Hospital. A truck vibrantly decorated with &lsquo;MKDCU&rsquo; was
	parked right in front and a burly looking mega goomba guarded the
	entrance, though he didn&rsquo;t really deny or grant anyone&rsquo;s
	access. He just sort of stood there looking busy.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What&rsquo;s
	going on here?&rdquo; Kylie asked the snifit driver of the truck.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sebastian
	leaned his head up. &ldquo;Oh, hello?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Howdy.
	I&rsquo;m Kylie Koopa, ace reporter. Gotta moment to spare-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sebastian
	got excited. &ldquo;The famous Kylie??? What&rsquo;s the secret to
	your amazing lips?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	smiled. &ldquo;You got the wrong Kylie, whatever you're talking
	about so-&rdquo; She heard a whistle behind her and thought for a
	moment it might be someone cute, but it wasn&rsquo;t.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Richard
	diverted his eyes quickly. &ldquo;Umm, I wasn&rsquo;t checking you
	out or nothing.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	brain stormed. None of this seemed normal for the &lsquo;best
	hospital around&rsquo;, and this wasn&rsquo;t even touching whatever
	the illness was supposed to be. Just then, the door was swung open,
	and Richard was launched several feet away into some bushes as a
	Whomp and koopatrol guard dumped Mario and his friends out of the
	building. Luigi, Yoshi, Boo, and Mario whose body was attached to a
	window frame ripped out of the wall all fell on top of each other
	and tumbled down the few steps to the bottom. It was a prime
	opportunity for an embarrassing photo, so that&rsquo;s exactly what
	Kylie snapped.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wow!
	What a scoop!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi,
	who was at the bottom, pushed everyone off of him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
	do photos!&rdquo; he lashed out. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie put
	the camera down. &ldquo;Umm. I&rsquo;ll just be&hellip; over there!&rdquo;
	She very conspicuously ran off into the bushes that lined the side
	of the building.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	rubbed his head. &ldquo;Yoshi, she&rsquo;s on the case.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	glared. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care! This kind of stuff wouldn&rsquo;t
	happen if we didn&rsquo;t let koopas vote.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario was
	quick to frown in offense. &ldquo;That was very speciesist, Yoshi.
	Keep that attitude up, and you&rsquo;ll never get free pizza.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	groaned loudly and walked away to the left. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	remained fixated in the direction Yoshi went. &ldquo;He had a point
	though. There was no need to get Kylie in on this.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi&rsquo;s
	moustache twitched in annoyance so he also began to walk away, this
	time to the right which lead to the city. Mario and Boo followed
	him.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Little
	brother, don&rsquo;t walk away from me.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	responded in the same way he always when Mario used that tone: by
	ignoring the point and being immature. &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re a
	stupid-head that let&rsquo;s Bowser get loose with a magic eraser!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	heard that again, Green!&rdquo; Bowser came out of nowhere to
	confront them all. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Leave
	us alone,&rdquo; threatened the half plumber half window frame
	hybrid. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo and
	Luigi knew that this was getting ugly and pressed themselves against
	a building on the sidewalk. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Don&rsquo;t
	speak to me, Red. We&rsquo;re through!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario got
	in Bowser&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make me your doubles
	partner again then! Why did you wait around here for us anyway?!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">To
	tell you to you tell your useless friends to not call in sick!&rdquo;
	Bowser shoved him hard against a telephone pole, cracking the frame
	and sending glass shards everywhere. Mario saw red, and not just
	because he was upset. There were some small cuts on his face.
	Bowser&rsquo;s ferocious grimace faltered slowly at the not so E
	rated injury. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Umm,
	moustache-&rdquo; Was all Bowser was able to say before a fist
	socked him. So unexpected was this, that the next thing he
	remembered was staring up at clouds, at least until Mario grabbed
	his collar.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Say
	something like that about my friends again, and I&rsquo;ll ship you
	back to Dark Land in pieces!&rdquo; Mario leaned up and stomp off
	down the street. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	was for a second speechless until a stock rebuttal came out. &ldquo;No!
	You are! Wait, that doesn&rsquo;t fit. Uh, I hate you too!&rdquo;
	Bowser got up and saw the scene he was making. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi and
	Boo, who&rsquo;d seen the entire train wreck, slowly retraced their
	steps to the hospital, grabbed the Mach bike, and went for some
	lunch, hoping this was some sort of bad dream.</font></p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser&rsquo;s
	Castle...</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
	koopaling with a blue mohawk took off his headphones and lay his
	laptop next to him on the couch. The ocean princess koopaling was on
	the floor playing the Playstation 4. &ldquo;Hey, cut that out with
	all those downloads. You&rsquo;re making the internet connection too
	slow!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hold
	on Larry, gosh!&rdquo; Wendy replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to get
	my account set up.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Can&rsquo;t
	you use Iggy&rsquo;s like you always do?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;m
	totes offended you would suggest a that! Don&rsquo;t you know what
	problematic games he has? I have to redownload my personal games
	right now on my own account. Plus, I have privileges and you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
	sigh and lay back. &ldquo;Who knew you&rsquo;d claim a &lsquo;privilege&rsquo;
	since you never shut up about it...&rdquo; He knew she was actually
	referring to her phone and videogame privileges that were rarely
	revoked unlike her brethren, but it was the burn that counted, and
	he snickered as she rolled her eyes.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	intercom that was in every main room of Bowser&rsquo;s Castle buzzed
	with Ludwig&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Attention! All koopalings meet in
	&lsquo;the room&rsquo;, now!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Nope!&rdquo;
	Larry stuck his tongue out at the box.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Uh
	huh, Luddy can wait. I don&rsquo;t know why he&rsquo;s been so
	&lsquo;extra&rsquo; lately. Gosh!&rdquo; Wendy proceeded to download
	&lsquo;Princess Parlor 7&rsquo;.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wonderful
	for some of us to be here,&rdquo; Ludwig said as he sat on a
	homemade throne carved from imported Yoshi&rsquo;s Island trees that
	he had in &lsquo;the room&rsquo; for some reason. The room was a
	random broom closet the Koopalings used for secret meetings. The
	secret room used to be in a better more convenient place that didn&rsquo;t
	have a bad smell, like the kitchen, but that wasn&rsquo;t very
	secret. Before him were only Roy, Lemmy, and Morton.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	got koopaball practice today. Make it quick.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	shall make this as lengthy as it needs to be!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Roy shot
	up and gave his eldest brother a noogie, completely ruining his
	styled hair.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Stop
	that or I will destroy you!!&rdquo; Ludwig pushed him away. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">But
	I need the time. I&rsquo;m starting a book club, you know? I&rsquo;ve
	been talking online on Facenote, Instaham, and Twatter, plus I have
	fifteen or sixteen other pinpals from Dinosaur Land to Ricco
	Harbor,&rdquo; Morton explained. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
	are we even doing again?&rdquo; Lemmy asked, twirling a broom handle
	between his fingers. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
	are here because of the plan!!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Morton
	snapped his fingers like he caught on. &ldquo;...I&hellip;I&hellip;
	Oh no, I lost it. Can I have a hint?&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	sighed heavily. &ldquo;Take a guess. Wait, do not. You might spread
	some of your stupid.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So
	does King Dad not know &lsquo;bout this or something?&rdquo; Roy
	asked. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Correct.
	Vater does not know at this moment what our plans are for the day
	and it would be advisable to keep the status quo. Meeting is
	adjourned.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
	raised his hand. &ldquo;&hellip; So this means I can&rsquo;t text
	King Dad to tell him how good my day is right now?&rdquo; Lemmy held
	his cellphone with different colored buttons and a pink plastic
	shell.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy,
	your phone is a nonfunctional toy and cannot do such a thing anyway.
	Besides, you just turned twenty-two last month. I thought Vater was
	going to get you a real cellular phone?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	rainbow haired koopaling nodded and revealed a second phone, this
	time a real one that had a huge touch screen and was super
	expensive. The plastic wrap was still on it. &ldquo;I know, but this
	new one is boring. So can I pretend to text Dad or not? I&rsquo;m
	still not getting the rules.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	felt his face get hot, which apparently was perceivable easily.
	Lemmy, Morton, and even Roy quickly left his sight.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	Koopa, now covered in grass and dirt, lifted up from the bushes once
	things quiet down, only to get another shock.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
	jerked her hand away from the guards, who had Nass with them. They
	stood at the entrance. &ldquo;How can you do this?&rdquo; she
	protest.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
	is just the new rules.&rdquo; Nass delivered the line like one would
	a terminal illness.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">New
	rules? Since when??&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Last
	month. The medical board decided so.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">But-
	I was not invited to anything a month ago.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Nass put
	the clipboard under her arm. &ldquo;Yes. You have been silently
	dissociated from this hospital. We discussed that we felt having
	your affiliation was no longer needed to provide the best care for
	all of our patients and staff. Also, it&rsquo;s an outdated concept.
	It is a free kingdom.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach&rsquo;s
	jaw threatened to hit the floor. &ldquo;THIS is providing the best
	care??&rdquo; She waved a hand back inside where the chaos in the
	hospital was visible from the glass. &rdquo;And then you take
	advantage of my generosity with the freedoms you enjoy? Oh my!&rdquo;
	she said grimly.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">One of
	the guards, a whomp with an eye patch, chuckled. &ldquo;Heh heh. All
	you did was stand around and look pretty anyway.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Once
	Peach had walked away, Kylie came right up. &ldquo;May I have an
	interview ya&rsquo;ll?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Nass
	turned her back. &ldquo;Security!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And next
	Kylie knew, she was being body slammed by the whomp and koopatrol.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoiks!&rdquo;
	she said from underneath the pile up. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Pick
	on someone your own size, losers!&rdquo; Richard came out of the
	truck to tackle the whomp over, sending his slap body hard against
	the pavement. The koopatrol got up to be headbutt by Richard. Both
	guards had to run in, which was convenient since the fight happened
	on the front porch of a hospital, but it had to have still ruined
	their day a bit. Kylie rolled over out of breath but glad to be
	alive. Did this ratty looking goomba that saved her deserve another
	chance?</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh,
	snap! Ha! Get it? Because you probably can&rsquo;t walk now?&rdquo;
	Richard said over her body.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Never
	mind, she wasn&rsquo;t interested. And worse yet, he was almost
	right. Her everything ache something fierce.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie got
	up. &ldquo;Thanks, brother&hellip; I think. Nice fire flower on that
	tool belt. You trained with it?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Richard
	puffed his chest out. &ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Even
	with no hands?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
	trained for that smart mouth of yours?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	rolled her eyes. &ldquo;Forget it, Dick.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That&rsquo;s
	what I thought, sis&hellip; How did you know my name by the way?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">HEEEAAALLLPPP!&rdquo;
	someone that sounded a lot like Parabilly screamed from Richard&rsquo;s
	radio. There was the sound of commotion in the background until a
	calmer voice spoke up. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
	require immediate assistance, thank you.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
	sounds like Wiggs,&rdquo; Richard thought out loud. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Who?&rdquo;
	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Richard
	rushed indoors. Since that snifit was asleep again in the truck and
	she did owe him one (and she had to find a &lsquo;scoop&rsquo;
	somehow) she followed. The halls were densely packed with a mix of
	civilian and staff. Then, a group of people ran from the west wing.
	Hobbling along with her newly acquired bruises, she followed where
	ever people seemed to be running from to eventually find herself in
	the middle of a stand off. This wing of the hospital had walls
	brightly painted with ABCs and toys laying around. The MKDCU, minus
	Richard, cowered as Toad and Daisy flung random toys at them like a
	game of dodge ball. She didn&rsquo;t see the medical emergency. Time
	for another photo.</font></p>
	<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Click&rsquo;
	The photo was snapped, illuminating the room for one second. Toad
	and Daisy faced her way with red eyes and foam at the mouth. Maybe
	there was a little bit of a medical emergency...</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Way
	to go, random lil thang!&rdquo; Parabilly, who&rsquo;s legs were
	shaking in fear, said.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Affirmative.
	They can chase her with their dangerously enhanced strength and
	aggression that allows them to tear through almost anything in this
	&lsquo;coma walking&rsquo; state,&rdquo; Wiggletron explained.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">When
	Kylie screamed and ran off, to her horror Toad and Daisy went along
	with her. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Like some
	sort of reverse magnet, people were repelled away from Kylie as she
	ran back through the same hallways. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Smart
	move, going in there before me,&rdquo; Richard said as he ran along
	side her.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What&rsquo;s
	going on??&rdquo; Kylie exclaimed.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hold
	on.&rdquo; Kylie got a notebook and then a pen, holding these items
	steadily even while running. &ldquo;Okay, brother. You can explain
	now.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Just
	follow me.&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Richard
	ran to the East wing of the hospital, knocking over anyone in his
	way while Kylie and her rabid tag-alongs followed. Catch me if you
	can as they would say, or in this case, catch me and.. Kylie didn&rsquo;t
	want to even think about if they got caught. Down another hall Kylie
	could hear ruckus from several of the patient rooms, and wondered if
	those were &lsquo;Case X&rsquo; patients. Soon they completed the
	circle and were right back where they started at the front entrance.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Richard
	kicked open the doors where the back of the MKDCU truck was now
	facing the opening. He dodged to the side nimbly while Kylie blindly
	ran in the van and into a huge cage. When Toad and Daisy followed
	her, a second later Richard hit a switch that made a trap door close
	on Toad and Daisy but not Kylie.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">AHHHHHHHHHHH!&rdquo;
	Kylie then realized she was safe and stared blankly. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">All of
	the MKDCU were now in the car: Sebastian drove, Jimmy was in the
	passenger seat, Wiggletron, Richard, and Parabilly were in the
	middle row, and Kylie was setting around dazed in back area with the
	cage.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thanks
	again, shortie. Want my number?&rdquo; Richard jolted her by asking.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	leaned into the backseat compartment. &ldquo;Did ya&rsquo;ll just
	use me as bait?!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Richard,
	no flirting on the job. Hit the road!&rdquo; Jimmy said. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie was
	pushed out the van and left her on the curb. She felt like pulling
	out her hair so she snatched off her hat to feel something more like
	a smooth dome. She felt mightily stupid as she remembered she was
	bald. Back on the noggin the headgear went before someone noticed,
	like the rather handsome Noki walking down the sidewalk. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jelectro
	Bond?!&rdquo; Kylie covered her mouth.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond
	approached and smiled. &ldquo;Long time no see, Kylie.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	shook his hand. &ldquo;Sorry to scream your name out like that.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It
	is fine, but do remember that I am kind of off duty right now,&rdquo;
	he said in a low voice. &ldquo;Hold on.&rdquo; The noki went inside
	for a moment and then came right back out. &ldquo;Just what I
	feared, there are no visiting hours established yet.&rdquo; Bond
	took her arm in his. &ldquo;But since my immediate plans are
	delayed, I supposed we could take a ride.&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie&rsquo;s
	eyes lit up. She knew Bond professionally as a very peculiar guy, in
	a good way.</font></p>

	<blockquote><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	plot thickens...</font></blockquote>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi and
	Boo were setting on a bench in Toad Town while Boo searched
	something on their web browser.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">People
	are saying on some message boards that the sick are getting up and
	walking.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	hummed as he stared at clouds. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t that mean
	there&rsquo;s a quick recovery? They are just sick, not dead.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well,
	the people online are sure acting like they are. Also, it&rsquo;s
	not just walking, it&rsquo;s attacking.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	shivered. &ldquo;Looks like getting kicked out was a good thing. Now
	what? Check on Toad and Daisy or head to the castle for backup?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Whatever
	you think I guess..&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	rubbed under his chin. &ldquo;Mario said something about soda that
	was personalized but that&rsquo;s exactly our only clue. Maybe it
	had a bad mix with whatever else they&rsquo;d had that morning. I&rsquo;d
	check with Merlon but I&rsquo;m Luigi and not Mario and I have
	crippling anxiety.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo
	smiled. &ldquo;I like you better that way.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	flushed. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to flatter me. Let&rsquo;s head
	to the castle. There&rsquo;s a guy there who would know all about
	how caffeine and drugs mix. E rated drugs, I mean...&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Soon they
	had made the short trip from Toad Town to Peach&rsquo;s Castle, a
	three story medieval aged castle located off of Royal Raceway and
	the sanctuary of Peach&rsquo;s lineage for several generations. The
	area was peaceful and the moat was half filled.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi and
	Boo pulled the mach bike up to the teenage Toad guarding the door.
	He played a Nintendo DS while the spear he was supposed to be armed
	with at all times was leaning on the wall, complete with a spider
	web on it.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey
	Thomas. Any news?&rdquo; Luigi asked.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thomas
	pried his eyes away from the game. &ldquo;Hey, Green Mario. Peach is
	inside crying. Don&rsquo;t go in.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi did
	a double take. &ldquo;She is? Why??&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thomas
	went back to the game. &ldquo;The hospital is independent now.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">How
	can they do that when she&rsquo;s the princess and she founded it?
	Anyway, where&rsquo;s Gold?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">In
	the back.&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi led
	Boo around the back of the castle, where there was a hedge fence
	encircling Peach&rsquo;s garden, full of colorful flowers, a central
	Eternal Star water fountain, and white outdoor furniture for guests
	and castle employees to enjoy the scenery. Flutters circled in the
	sky around the greenery and the area smelt sweet. </font>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Among the
	foliage was a yellow capped toad named Alagold, and a blue one named
	Buckenberry. Alagold was currently wrestling with a water hose gone
	wild and Buckenberry was neck deep in an overgrown shrub, trying to
	trim it down at the same time. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey
	guys,&rdquo; Luigi said. Alagold and Buckenberry turned their
	attention to them.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
	great, another boo in the courtyard,&rdquo; Buckenberry groaned.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi put
	a hand around Boo. &ldquo;No, this is a friend.&rdquo; Boo waved.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">..Anyway,&rdquo;
	Luigi continued, &ldquo;Can I speak to you Gold?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Alagold
	let the hose go. &ldquo;Totally, bro. I hate working back here
	because my phone gets no reception and I can&rsquo;t goof off.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Buckenberry
	dropped the clippers, looking dejected. &ldquo;Umm, do you need me
	too?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No
	not really.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Buckenberry
	sighed and went back to clipping, though he was listening in anyway.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	told Alagold about the tennis match and the soda clue. &ldquo;Could
	drinking, I think it was personalized FungusUp that Yoshi mentioned,
	cause them to fall out?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Alagold
	was swatting away flies that didn&rsquo;t exist. &ldquo;Possibly if
	they mixed it up with too many mushrooms first and I know Mr. Toad,
	so that&rsquo;s possible. I like your starry hat, dude.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo
	pointed to themselves. &ldquo;Really? Thanks, hehe. Except, there&rsquo;s
	nothing on my head.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
	should go to FungusUp and ask to see their nutritional list!&rdquo;
	Buckenberry said, like it was a casual thought, though he really
	just wanted to be involved somehow.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Great
	idea, bro.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
	could do that, but I don&rsquo;t have enough room on the bike for
	all of us.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo
	pulled out a bag full of coins. &ldquo;I got this from tips on my
	weekday job. Will this cover the fair?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	can&rsquo;t ask for your money, Boo.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	can,&rdquo; Alagold said. &ldquo;I spent my last paycheck on
	mushrooms.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And
	so I had to pay your half of the rent again,&rdquo; Buckenberry
	said, annoyed.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Don&rsquo;t
	you live in the castle?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Not
	anymore Luigi, bro. We moved out because it was getting weird living
	here.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Actually
	they got tired of Gold tripping. Our new apartment is cool though. I
	can come with you guys, right Luigi??&rdquo; Buckenberry asked,
	failing to hide his desperation.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
	Sherlock Luigi now.&rdquo; Luigi pulled up a magnifying glass and
	wore a detective&rsquo;s cap. &ldquo;The game is afoot!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	arrived at the Mario residence, a cozy one bedroom home. He knocked
	on the door a few times but it was quiet inside. Since the lights
	were also out, Yoshi started to walk away before he heard the door
	opening.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario?
	You look...terrible!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	unhappily stood in the doorway with little white bandages all over
	his face. &ldquo;What do you need?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	took a step forward. &ldquo;Just checking up on you.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	retreated inside, leaving the door open. Yoshi took it as an
	invitation to follow. Inside the home it was dark and cold feeling.
	Mario was sitting at the kitchen table with his head leaning on his
	elbow. &ldquo;Bowser is such a douche&hellip;&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	agree. He did that to you, right?&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well,
	of course.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	took a seat and revealed a mail in coupon book, sliding it to Mario.
	&ldquo;So, I got this in the mail the other day. I&rsquo;ll let you
	pick the restaurant. You were going to treat me, right?&rdquo; Yoshi
	nudged him.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hmm,
	would you have let me vote on it if I was a koopa?&rdquo; Mario
	scooted it back.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	crossed his arms. &ldquo;Listen, that was dumb for me to say, okay?
	Something about that entire place just made me be pissed.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario up
	and swung the refrigerator open. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not the only
	one. I feel like I have that &lsquo;Anger&rsquo;s Power&rsquo; badge
	on that I thank Eldstar didn&rsquo;t make it in any game. I&rsquo;m
	not hungry.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oookay,
	so why are you holding that stiff looking left over pizza?&rdquo;
	Yoshi smirked.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	froze with the pizza in his hand. &ldquo;I have to make up for the
	free pizza I was cheated out of!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After a
	moment of silence, the dinosaur laughed. &ldquo;Mario, you&rsquo;re
	a fat idiot. I love you so much! I&rsquo;m sorry for everything
	okay? Just stop being angry.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario sat
	back down with a notably better disposition. &ldquo;I was being a
	jerk too. Let&rsquo;s just start over. What should we do?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	thought for a moment. &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m eating my words from
	before, but the only thing we know about Toad and Daisy is that they
	had super rare FungusUp with their names on them.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It
	is and the corporation isn&rsquo;t that far. You thinking of
	stopping there?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	scanned over his coupon book again. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want my
	dinner to be soda, but hey, I need to stop being the old man of the
	group.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You&rsquo;re
	not old, you&rsquo;re fourty-five.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	closed the book. &ldquo;Yes. And my daily trips from Yoshi&rsquo;s
	Island to the Mushroom Kingdom aren't getting any shorter. If only
	someone gave me something in town, you know, since I&rsquo;m always
	helping the Princess out.&rdquo; Yoshi winked.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	knew where that was going, and could already hear Peach&rsquo;s
	rants about why Yoshi would not be able to stay in the castle. &ldquo;Umm&hellip;
	we&rsquo;ll see. Let me leave a note for my brother too. I think he
	still has the bike.&rdquo;</font></p>

	<hr/>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond&rsquo;s
	luxurious Aston Mushroom was parked in a secluded parking garage
	somewhere. Before then, they&rsquo;d simply drove around town to
	waste time and Kylie didn&rsquo;t mind it one bit. Bond had given
	her anonymous interviews on odd things from time to time, as the
	agent seemed to only specialize in the strange. Why he was getting
	bothered by a little illness breakout she didn&rsquo;t know, but
	with how handsome and mysterious he was for a shorter guy, she
	didn&rsquo;t care.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Uh
	huh, so I snapped this picture. It&rsquo;s crazy right?&rdquo; Kylie
	showed Bond the photo of Toad and Daisy before they attacked.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond held
	it close and became fixated for a moment.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">One
	of those weirdo health agents that kicked me out called it &lsquo;coma
	walking&rsquo; and I know that&rsquo;s a thing that involves
	Mushroom Flu. Do you think there&rsquo;s an outbreak again?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond
	handed the photo back. &ldquo;According to records all natural
	strands of Mushroom Flu were eradicated by Dr. Mario. For it to come
	up again would have to be very deliberate would it not?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser&rsquo;s
	Lab has all kinds of crazy viruses stored up. It&rsquo;s a stretch
	but it could be our only lead, only I haven&rsquo;t snooped around
	Dark Land since that chain-chomp ate my car.&rdquo; Kylie snapped.
	&ldquo;Wait a minute. A new co-worker of mine named Susie Que came
	from Dark Land. Yeah, maybe they&rsquo;ve heard about something
	local. Think we could stop there?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond hit
	the push button transmission and smiled. &ldquo;Certainly, mon ami.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	buckled up. &ldquo;K. Just watch out for my ex boyfriend, Mitch
	Toadstool.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Of
	the Mushroom Enquirer magazine?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	shrugged. &quot;Yeah. He didn&rsquo;t always have a taste for
	garbage, we were both into the 'risky scoops' in the day. Think
	aliens, secret projects, freaks, etc. We kind of started out
	together and struggled together. But.. enough of that...&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After
	dealing with Toad Town traffic for fifteen minutes Bond pulled up to
	the front of the Press. Inside most reporters were out doing
	afternoon projects or preparing for the evening. Kylie went to
	Susie&rsquo;s cubical. There was nothing there but their assigned
	computer and a little 10x8 watercolor photo. Susie had nothing else
	going on or indicators of where they&rsquo;d went, but she did find
	the computer wasn&rsquo;t shut off completely when she accidentally
	touched the mouse, waking it up. On the screen was random flash
	games and a voice changer app. Oh well, nothing of interest, and yes
	Kylie was admitting to being nosy. She began to head out when she
	saw that Bond was over where Mitch was on the opposite side of the
	press.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond
	turned around. &ldquo;Ready?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah,
	Susie ain&rsquo;t here. Are you bothering Bond?&rdquo; Kylie asked
	Mitch.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	have no time for you,&rdquo; he replied nastily, not even turning
	away from his own computer screen.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	rotten mushroom,&rdquo; Kylie said once she was back in the car.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond
	began to drive off. &ldquo;He is just conflicted,&rdquo; he said
	cryptically. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;m
	conflicted often as to whether I want to punch him, so yeah, sounds
	right.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond did
	not share her humor. &ldquo;I need to visit the hospital again.
	Someone I know is sick and it is of upmost importance.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond took
	her back to MK East and like before, he was returning to the parking
	lot almost as soon as he entered. He got back into the Aston
	Mushroom pinching his forehead. &ldquo;That nurse was hiding
	something from me but I could not stick around long enough to get it
	out!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	stared. &ldquo;What?? I&rsquo;m trying to crack this case too, so if
	you know something, I&rsquo;ll all ears!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond lay
	a grappling hook in her lap. &ldquo;If you really want your story,
	stick with me until this afternoon. They are not letting anyone
	visit any Case X patient so we will simply have to sneak in from the
	roof!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	gulped. But it was for the scoop. She had to hang in there.</font></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<hr/>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	Toadley Clinic was a hospital run by Doctor Toadley, his bird, and
	his intern that specialized in anything too &lsquo;odd, strange, or
	dangerous for normal hospitals&rsquo;&hellip; and also Dr. Toadley
	was good with landmines. The eccentric completed the preliminary
	examination Toad and Daisy, who lay on beds on one side of the lab
	while Toadley worked in the other. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
	ain&rsquo;t good,&rdquo; James said, catching a glimpse of a results
	paper that read inconclusive.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Do
	not believe only what your eyes see. Do our patients have
	unconsciousness, coma walking, and a lack of a rash? Yes!&rdquo;
	Toadley turned towards James suddenly, making his purple robe flow
	in the air. &ldquo;It is simple.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">James
	stood up straight. &ldquo;Hey, youse the expert. Lay it on me.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It
	is the MUSHROOM FLU!&rdquo; His words echoed in the lab.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">James
	gaped. &ldquo;&hellip; Dat&rsquo;s what we were fearing!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadley
	faced his testing equipment again. &ldquo;Do I need much time for
	testing? Yes.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sure
	doc. Guess dis is in your hands now, eh? How youse gonna be paying
	us?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadley
	continued working. &ldquo;Pay? We do not pay YOU here. Don&rsquo;t
	people pay you to bring me patients so that they can pay me? I
	believe so!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">James
	started. &ldquo;But our client was your intern! She told us people
	were sick at MK East and if we didn&rsquo;t get em outta there,
	they&rsquo;d be pushing up daisies!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadley
	shrugged. &ldquo;Has Mary messaged anyone today? No. Now be gone.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">On cue,
	Toadley&rsquo;s white little bird named Birdley swooped down from
	it&rsquo;s perch, and straight towards Jimmy&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Squawk!
	Time to go! Time to go!&rdquo; Birdley repeated.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Back
	off birdbrains!&rdquo; Birdley harassed James until he tumbled
	through the double doors that separated the lab from the lobby area.
	&ldquo;Boys!&rdquo; he said desperately as he was sprawled out.
	&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been stuck up!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	members of the MKDCU all stopped what they were doing. Richard threw
	the &lsquo;Kart and Driver&rsquo; magazine he was reading down and
	sprung up from his seat. &ldquo;By who? Let me at the punk!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">James
	pointed towards Mary the intern, a pink capped Toad with short
	blonde hair who was idly reading a book at the front desk. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
	you&rsquo;ve got to be kidding me. What did I do this time?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
	sent this!&rdquo; James slapped a wrinkly telegram on her desk.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	glanced at it once. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have that kind of machine
	here, sir. In fact, the only one I know of is at MK East hospital.
	So back off before I let Birdley in here.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">James
	sighed in defeat. &ldquo;Now what? We skipped lunch over dis!&rdquo;
	</font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey
	Jimmy,&rdquo; Parabilly spoke up, &ldquo;I still got that coupon for
	Club Gamecube! They serve all day.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Nooooo!&rdquo;
	Richard cried. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wiggletron
	stretched his arms. &ldquo;That would not be displeasing.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah
	and they put on shows. Totally cool!&rdquo; Sebastian added.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Any

	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Darn

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser&rsquo;s
	Castle </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kamek
	groaned when he opened the refrigerator and found not one &lsquo;peanut
	butter and toe jam&rsquo; sandwich left. The moment Bowser left that
	morning for his tennis match, nothing was getting done anywhere in
	the castle, not the army drills, not the garbage collection, and not
	the pet cleanup. Kamek was in an outrage, and he&rsquo;d protest by
	taking a nap and doing nothing about it himself, like he always did.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Greetings,
	gro&szlig;vater.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kamek
	jumped. &ldquo;Prince Ludwig??.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	stood with his normal arrogant stance, arms behind his back. &ldquo;It
	is I. I wished to inquire about the keys to the airship. I cannot
	find them anywhere.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Why?
	King Bowser took the bus to the Mushroom Kingdom this morning.&rdquo;
	Kamek settled on a disgusting &lsquo;peanut butter and jelly&rsquo;
	sandwich and closed the fridge. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	know where he went, now where is it?!&rdquo; he asked sharply.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kamek
	shot the twenty-three year old a look. &ldquo;Watch your tone with
	me, young man. If I had my scepter I'd zapped you into a
	microgoomba.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	laughed harshly. &ldquo;And if I was willing to poison my mind with
	social media like Facenote, I'd let the world know that you taped
	over last year's Koopaball game everyone was looking forward to and
	that you have been seeing other female magikoopas behind Kammy&rsquo;s
	back.&rdquo; Ludwig began to look serious. &ldquo;Give me the
	blasted keys, gro&szlig;vater. Your attempt to obfuscate reveal your
	guilt.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The blue
	robed elder eyes narrowed. If there was one thing that didn't work
	on him, it was empty threats that involved the internet. After all,
	what even was that? &ldquo;I do know where they are, but oh dear, it
	appears Kammy had it on her keychain.. And she won't be back until
	tonight.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	seized up for a moment like a cobra about to strike. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So
	again, why?&rdquo; Kamek took a bite of the trash in bread form and
	cringed. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Our
	kidnapping plan for tonight! Eldstar, did none of you take even a
	second's glance at the bulletin board post in the front of the
	castle where I detailed all of the steps in invisible ink??&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
	neat.&rdquo; Kamek struggled to not gag as he swallowed the sweet
	tasting rubbish. &ldquo;I will be going with you children. Thank
	you.&rdquo; Kamek left the kitchen after throwing the sandwich
	wrapper in a garbage can that was overfilled.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	stomp to the basement so heatedly he thought his footsteps might
	melt the stairs. Down there was Bowser&rsquo;s lab, a dimly lit
	concrete room with lots potion shenanigans and LAN parties oddly
	enough occurred. Ludwig slam the door open.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy,
	wearing a white coat, spun around. &ldquo;Luddy? What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;
	On the table before him was a microscope and chicken scratch notes

	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Quick,
	check the Toad Town message boards!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy
	shrugged and started typing on his gaming computer. &ldquo;Want to
	test something out in the meantime?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Absolutely
	not,&rdquo; Ludwig said, leaning over his shoulder. &ldquo;There!
	Stop. Hmm&hellip; The general public are still quiet ignorant. It
	appears the delay might not be detrimental.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy
	wasn&rsquo;t really paying attention as he switched the tab over to
	some internet videos. &ldquo;Sure. So&hellip; you know any girls who
	might want to visit a comic-con with a nice genius like me?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	frowned. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know any girls!...That would want to
	go out with you, I mean,&rdquo; he added awkwardly. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Phew!
	I thought you were saying that you knew no females, which would be
	very sad for a normal looking guy like you who isn&rsquo;t legally
	insane and has nice clothes and gold Parade Kart.&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	noticed some cans of soda in the corner, some Fungus Up, Moral

	are those cans still here?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy

	Bowser's Outside Story</font></h2>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Chapter
	Summary</font></p>
	<blockquote><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Short
	but important.</font></blockquote>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	tossed another dart at Mario. The metal tipped barb dug in only a
	centimeter deep and missed Mario&rsquo;s left arm. He was in Toad
	Town&rsquo;s park with his &lsquo;favorite&rsquo; poster of Mario
	(for motivation!) crudely taped to an unfortunate tree. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sir?&rdquo;
	someone said as Bowser was getting ready to throw another dart.
	Bowser turned to face a Toad in park ranger uniform. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Umm,
	w-we&rsquo;re getting complaints that you&rsquo;re uh, scaring the
	children and-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	ripped his poster from the tree. &ldquo;I wanted out of your lame
	park anyway. Gah!&rdquo; Bowser stomped away directionless. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Now
	what?&rdquo; Bowser thought. For some reason he just could not get
	the tennis match out of his head. There were sports events all of
	the time, but something about this day was off. Either way, there
	was one last thing he had to do before leaving Toad Town.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	snuck around Mario&rsquo;s house with a paper in hand. On it was a
	picture of Mario and Bowser posing inside of a kart with a green x
	mark drawn over Mario. The caption said &lsquo;Friendship ended with
	Mario.&rsquo; He&rsquo;d carried that paper around in his shell
	after Iggy Koopa printed it for him for ages, and now it was time to
	deliver it. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	noticed a note on the door when he found the Mario residence.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey
	Luigi. If you come home looking for me, Yoshi and I are heading to
	Fungus Up corp to investigate. If we meet up I&rsquo;ll talk to you
	more then.<br/>
Love, Mario.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	knocked anyway, then he accidentally kicked over a can of Lichen
	Cola with Luigi&rsquo;s name on it that was sitting near the door
	like a gift. Bowser put the Lichen Cola in his shell without
	thinking. &ldquo;Well, I guess I can crash the party, then deliver
	the news! Ha! He&rsquo;ll be so disappointed to lose me as a best
	rival!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	Fungus Up corporation was a green brick building located on the
	outskirts of Toad Town with two floors, not counting the large
	factory building, and a forty foot glass replica of Fungus Up
	outside. &lsquo;Springs Up Overnight&rsquo; was spelled out by the
	yellow and green flowers in the yard. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	stepped out of the taxi and tipped the driver one coin.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sire,
	the fair was twenty coins.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Deal
	with it.&rdquo; Bowser slammed the door shut and began to walk
	towards the multi-million dollar corporation. Fungus Up was run by
	one of the wealthiest dynasties around the Mushroom Kingdom, but
	Bowser was never into their politics or economy, unless of course a
	certain pink princess came to her senses and became interested in
	him. Then he&rsquo;d care all she wanted him to, but that was
	another train of thought...</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Less than
	fifty feet away from the entrance, someone in a golf cart raced
	towards Bowser.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Can
	I help you?&rdquo; the magikoopa wearing a green polo shirt and a
	yellow sun-visor asked. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah.
	I want in this place!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">For
	a sponsorship perhaps?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Whatever.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	magikoopa smiled. &ldquo;Wonderful! Boss,&rdquo; he said into a
	radio, &ldquo;you have a special visitor. Head right in, sir!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	pushed open the glass doors to find what felt like a car dealers
	showroom. The transparent roof let in ambient light and several
	glass cases displayed the history of the company with other details
	and memorabilia inside them. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	held his nose as he walked up to an office desk. The smell of the
	place was.. kind of awful. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s in charge around
	here?!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
	hammerbro dressed in a business suit approached. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
	my special guest.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Look
	at this, freak. Can you tell me anything bout it?&rdquo; Bowser
	shoved Toad and Daisy&rsquo;s cans in the koopa&rsquo;s face. Since
	Mario wasn&rsquo;t around he might as well play detective for the
	meanwhile.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Follow
	me.&rdquo; He led Bowser into the office where there was a table and
	a few chairs. &ldquo;Take a seat. I&rsquo;m Reggie the Business bro
	by the way.&rdquo; He stuck his hand out.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	sat down and only grunted.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Reggie
	brought his hand back. &ldquo;Umm, right so these are personalized
	cans and from the date here, they were orderrrred... a few days
	ago!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">By
	who??&rdquo; Bowser said with a start.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Reggie
	turned to his computer and typed in something. &ldquo;Looks like it
	was anonymous. Customers can do so if it&rsquo;s a gift order.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	sighed. &ldquo;That was useless...&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sorry
	buddy o pal. Was this &lsquo;Toad&rsquo; and &lsquo;Daisy&rsquo; a
	fan of the switcheroo?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Huh?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Reggie
	ran his finger around the top edge of the can. &ldquo;See this seam
	here? You can now buy these new can sealer machines to reseal a can
	after cutting off the top. That&rsquo;s why legitimate tops from us
	have our symbol. See how this one is completely smooth like a
	generic?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	got a closer look. The top of the can was smooth aluminum.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Then
	they refill it with whatever and seal it like a new can. I know this
	stuff is popular around teenagers. I got five kids,&rdquo; Reggie
	added with a wink.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	crossed is arms. &ldquo;Eight. Got ya beat, buddy. Why do that
	instead of popping it open like normal and pouring whatever else
	through the top?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Because
	King Koopa sir, some establishments like schools or theaters don&rsquo;t
	allow already opened containers. If a kid comes in with what we call
	a &lsquo;switcheroo&rsquo;, only someone with Klepto like eyes will
	spot it.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The gears
	in Bowser&rsquo;s brain turned. &ldquo;Has&hellip; Mario been around
	here?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Reggie
	laughed. &ldquo;I wish. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to sponsor some more
	sports from him. Actually, I thought that was why you were here. You
	two are partners, right?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	stood up with a start. &ldquo;Whoa whoa whoa!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Business
	partners,&rdquo; Reggie added carefully. &ldquo;You two are main
	stars in the games.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Umm...&rdquo;
	Bowser had forgotten the question.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Reggie
	laughed. &ldquo;Oh never mind. We&rsquo;ll set up a Dark Land
	division soon enough.&rdquo;<br/>
He leaned back and his chair with
	his arms behind his back. &ldquo;See that over there?&rdquo; Bowser
	saw on the opposite wall a glass case with tons of awards. &ldquo;The
	Mushroom Kingdom is our oyster with our 90% market share. Do you
	know why?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Because
	you spam your garbage on every billboard?!&rdquo; Bowser turned his
	back to leave.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
	jokester, you! The secret is in our ingredients. Once you&rsquo;re
	hooked, only the soda that &lsquo;springs up overnight&rsquo; will
	do! Our manufacturing costs are extremely low also because of our
	underpaid Dinosaur Land factory workers.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser&rsquo;s
	mind briefly flashed back to a week ago when Wendy Koopa and her
	Dark Land political debate friends wouldn&rsquo;t shut up about
	something related to labor practices with the leading soda
	companies. But alas, he didn&rsquo;t care about human rights or some
	garbage. His hand grabbed the door handle and walked out.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Did
	you find your stay pleasant?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	brushed past the polo wearing magikoopa. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Someone
	requests you, sir.&rdquo; he said.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	spun back around. &ldquo;Mario?!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Uh,
	no,&rdquo; said the taxi driver. Bowser could not groan louder at
	the sight to that annoying goomba who smelt like tofu and wouldn&rsquo;t
	shut up about Glitzville wrestling during the trip over there. &ldquo;I
	really need my full fair. The bills don&rsquo;t pay themselves when
	you&rsquo;re a goomba trying to make it in a toad&rsquo;s world.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	grabbed a green looking pamphlet off of a display and scribbled on
	it.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Take
	it, idiot.&rdquo; The only reason Bowser didn&rsquo;t flame breath
	the oaf was because he wasn&rsquo;t illiterate and posters warning
	that the area was &lsquo;flammable&rsquo; were everywhere.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	goomba stared at the nutrition guide, marked &lsquo;IOU&rsquo;. &ldquo;You
	owe me what?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
	trip to the dungeon if you don&rsquo;t leave me alone!!!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That sent
	the goomba scurrying out of the door. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	magikoopa chuckled. &ldquo;Peasants are full of it, aren&rsquo;t
	they?&rdquo; he said snobbishly. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	grabbed another thick fold out pamphlet and shoved it in the
	magikoopa&rsquo;s mouth. &ldquo;And now you&rsquo;re full of that!
	Ha!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Outside
	Bowser sat on the stairs, waiting for that plumber to come around.
	Out of boredom he opened a nutrition guide to see that Fungus Up was
	full of acid as he suspected, sugar as was obvious, random chemical
	names he couldn&rsquo;t pronounce as was obligatory, and&hellip;
	koopa scale extract???</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	bent closer to the paper like the words might transform into
	something else if he stared hard enough. Bowser stormed back in to
	see no one in the showroom area. He banged on Reggie&rsquo;s office
	door.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ah,
	so you&rsquo;ve changed your mind?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
	is this??&rdquo; Bowser pointed a claw to the part of the pamphlet
	he&rsquo;d circled.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
	that! It&rsquo;s our secret ingredients that isn't really secret
	because the law requires us to put it on paper, but don&rsquo;t let
	our marketing team know that! Anyway, it&rsquo;s true. The koopas we
	get it from are from dirty foreign lands where they don&rsquo;t need
	their scales anyway. It&rsquo;s no big deal.&rdquo; Reggie produced
	a pen and paper out of nowhere. &ldquo;So, if you&rsquo;re in the
	mood. If you could just sign this contract that states that we could
	sponsor a few more Mario games-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">In a
	blind rage, Bowser flung Reggie backwards threw his office and into
	the awards case. Glass shattered everywhere. Bowser then pulled the
	fire alarm and the sirens blasted as workers began to flood the
	showroom. He ignored them and ran into an area labeled &lsquo;factory&rsquo;.
	Inside were pitiful conditions: Emaciated looking Yoshis, Rexes, and
	Dino Rhinos were slaving away, either mixing ingredients together or
	hauling heavy loads from one pallet to another. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	however was fixed on something in the back marked as &lsquo;Scales&rsquo;.
	His vision went red at the yellow tinged translucent skin patches in
	the giant container. Scorching flames shot from Bowser&rsquo;s mouth
	as he destroyed everything in his path. The dinosaur land workers
	fled as equipment caught fire and gas pipes burst. With all of the
	toxic ingredients that made up Fungus Up, not even the sprinkler
	system could put every thing out. Bowser made a dash out of the
	factory narrowly escaping a fiery explosion. The shock wave launched
	him out into the yard as the entire building shot up in flames. All
	workers except Reggie fled the scene.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">My
	beautiful business!!&rdquo; Reggie cry out in the grass. He was
	covered in little cuts.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	limped over to him. &ldquo;You are scum. Pure. Scum. Like, I&rsquo;m
	a villain and I&rsquo;m calling you out. How low can you go?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There was
	a flash in Reggie&rsquo;s eyes as he pointed accusingly. &ldquo;How
	dare you! You use slave labor yourself.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;ve
	been paying my soldiers decently for over a decade now,&rdquo;
	Bowser retorted. &ldquo;&hellip; Which I can only afford to do
	because of the high mortality rate, but whatever.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
	have no idea what you have just done.&rdquo; Reggie&rsquo;s
	different voice became low and vehement. &ldquo;If I go down,
	everything else will follow.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Enough,
	stupid! Your garbage is where it belongs. Burnt to a crisp!&rdquo;
	Bowser chuckled dryly. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Reggie
	raised his head to the sky. &ldquo;In the name of Dark Ztar I hope
	you rot in the Underwhere!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wanna
	bet on that?!&rdquo; Bowser roared.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Meanwhile
	far up in the heavens, farther than Rainbow Road, and even farther
	than Reggie&rsquo;s ego, the Great Eldstar&rsquo;s pager went off on
	a crystalline table, making a loud vibration noise.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Is
	everything fine?&rdquo; Twink peeked into a dining area of Star
	Temple.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Eldstar
	quickly hid the cookies behind his back, except there were already
	crumbs on his white moustache. &ldquo;Never mind, young one.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Twink
	shrugged. &ldquo;Oh okay!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Once the
	coast was clear, Eldstar checked the message while munching on the
	forbidden snacks. The sugar rush through his ancient veins was his
	one and only vice and well, he wasn&rsquo;t always himself while
	under its sweet enticement, but he was old and if he didn&rsquo;t
	live to the fullest he never would.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Strike
	against Bowser Y/N?- The flickering screen conveyed.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Eldstar&rsquo;s
	pager was a little&hellip; broken, and often picked up just about
	any request being sent to Star Heaven, including those not meant for
	there at all! This request was rather of an evil nature, so with a
	mildly clouded mind, Eldstar sent it through but with a twist. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><b>...Back
	on Earth:</b> </font>
	</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">CRACK!
	There was a blinding flash as lightning came down and struck Reggie.
	His entire body became black and then his particles broke down and
	flew off with the wind. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	was rendered speechless at first, but then he let out the breath
	he&rsquo;d been holding. Somehow he just felt that he&rsquo;d dodged
	a bullet bill. Or lightning cloud strike, rather. He didn&rsquo;t
	even hear or see the gang approaching until Mario wrestled him to
	the ground. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">WHAT
	DID YOU DO?!?&rdquo; Mario yelled. Yoshi came running up behind him.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	and Mario stared face to face. &ldquo;Umm, you gonna back up a bit,
	Red?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser-
	you- gosh dang!&rdquo; Yoshi exclaimed, facing the burning building.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario,
	I&rsquo;ll save you!!&rdquo; Buckenberry came running from the bus
	stop and bumped Mario off of Bowser.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Buckenberry?&rdquo;
	Mario questioned. &ldquo;I was the one on top of him. I think I was
	winning...&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Buckenberry
	let go of his hero. &ldquo;Oh&hellip; I&rsquo;m going to go into the
	background now...&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi ran

	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
	are, but whatever evidence was in there definitely isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
	Yoshi&rsquo;s palm was on his face.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No
	it ain&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Bowser dug two things out of his shell, an
	extra nutrition guide, but also Luigi&rsquo;s cola.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What&rsquo;s
	that?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	went by your house and it was there, but don&rsquo;t drink it. I
	think it&rsquo;s been resealed, see the smooth top? People can er,
	buy some kind of contraption that lets you contaminate them,&rdquo;
	Bowser explained, surprising himself by how much he&rsquo;d paid
	attention.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	picked up the Lichen Cola. &ldquo;I definitely won&rsquo;t be
	drinking this then. I hate to rush what could be a great
	conversation while standing in front of a building on fire, but Boo
	and Alagold can only hold the bus for so much longer, now what?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	turned to Luigi. &ldquo;Lichen Cola is our next clue then. Tell
	everyone that.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi and
	Yoshi sprint back to the bus stop when Mario reached out a hand to
	Bowser. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	looked at him funny. &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	smiled weakly. &ldquo;You are trying to help us, right? Why else
	would you stop at my house and then trek here on your own to
	investigate?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">To
	unfriend you officially he completed in his mind. But he just
	couldn&rsquo;t. He allowed Mario to pull him up. Immediately he felt
	the pain all over as his adrenaline began to wear off and was
	begrudgingly kind of grateful to the plumber.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario led
	him down the bus. &ldquo;Now, you know I have to ask. What the heck
	happened?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	winched in pain with every step. &ldquo;I hate this place. They use
	koopa scales and its personal.&rdquo; To his surprise, Mario didn&rsquo;t
	pry. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Okay.
	So, who custom ordered Toad and Daisy&rsquo;s cans?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It
	was anonymous so there was nothing to track.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">But
	that might not be the case elsewhere. Assuming it is resealed soda
	doing this and Luigi&rsquo;s can proves that Fungus Up wasn&rsquo;t
	the only of its kind, other companies might have clues. There&rsquo;s
	at least two other big ones in the area.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	could practically see the detective cap on the plumber. &ldquo;If
	you say so. I&rsquo;ll tag with you losers I guess.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	stopped and looked at him sincerely. &ldquo;So, does this mean
	we&rsquo;re...&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
	shared the gaze long enough to make it awkward so Bowser turned his
	head to avoid eye contact (and the fact that he felt his face
	flush). &ldquo;Sure. Whatever. Are we gonna threaten each other,
	compete, fight, and have late phone calls? Sure. Don&rsquo;t get
	sentimental on me, plumber.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	accepted whatever that was. &ldquo;Good. I&rsquo;m sorry for
	before.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Me
	too. That hospital ticked me off.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	whistled loudly from the door of the bus. &ldquo;Hurry up you two!!&rdquo;
	Just down the road, police cars and emergency service vehicles began
	to pull up.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	police, again?!&rdquo; Mario turned to Bowser. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
	scram!&hellip; Again!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Agreed,
	plumber breath. Ha!&rdquo;</font></p>

	Summary</font></p>
	<blockquote><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	T rated stuff starts, and the rest of the puzzle pieces fall..</font></blockquote>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	Mushroom Press was quiet since most writers had done their job for
	the morning papers and reporters had gone scouting out for evening
	stories. Even the desk lady was out. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So,
	yes. I can fill you in for... three tomorrow? Great. Stay pretty.&rdquo;
	Mitch hung up. He put a check mark on his bulletin board under
	&lsquo;Mushroom Fashion Week&rsquo; and leaned back in his chair to
	relax. He loved being the only person in the Press, especially when
	suffering a headache. He knew it was because of the new hire, Susie
	Que. The moment he personally met them, he knew he was in for a
	difficult time and there was nothing he could do about it.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well, he
	could, but he couldn&rsquo;t afford to expose himself. If he ignored
	the problem maybe it would go away&hellip; The doors to the press
	opened, but Mitch heard no footsteps. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey
	Mitch.&rdquo; The dark boo wearing a ratty blond wig waved from the
	door.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mitch
	swiveled his chair around. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up dude?&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	walked around Toad Town a lot,&rdquo; Susie answered in a gruff male
	voice. &ldquo;It was interesting.&rdquo; Susie went back down to
	their cubical on the opposite end and began to play computer games
	loudly. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mitch
	tried to work, but the extra noise was like rusty nails impaling his
	brain. He really wished he could expose Susie as a fake news
	reporter who really worked for Bowser and was meddling with a
	hospital, but no one would ever listen to him without proof. Proof
	he only acquired because of his special abilities that were a
	guarded secret. He hated himself sometimes. No, actually he was
	awesome in his opinion.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With a
	huff he got up to get some water, walking towards the center of the
	room to reach the fountain.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey,
	Mitch...I&rsquo;m going to quit this evening, I&rsquo;m telling you
	that because you&rsquo;re a wuss who&rsquo;s not going to rat me
	out, but I wanted to ask you something first.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
	know any others special like us? You&rsquo;re the first I&rsquo;ve
	met.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Like
	I&rsquo;d tell you,&rdquo; he replied sharply.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Susie got
	up from the chair. &ldquo;I think you will,&rdquo; they said
	menacingly. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ve met another today.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And Mitch
	was afraid to admit, it was effective. He could just explain that he
	knew very many by means to his life long secret research projects,
	but his ego said-</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He went
	back to his desk and sat down. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, you
	lonely, pathetic, unwanted, freak. Or should I call you by your real
	name? Zoo Diddley!!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Instantly
	Mitch regretted that. A sharp surge of pain and pressure behind his
	eye and he blacked out for a moment. The next thing he remembered
	was laying on the office floor in a small pool of some kind of warm
	liquid. His vision was blurry and his chair was turned over. Mitch&rsquo;s
	own hands came into focus and on them was blood, the source being
	from his nose. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
	little brat,&rdquo; Mitch muttered, shivering uncontrollably. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Shut
	up!&rdquo; Zoo rushed over and punched him in the gut. &ldquo;Say
	that again and I&rsquo;ll make you cough up your own freaking lung!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Okay
	okay, I know a few&hellip; Uh, Jelectro Bond! He came by earlier!&rdquo;
	Mitch blurted out, his normal baritone reduced to something of a
	squeak. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a vacationer in the area or something.. or
	he could have been a spy. We didn&rsquo;t really talk.. or share&hellip;
	much.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	leaned in close. &ldquo;Was that so difficult?!&rdquo; He shoved the
	small Toad into the wall of the cubicle, making papers and other
	possessions of Mitch&rsquo;s fall to the ground. &ldquo;Now, screw
	off you wuss! Tell Steve I&rsquo;m leaving.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo left
	out the doors in a hurry, leaving Mitch bruised physically and
	mentally. He eventually got up to clean himself up, straighten out
	his work space, and hop back on his computer, eager to get back at
	the boo somehow, in a non-confrontational way of course. Using his
	rusty reporting skills, he recounted everything he knew...</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A red
	haired human, the front desk lady, the entered Mushroom Press and
	sat some things down at her station. She had scented candles for
	Steve the bullet bill anchor man and boss, wall art for Betty who
	worked in the back press, and some stationary for Mitch. When she
	headed to Mitch&rsquo;s cubicle she froze at the sight of the brown
	stain on the carpet that looked like it had been recently cleaned. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Mr.
	Toadstool?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mitch's
	chair slid back out of the U shaped cubicle. &quot;Jesse, babe. Uh
	what are you doing back so early?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	stared him up and down, (and not for the usual reasons she did so).
	His overcoat was missing, there were a few stains on his shirt, and
	he had tissue up his nose. &quot;Did something happen here?!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I'm
	fine, babe. Just spilled some coffee. You can leave the flower
	stationery on my file cabinet.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The lady
	nodded and walked away briskly. Mitch hoped Jesse was too distracted
	to realize that she'd never mentioned the stationery or even her
	name to him before. </font>
	</p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Few
	people knew that Doctor Toadley was an expert at landmines, unless
	of course they read the tagline on his website, but no one ever did,
	so it always came as a surprise that he could flag and detect an
	entire field of the bombs in a minute, even while distracted by
	noisy patients, Birdley, and Mary the intern&rsquo;s loud radio
	music. The only thing stopping him from going pro was his 99%
	success rate.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Nooo!&rdquo;
	Toadley belted at his laptop when a mine blew up, shattering that
	100 game winning streak on the computer game called Minesweeper.
	Toad and Daisy were still lying on their cots unconscious with
	restraints holding him down. A testing computer went off behind the
	doctor and as he got up to check on it the doors to the lab swung
	open. Dr. Toadley shield his eyes from the natural light that flood
	in. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
	is wrong?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
	have a visitor,&rdquo; Mary explained in a fearful low tone. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">In the
	lobby Zoo put down &lsquo;Death Machine Magazine&rsquo; he was
	reading. &ldquo;You only deal with special cases, right?&rdquo; The
	wig was long shed as he was now himself.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	do. Must I also ask you to leave? Yes! This clinic is appointment
	only.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo threw
	the magazine down. &ldquo;No one told me that.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadley
	nodded his head. &ldquo;Is such life? Indeed.&rdquo; Meanwhile Mary
	hid behind her desk.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	think you need to see him,&rdquo; she squeaked.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah,
	you&rsquo;d better,&rdquo; Zoo threatened, baring sharp teeth with
	one or two missing. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m
	capable of, doc.&rdquo; Zoo lifted an arm out and waited for a
	second, then had a blank look.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	purple clad doctor remained unaffected. &ldquo;Did I not ask you to
	leave, hooligan? Yes I did.&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Birdley
	came out of nowhere to swoop down at Zoo&rsquo;s face, pecking him
	all the way out of the door leading out. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mary
	began to read her book as if nothing happened when the doctor
	stepped before her desk with his thick eyebrows turned downward.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Should
	you inform patients of my clinic&rsquo;s rules BEFORE bringing them
	to me? Yes you should.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mary
	rolled her eyes. &ldquo;Well, he seemed like a thug.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Are
	there any thugs in Toad Town? No there are not! Now I need no
	interruptions.&rdquo; Dr. Toadley retreat into the lab.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mary went
	back to the literature. &ldquo;Gosh, excuse me then. You can never
	be too sure...&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Meanwhile
	at the Shroom Grocery in Toad Town, a middle aged green capped toad
	dusted off the item shelves to make room for spring mushrooms,
	boomerang flowers, and double cherries to give him an edge over
	Harry&rsquo;s shop down south and Koopa&rsquo;s Shop to the East. It
	could even cut into Rowf and Rhuff&rsquo;s badge shop profit, but he
	wouldn&rsquo;t push too aggressively with that, not after that very
	unfortunate meet up they had in a back alley once..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The shop
	keeper turned around when a Toad teenager holding a spear came in.
	&ldquo;Thomas, glad you&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	am too, uncle.&rdquo; Thomas, the shop keeper&rsquo;s nephew and
	apprentice when not guarding Peach&rsquo;s castle on first shift,
	gave the displays a glance. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;m
	going to clean the windows outside. Run the desk for me.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thomas
	nodded and stood behind the counter, tapping his fingers on it.
	After a while, he was startled by the door being kicked open. In
	came a young human female with tanned skin, long brown hair, and a
	yellow and orange dress. Behind her was a bob-omb buddy with a
	blonde colored buzz cut.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">HI
	I&rsquo;M DAFFODIL!&rdquo; Daffodil shouted in the style of Daisy. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A Boss
	Bass wearing an eye patch propped open the door with a rock. &ldquo;Aye,
	hush it, mouth breather!&rdquo; the boss bass barked at someone
	outside before stepping in.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thomas
	subconsciously reached in vain for the panic button before
	remembering that he wasn&rsquo;t at the castle. &ldquo;Who are
	you?!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daffodil
	leaned on the counter. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t ya hear? It&rsquo;s
	Daffodil Loon, professional baddie and Princess Daisy impersonator.
	This is Chomper, and this is Nukem!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	bob-omb hopped on the counter. &ldquo;Born to be wiiiiiild!&rdquo;
	he said in an extremely cool voice. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Aye,
	enough of them quotes!&rdquo; Chomper said, pointing a very huge
	fish hook to Thomas&rsquo;s back. It made Thomas&rsquo;s spear that
	was laying around in the corner look like a toothpick in comparison.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
	have to make a good first impression,&rdquo; Nukem explained in a
	slightly less cool voice.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Corny,
	just like a DAD.&rdquo; Chomper sigh in annoyance.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well
	at least my wife doesn&rsquo;t complain that I smell like fish-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daffodil
	broke open one of the display cases with a baseball bat. Everyone
	shut up.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	smirked. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s better. Now, a little birdy told us
	that there's about to be some action in Toad Town and we want the
	first slice of that pie, starting with West Toad Town, our homeland!
	Ain&rsquo;t that right?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thomas&rsquo;s
	teeth clacked. &ldquo;W-what are you talking about??&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	means the Toad Town message boards, young man.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Chomper
	glared at the pink bob-bomb. &ldquo;Stop being so nice already!
	Ahhhg!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Knock
	it off ya&rsquo;ll!&rdquo; Daffodil fussed. &ldquo;Now, we&rsquo;ll
	give ya ten seconds to hand over the shop keys and scram!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thomas
	tossed the keys to Daffodil who caught them in the air stylishly but
	the young toad was still too scared to move. Nukem scurried over the
	Thomas with his little bob-omb feet.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Could
	you please leave? Or else I&rsquo;ll skin you and turn you into a
	life sized toad plush for my kids to play with.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thomas
	screamed like a little girl and ran out of the shop. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Nukem
	turned to his cohorts knowingly. &ldquo;See? Being polite always
	works out.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Outside
	Thomas tripped over his uncle who had a bruise on his forehead as he
	sat slumped against the wall. Down the street, groups of assorted
	people marched holding signs with Fungus Up on them among other
	civil unrest, but Thomas ignored that. If he didn&rsquo;t get his
	uncle checked on, he might have to work for Peach forever!</font></p>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Club
	Gamecube was a restaurant that opened as a direct competitor to Club
	64, only catering to younger hipper socialites with a dining area, a
	bar, and a stage for performers, all modern looking with lots of
	stainless steel and dim &lsquo;edgy&rsquo; lighting of orange,
	purple, and blue hues. It was also jam packed.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The

	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So
	we go to Club 64 then, right?&rdquo; Richard asked, already half way
	out the door.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	manager spun around. &ldquo;NOOO DON&rsquo;T! Maybe we can do
	something.&rdquo; He clapped with some invisible hands and the
	waiter was again at the front of the restaurant waiting area, now
	with even more food tossed at him.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Make
	some room,&rdquo; the talking console barked. &ldquo;Get some people
	that look like they&rsquo;re done eating and kick them out.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Morris
	rubbed his hand together maliciously. Just a moment later, a family
	of Kongs, Donkey Kong, Diddly Kong, Tiny Kong, Dixie Kong, and Funky
	Kong were being escorted out by the cooks with confused looks upon
	their visages.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ugh,
	just great...&rdquo; Richard groaned as his fellow agents followed
	the waiter to their seats at a round table right near the stage.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Back at
	the front of the restaurant, another person walked in, a dark boo.
	The manager sized them up instantly: they were thuggish which meant
	they were probably broke, which meant that the lower prices of Club
	64, his worst rival, across the street might be right up their alley
	if he didn&rsquo;t accompany them.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	have a seat for you!&rdquo; the manager said preemptively. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo eyed
	him curiously. &ldquo;I was just here to perform. It&rsquo;s open
	mic Friday, right?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	manager lost some of that feigned zeal. &ldquo;Oh&hellip; Just in
	time. This early in the day we let the z-list comedians clown on
	stage.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Funny
	you&rsquo;d mention that.&rdquo; Zoo chuckled, thinking about being
	called a &lsquo;Z-list&rsquo;.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-And
	so years ago, they were talkin&rsquo; about making a booster shot
	for the Mushroom Flu, but that didn&rsquo;t fall through,&rdquo;
	Parabilly said with his menu folded flat.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There
	have only been 2,000 confirmed cases in the past anyway. Despite its
	infamy it is indeed a rare affliction, and reluctance to spend
	exorbitant amounts of money and time is not entirely unreasonable,&rdquo;
	Wiggs added.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Club
	64 is soooo much better.&rdquo; Richard&rsquo;s menu lay untouched
	before him and he could swear heard someone loading a sniper rifle
	in the background..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">James sat
	his menu down. &ldquo;I know what I want now. Where&rsquo;s the
	waiter?&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yes,
	my fellows?&rdquo; Morris came up and stood at the table. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There
	you are, gimme&hellip;&rdquo; James squinted at the menu again and
	it became obvious he couldn&rsquo;t read any of the fine print.
	Everyone groaned. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Just
	give us all water.&rdquo; Parabilly sighed. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Morris
	jotted it down then adjusted his glasses. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t
	mind me asking, are you a group of doctors? I noticed your badges..&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sebastian
	nodded. &ldquo;Yeah, why?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">This
	restaurant is my part time job when I&rsquo;m not a scientist at the
	&lsquo;International Medical University of-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Then
	someone tapped Morris on the shoulders. &ldquo;Your boss said to
	show me the backstage, if you&rsquo;d be so kind.&rdquo; Zoo&rsquo;s
	dry tone belied the politeness of his words, but Morris didn&rsquo;t
	care. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	brought Zoo behind the stage. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name and what
	kind of comedian are you? My buddies on my second job could use a
	laugh.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	grinned, revealing those teeth again. &ldquo;Call me...&rsquo;Z&rsquo;,
	and I do situational comedy I guess, hehe. I also specialize in
	audience participation.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Never
	heard of you.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Probably
	because I don&rsquo;t use Twatter, Facenote, or Stumblr.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Is
	that a computer thing? I do not blame you,&rdquo; Morris said, put
	off.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	peeked out of the curtains to see a full house. This day wasn&rsquo;t
	honestly that bad even if he felt lousy, since he&rsquo;d had free
	reign to do whatever in Toad Town since this morning. He was bummed
	the one doctor who might have been able to help didn&rsquo;t and Zoo
	couldn&rsquo;t even use his talents to &lsquo;persuade&rsquo; him to
	do so. Antics at occurred afterward made up for it: Zoo used his
	encyclopedic knowledge of Toad Town to get from the East side where
	Dr. Toadley&rsquo;s office was to the West with ease, even with the
	random angry protesters shouting some nonsense about soda. One guy
	tried to mug Zoo on the sidewalk, but Zoo grabbed a random wooden
	plank and bashed his head in, mugging the mugger and gaining almost
	enough for a taxi fare. Almost. So the goomba taxi driver started a
	fuss when Zoo was a few coins short, even mentioning that someone
	had just shortchanged him before. Zoo made up for the rest by making
	the goomba&rsquo;s eyes spontaneously bleed and grabbing his necktie
	from the back, strangling him&hellip; among other things. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Speaking
	of which, there was still a little blood on the back of the tie Zoo
	was currently borrowing from the guy, but it wasn&rsquo;t really
	visible from the front, so good enough. Zoo did enjoy being on stage
	and performing so he had to look a little presentable.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Back in
	the dining area, James dramatically laid his menu flat on the table
	again. &ldquo;Okay, I want the number five special with some
	Chuckola Cola on the side!&rdquo; Then the lights began to dim.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jimmy,
	look! A show is starting!!&rdquo; Sebastian started pointing on
	stage.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	still think Club 64 is better.&rdquo; Suddenly, a bullet went
	through Richard&rsquo;s glass of water and shattered it everywhere.
	Richard watched his back from then on. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	curtains opened and a spotlight was shown on Zoo. He floated up to
	the mic awkwardly. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">HEY
	ladies, and gentlemen, and freaks! Call me &lsquo;Z&rsquo;. To
	start, here&rsquo;s something that cracks all the Bowser soldiers
	up. There was a bob-omb, a koopa, and a goomba, all soldiers of
	Bowser on lunch break. So the bob-omb asks the goomba, &lsquo;What
	did you do today?&rsquo;. The goomba says &lsquo;I was stationed
	between two pipes&rsquo; and the bomb is like &lsquo;You&rsquo;re
	lying and you&rsquo;ve been slacking off all day&rsquo; and the
	goomba is like &lsquo;How do you know?&rsquo; and the bomb says
	&lsquo;Because you&rsquo;d be stuck there forever. Goombas don&rsquo;t
	jump!&rsquo;.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
	earned some subdued laughter from a few, including Sebastian and
	Parabilly.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Shut
	up,&rdquo; Richard growled. He then ducked under the table to be
	safe.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-But
	the goomba asks the bob-omb &lsquo;What did YOU do then?&rsquo; and
	the bomb is like &lsquo;Well I fought Mario today&rsquo; and the
	goomba is like &lsquo;You&rsquo;re lying too because you&rsquo;re
	supposed to blow yourself up if you fight so you must have slacked
	off too!&rsquo;&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">This
	earned even more laughter, except from the living bombs in the
	audience, who began to sizzle threateningly.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	continued. &ldquo;-And the koopa started walking off and they both
	asked him &lsquo;Where are you going?&rsquo; and he was like &lsquo;To
	King Bowser&rsquo; and they were like &lsquo;Why&rsquo; and he was
	like &lsquo;To report you both for not working!&rsquo;&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Some of
	the audience clapped, thinking the joke was over.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-And
	so the bob-omb and the goomba were both sent to the dungeons where
	they worked hard labor until they died. Their families got the full
	compensation&hellip; of about five dollars. The end,&rdquo; Zoo
	concluded in complete deadpan.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Morris,
	who was hanging around near the kitchen was the only one laughing
	then.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Now
	that we&rsquo;re all warmed up, for the next part of my act could I
	have some volunteers?&rdquo; Zoo asked.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	entire restaurant got quiet.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You.&rdquo;
	Zoo pointed to Parabilly. &ldquo;Come on down, hehe!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Parabilly
	looked around. &ldquo;Me?! Well, I reckon I could stretch my legs.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Okay
	so this is a game called &lsquo;Peek-a-boo&rsquo; where I guess
	stuff about you. Hmm..&rdquo; Zoo eyed the Paratroopa up and down
	for a moment then sniffed him suddenly. He faced the mic. &ldquo;That's
	his grandma's perfume.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Parabilly's
	face went red. &ldquo;I don't wear no dern perfume!!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Right&hellip;
	that probably rubbed off when she hugged you tightly and gave you
	that kiss on the cheek yesterday.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">James
	stood in his seat in protest. &ldquo;It was your turn to wash the
	truck and youse said you'd be on your second job all day!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	was! She visits me there, now shut up! Ain&rsquo;t no shame in
	that!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Right,&rdquo;
	Zoo said perspicaciously. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not as embarrassing as
	what happened with your sister in law.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Parabilly
	whipped towards the dark boo, arms crossed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re out
	of your dern mind you lil vermin! That time I walked up to the bride
	after the wedding and in a quick lil&rsquo; jest pretended to be my
	brother Probabilly. She believed it and kissed me all a sudden. Then
	Probabilly came round the corner, but he couldn&rsquo;t decide which
	eye to punch me in so he did both, the rough housing little-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">One whomp
	at a table laughed so hard spaghetti ran from his nose. Most of the
	other tables were laughing also. The red faced paratroopa ran off
	stage to a round of applause and didn&rsquo;t return to his seat.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Never
	mind him, that&rsquo;s what he gets for making us wash the car,&rdquo;
	Richard said dismissively. &ldquo;I mean, that drive-thru car wash
	took 64 of my own hard earned coins-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">An other
	bullet clashed against their table, this time shooting a hole in
	Wiggletron&rsquo;s appetizer and destroying the food. The tall
	wiggler shrugged. &ldquo;I suppose that is what I get for ordering a
	meal off screen,&rdquo; he said dryly. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You!&rdquo;
	Zoo pointed to Sebastian next.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Awesome!&rdquo;
	Sebastian climb on stage any quicker as he rushed to the mic.
	&ldquo;Hiiii!&rdquo; He waved. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Sebastian Bullet
	from Subcon.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Uh,
	okay..&rdquo; Zoo stared for one moment before leaning in. &ldquo;So
	tell us about that cool dream you had last night.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sebastian
	gaped behind his mask. &ldquo;But- which one? I sleep all of the
	time, including behind the wheel!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">BOOO!&rdquo;
	went some of the audience, including Morris in the background.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sebastian
	dismissed his haters. &ldquo;Fine, here&rsquo;s a really really good
	one. I think I wanted to forget about it, but I really can&rsquo;t&hellip;
	So I had a dream that Peach invited me to her castle and she baked
	and entire cake for me. Then the bundt cake came alive and chased us
	around so she told me we could hide in her bedroom, yeah, and-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Everyone
	were on the edge of their seats.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sebastian
	continued innocently, &ldquo;-When we got in there we were suddenly
	in outer space and I looked at Peach and she had turned into Shigeru
	Miyamoto wearing a tutu. He said I was the best gamer ever and a
	nice guy and so I won unlimited video-games for life&hellip; Then I
	woke up and wet the bed...&rdquo; Sebastian slapped his snifit mask.
	&ldquo;Oh, right! That&rsquo;s why I wanted to forget, because the
	bed I wet was actually the new couch Jimmy just put in our work
	trailer!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Among the
	loud cheering from the packed audience, James was screaming his head
	off. &ldquo;GET OFF STAGE!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sebastian
	grabbed the mic one more time. &ldquo;Okay that was it! Byyyyyeee!&rdquo;
	He hopped off stage, noticed James looked like a nuclear bomb about
	to go off, and instead decided that it might be better to join
	Parabilly outside.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Now,
	why don&rsquo;t you come up?&rdquo; Zoo asked the enraged monty
	mole.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">James
	climbed up immediately. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ask
	him where he got that hair cut!&rdquo; Richard called up mockingly.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	has a notable absence of hair, Richard,&rdquo; Wiggletron replied,
	again not realizing he was being insulting.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">James
	pointed to them both. &ldquo;Something something Club 64! Whack em!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Instead
	of targeting the mega goomba or wiggler at the table, a sniper
	bullet shot the fedora straight off of Jame&rsquo;s head, revealing
	the round furless dome. He covered it with his hands as the audience
	roared. A yoshi in the crowd got excited and swallowed their entire
	plate whole. A toad threw flowers on stage. Still others were
	banging fists on tables, wanting more drama.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	loosed the bow tie around his neck, sweating from the pressure.
	&ldquo;Umm, let&rsquo;s see here... when was your first bank
	robbery?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">James
	suddenly felt like he&rsquo;d need his inhaler but hid it under a
	mask of &lsquo;wiseguy&rsquo;. &ldquo;Youse trying to give me the
	shake down, and it ain&rsquo;t gonna work! My family is the feared
	Monty Mafia of Donut Plains and erm- You didn&rsquo;t just hear
	nothing, see?&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	audience clapped very softly as James stumbled off stage and out the
	door, covering his head the entire time. No one dare laugh directly
	at him though.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	want the goomba up here next.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Richard
	jumped on stage. &ldquo;Yo.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Why&rsquo;d
	you run from home?&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Richard
	snorted. &ldquo;You got another thing coming if you think I&rsquo;m
	going to explain why I left Giant Land. Oh snap...I said it.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Okay,
	never mind. What&rsquo;s your most pleasant memory?&rdquo; Zoo asked
	with a change of tone.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">When
	my momma used to tuck me in at night and read stories and-&rdquo;
	Richard abruptly stopped and scowled. &ldquo;You idiot, you got me
	again. Now what&rsquo;s your favorite restaurant?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
	don&rsquo;t ask me stuff!&rdquo; Zoo replied petulantly. &ldquo;But
	I don&rsquo;t know really. Bowser&rsquo;s Castle food is pretty much
	designed to make you constipated, because I guess his medieval age
	sewer systems can&rsquo;t handle what would happen if the five
	hundred employees and two thousand soldiers crapped regularly. I&rsquo;m
	gonna say its the peanut butter and toe jam sandwiches if we&rsquo;re
	talking local, but a nice Shroom Fry if we mean from the city, like
	you can get at Club 64.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Excuse
	me, what?&rdquo; Richard pretended to not catch it.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Club
	64!&rdquo; Zoo repeated louder.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Richard
	grinned as he waited for it, but nothing happened. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
	out of here, shortie.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	moment he stepped off stage, a barrage of bullets started flying
	everywhere, directed at his feet. While the mega goomba rushed out
	of the restaurant to avoid getting hit, everyone clapped like that
	was part of the show, even though bullets were riddled everywhere,
	hit a few bystanders, and the area smelt like smoke.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ahhhh!
	What was-a that?!&rdquo; shriek a scared cook in the back.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	manager hid the semiautomatic behind his cube shaped back. &ldquo;Nothing.
	Just a stage effect.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">This
	is so freaking cool,&rdquo; Zoo thought out loud back on stage. &ldquo;I
	mean, uh. Last one. Come on up!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wiggletron
	shot up from the table. &ldquo;That is enough! You will end this
	debased comedic act now!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	was calling you.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	bespectacled wiggler smiled. &ldquo;Oh, I am absolutely honored. No
	one ever calls me for anything!&rdquo; He got on stage next to Zoo.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Just
	say whatever you want to say. I have a good feeling about you.&rdquo;
	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wiggs was
	almost giddy at the suggestion. &ldquo;I have one set of parents,
	two brothers, and one sister. Do you know the probability of that is
	1/69? I am however the only medical practitioner in my family, at
	least of a certified variety.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	nodded along. No one really laughed, so it was time to step it up.
	&ldquo;How did you lose your driver&rsquo;s license?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	do not have one in my possession any longer because when I was in
	college I braked too hard for a tanooki in the street once, and
	consequently caused a ten vehicle pileup,&rdquo; he explained with
	machine like disinterest. &ldquo;But that story is not nearly as
	riveting as the moment when a friend of mine T. Yoshisaur, showed me
	the world of &lsquo;vaxing&rsquo; and how its effectiveness against
	Birdo flu, Goombola, koopatitis or toadpox are subjective at best-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wiggs was
	cut off by the audience thinking he was joking.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hold
	it down guys!&rdquo; Zoo said, cracking up. &ldquo;Last, who do you
	have a crush on?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">YOU
	CANNOT MAKE ME REVEAL SUCH INFORMATION!&rdquo; Wiggs completely
	blindsided Zoo by knocking his purple spherical body backward and
	all the way through the curtains.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Now Zoo
	was kind of annoyed. He burst through ready to retaliate when his
	attention was brought to two things: Patrons went wild at their
	seats, laughing, hooting, and hollering at the show. The employees
	but mostly Morris, struggled to keep up with the commotion and the
	constant request for Chuckola Cola. This was perfect. This was what

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Chapter
	Summary</font></p>
	<blockquote><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Now
	back to our regularly scheduled heroes and villains!</font></blockquote>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	Lichen Cola company was located in Fahr Outpost&rsquo;s industrial
	park. The sky was grey, the temperature chilly, and black smog
	linger low to the ground. The long straight street, lined to the
	sides by powdery snow covered shrubs, lead towards the ugly reality
	of the urban utopia most Mushroom Kingdom denizens thought little
	about. Hidden this world remained to most except the seven that
	infiltrated it's secrets, arriving by means of the most rarely used
	bus stop.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi,
	Boo, and Yoshi took the lead towards their destination. The Toads
	were a few steps behind, and Mario and Bowser were even farther, the
	plumber choosing to stay with the limping koopa king and advising
	them to run ahead.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">During
	the walk, Buckenberry held Alagold&rsquo;s phone while Gold took his
	medication..</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hello.
	10/10.&rdquo; Buckenberry said on someone's Facenote profile while
	logged in as Alagold still.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">u
	r cte 2,&rdquo; the toad girl who was a instaham model also replied.
	Her profile photo was dolled up with filters enhancing her
	voluptuous body, wearing only a long white shirt with 'Hungry for
	1-Ups&rsquo; print on it.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thanks.
	I'm Buckenberry T. by the way, and I would love to court you.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Not
	wasting a second: &ldquo;ew!!111! I thght u wre tht cuti Gold. go
	awy lsr.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His pink
	tinged hands shook the phone violently as he boiled over. What did
	the dusty yellow toad beside him who was half daydreaming half
	stumbling along with that noise spray thing up his nose have that
	Buckenberry didn't?</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Knock
	that off,&rdquo; Alagold whispered, turning his head to see his
	friend freaking out.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	spun around with suspicion. &ldquo;What's going on back there?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Alagold
	hid his medication in his back pocket. &ldquo;I have allergies,
	bro.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Narrowing
	his eyes, Yoshi faced ahead again. &ldquo;Can someone check what&rsquo;s
	going on in Toad Town? It might help to know if we were spotted at
	the crime scene.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	nodded. &ldquo;Good idea!&hellip; Is what I would say if I had a
	signal.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;ll
	look it up, hehe.&rdquo; Boo started searching Toad Town online
	message boards again. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all over the Fungus Up
	incident but they can't really blame anyone&hellip; Also some gangs
	are starting in Toad Town.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	dismissed that with a wave of the hand. &ldquo;That last part is
	probably fake news. There&rsquo;s never been gangs in Toad Town, and
	I&rsquo;m as old as a... dinosaur,&rdquo; he said with his mind
	becoming preoccupied with something else. &ldquo;..It&rsquo;s nice
	Mario and I met you guys on the same bus. You with the phone, what&rsquo;s
	your name again?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo.
	Just Boo. I&rsquo;m twenty five and umm, I just work at a fast food
	joint and on a rare occasion show up in a Mario spin off game. It's
	kind of lonely.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi put
	an arm around Boo. &ldquo;No shame in that.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Buckenberry
	quickened his pace to catch up with his arms crossed. &ldquo;I
	disagree&hellip; Frig!&rdquo; he shout all of a sudden.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Soon they
	reached a three stories tall building made of rusty metal sheets
	welded together with a few large cloudy windows, adorned with a
	sloppy &lsquo;LICHEN COLA Co. WINTRY ACIDY TASTE&rsquo; in white
	paint on the top. It took no liberties to look like or be anything
	but it was: An old stinky factory that made millions off of dumping
	calories and caffeine into unknowing or uncaring patrons. Luigi and
	crew caught a glance through the imposing but graciously open
	barbwire fence of a few workers who looked like handpicked weirdos
	for a movie hauling plastic cases to storage units.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">This
	place is tripping, bro!&rdquo; Alagold slurred, actually seeing a
	clean Willy Wonky style factory with rainbows in the skies and pink
	cotton candy clouds.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	held his nose.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Good
	thing the gates are open. Think they&rsquo;d spare a free sample?&rdquo;
	Luigi wondered out loud.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">My
	mom doesn&rsquo;t allow me soda...&rdquo; Boo admitted silently.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Buckenberry
	knocked very hard against the wooden door that hung on one hinge.
	They stood around for a while, starting to shiver from the cold
	until the door swung open to reveal a lakitu in brown work uniform
	riding a tan cloud.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
	do you want!?&rdquo; he barked in a Brooklyn accent.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hi.
	We just had some questions or.. should we wait for Mario?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lakitu&rsquo;s
	shifted eyes darted around. &ldquo;Mario&rsquo;s around? Listen, we
	don&rsquo;t want no trouble and we&rsquo;ve paid that land tax so if
	the Princess is trying to be funny, tell her to screw off.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Erm&hellip;
	We&rsquo;re not here for that. We just want to know if anyone&rsquo;s
	been ordering personalized cans and doing some kind of weird thing
	to them also.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	lakitu scratched his head. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Resealing
	the cans, bro. There&rsquo;s this thing on Fleabay that molds sheets
	of aluminum into circles that you can clamp on to cans of soda after
	you&rsquo;ve refilled it,&rdquo; Alagold explained.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
	talk like you knew all about that,&rdquo; Yoshi said.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Alagold
	smiled in a ditzy manner. &ldquo;I did. Just&hellip; it never came
	up until what happened today.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh,
	yeah. Here.&rdquo; Luigi showed the can with his name on it with
	it&rsquo;s smooth top.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well,
	it is lacking the seal we put on the tops,&rdquo; the lakitu said.
	&ldquo;As far as tracking who ordered this one? Our computer crashed
	the other day. Unless you have proof that we can be sued for this
	sort of thing, see ya.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He then
	slammed the door in their faces.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	spun around to face the others, not particularly pleased, but not
	upset either. &ldquo;You know what this means. We-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wait
	for Mario to catch up,&rdquo; Yoshi said.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi&rsquo;s
	words died on his tongue. &ldquo;...No. I thought maybe we could..
	look and find clues.. and&hellip; It&rsquo;s my time to shine,
	please, listen to me!&rdquo; he plead.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;m
	all for that, Luigi bro! This place looks cool!&rdquo; Alagold stood
	on tiptoes to see through a window inside the building, observing
	wonders inside that probably didn&rsquo;t exist.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	sighed, not bothering to hide agedness. &ldquo;Okay, we can look
	around. Just&hellip; I&rsquo;m watching your toad friends.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario and
	Bowser were still on the path that went through the industrial park
	when Bowser stubbed his toe on another large rock. &ldquo;Oww!&rdquo;
	he growled.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Are
	you alright?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">OF
	COURSE NOT. My feet, legs, back, arms, head, shoulders, knees, toes,
	and everything else aches right now. Gotta mushroom, fuzz face?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No,
	but you&rsquo;ll live&hellip;&rdquo; After a seconds pause, Mario
	laughed. &ldquo;It sure is a good thing I do the traveling to you in
	our games. We&rsquo;d still be in the first &lsquo;Super Mario Bros&rsquo;
	at your pace.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser&rsquo;s
	right arm shot out to give him a jab, sending him off into the icy
	ground. Mario got up and wiped the dirt off himself. &ldquo;Geez!
	Sorry.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	growled in response and Mario didn&rsquo;t tempt him farther, except
	for a question he&rsquo;d been thinking of during the whole bus
	trip.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser,
	I know this is a sensitive topic, but I have to ask-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	turned his head. &ldquo;Plumber, what?!?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	smiled. &ldquo;&hellip; Have you ever been arrested before? I don&rsquo;t
	mean me going after you like a cowboy cop, I mean like the whole
	staying overnight on a wooden bench while the guy next to you smells
	like old socks and burritos and your brother won&rsquo;t be able to
	pay your bail for another two days because your last plumbing job
	was for a broke family of seven on the twelfth floor of an apartment
	complex in Brooklyn and they won&rsquo;t earn their check until
	Wednesday.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	scratched his chin. &ldquo;Hmm. Yeah actually except I was the
	brother in that situation kinda. Ugh&hellip; I&rsquo;m getting
	angry, well MORE angry thinking &lsquo;bout it, but Clawdia got in
	the slammer for theft like usual against the Jewelry Kingdom and I
	had to get her out. Invading the kingdom wasn&rsquo;t an option, we
	were just developing our airships then. It was before everything
	really, my kids, part of my castle was still under construction, I
	didn&rsquo;t pay my soldiers... Wow, that sent me back!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Uh,
	wait.&rdquo; Mario nudged him lightly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not
	Clawdia&rsquo;s brother are you???&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No
	no no no no! That was just the example! Like how Green is always
	fixing your screw ups,&rdquo; Bowser said with a hint of mockery in
	his tone.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	rolled his eyes. &ldquo;Luigi doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He rubbed his
	arms together with the cold wind.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Nah,
	he&rsquo;s just really good at it and you don&rsquo;t notice, pipes
	for brains. Anyway, that sort of thing ended when Clawdia left me
	for a richer koopa in Diamond City.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Aww&hellip;&rdquo;
	Mario found himself caring in a weird way. &ldquo;Do you miss her?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	stared straight ahead, avoiding eye contact. They weren&rsquo;t far
	from the company. &ldquo;Mr. Good Guy, of course I don&rsquo;t miss
	the trips to the slammer, her embarrassing me constantly, that awful
	perfume, and her ear grating voice. That all happened before I met
	you, so now I&rsquo;m not lonely- Er, wait, that didn&rsquo;t come
	out right. I mean, you fill that void- no, still wrong...&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario was
	flattered, maybe more than he should have been, but he didn&rsquo;t
	know what to say. He was saved from the awkwardness by the fact that
	they&rsquo;d reach the gate. He didn&rsquo;t see the rest of the
	group anywhere so he made way for the door.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Soon the
	same lakitu swung it open. &ldquo;Now what do you clowns want?!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Answer
	our questions or you&rsquo;re gonna get it like Fungus Up did!&rdquo;
	Bowser roared while grabbing the lakitu&rsquo;s collar. &ldquo;&hellip;
	Not that you can prove we did anything if you&rsquo;re thinkin about
	reporting us or something.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lakitu
	gasped. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the reason Fungus Up went down today!?
	I&rsquo;m not calling the cops over that!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You&rsquo;re
	not?&rdquo; Mario replied.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No!
	I am wetting myself though!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	shoved him back with some disgust.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Can
	we start over? We need to investigate stuff.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	lakitu shook Mario&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Mi casa es su casa. We were
	waiting for FungusUp to go down with that huge market share and the
	one million industry violations. The name&rsquo;s Jos&eacute; by the
	way.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi,
	Yoshi, Alagold and Buckenberry had their backs to the wall on the
	side of the factory. Around the corner came two shirts and two hats
	floating along as something invisible carried them.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	knew you&rsquo;d pull through. Way to go!&rdquo; Luigi cheered on.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thanks.&rdquo;
	Boo became visible again. &ldquo;They were lying around in some open
	lockers, so I took what I could.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	made a face as he examined the stains in the shirts. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
	the plan again?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
	wear these and sneak in.&rdquo; Luigi slipped a shirt over his usual
	clothes.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Is
	that necessary? Those workers over there have been looking right at
	us the entire time.&rdquo; Yoshi pointed out the workers a distance
	away hauling the crates to and fro from a store house to a truck. A
	few would eye them with one or more eyes (number varied) and then
	shrug it off with the Latin music playing from a radio in the
	background drowning out whatever they might have been muttering.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">But
	it&rsquo;s cooler this way! We have to find the clues somehow.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	want to search for clues in the chocolate river, bro.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	looked at Alagold funny. &ldquo;What? Why don&rsquo;t you stay
	outside. The way you&rsquo;re swaying left and right, you&rsquo;re
	liable to fall into some heavy machinery... And die.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo shook
	in fright. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go in anymore!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi!&rdquo;
	Luigi reprimanded.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Us
	three can stay outside,&rdquo; Buckenberry said. &ldquo;Too many of
	us would probably be suspicious anyway.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
	actually sounds smart, I&rsquo;m cool with that.&rdquo; Yoshi held
	his breath as he put on the shirt. &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s do it
	Luigi.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	picked up a crate. &ldquo;Help me hold this.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Once they
	were gone, Buckenberry quickly turned towards where the workers
	were, noticing the heavy items they lifted. He touched Alagold on
	the shoulder. &ldquo;Hey. Could you take pictures of me doing
	something? I need something to spruce up my Facenote profile.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Alagold
	faced his friend with a warm smile. &ldquo;Totally.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">W-what
	are you going to do?&rdquo; Boo asked, still shaking. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">This.
	I&rsquo;m the strongest toad I know.&rdquo; Buckenberry lift up a
	crate with ease and then tossed it several feet, making it shatter
	on the ground and spill the lichen it contained on the frozen
	terrain. Impressed, Boo began to pay attention closely.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Back
	inside the factory, Luigi and Yoshi hauled the crate past working
	machinery. It was dim and just as chilly as outdoors. Yoshi sniffed
	the ground but couldn't pick up any particular smells over the
	abundance of grime littering the floor. They passed by a hammer
	brother who was looking over a mixing machine.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey,
	sir! Where do we drop off these ingredients? We're new,&rdquo; Luigi
	said cautiously.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	hammer bro turned around, revealing several scars and an eye patch.
	&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always glad to help a fellow Brooklynite! The
	ingredient drop off is right around that corner. If you need to load
	a truck, all the way to the left is the drop off for that. Cheers!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thanks!&rdquo;
	Luigi finally put the pieces together with the accent he&rsquo;d
	heard from the lakitu before. If Lichen Cola had Real World
	connections, what else were they hiding?</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">These
	guys know about New York?&rdquo; Yoshi asked once they&rsquo;d
	walked away.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Apparently.
	That&rsquo;s odd, but not as odd as this.&rdquo; They stopped before
	an area where much larger and heavier crates littered the floor.
	Printed on some were: &lsquo;cherbil sheddings&rsquo;, &lsquo;dirt&rsquo;,
	and &lsquo;lichen&rsquo;. There was also a silver vat with &lsquo;citric
	acid&rsquo;.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	stopped and felt sick to his stomach. &ldquo;Welp, if it wasn&rsquo;t
	the contaminate issue putting me off of this stuff for good, it&rsquo;d
	be that!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Right,
	because they used the shedding from radioactive Cherbils?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	turned around like Yoshi said something dumb. &ldquo;No, they
	include real dirt. How disgusting! Anyway, let&rsquo;s check out the
	truck area. If we can find clues on who ordered my can of soda, we
	might get somewhere.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	nodded as Luigi's statement echoed his own ideas. Luigi was always
	the cleverer brother and if he had to deal with any other hero aside
	from Mario, it&rsquo;d be him.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Going
	around to the truck loading area, they found that the steel mesh
	fence was open, leading outside to a dirt parking lot. Several
	trucks with &lsquo;Lichen Cola&rsquo; on them were parked and empty
	crates were stacked around. They put the crate down and split. Yoshi
	found some crumbs of a &lsquo;peanut butter and toe jam&rsquo;
	sandwich and asked if it was a Brooklyn staple. Luigi assured him
	that it wasn&rsquo;t but jotted the clue down on his phone. Luigi
	found empty cans around, but comparing them to the tampered soda
	with his namesake on it these appeared to be normal. After more
	search, Yoshi called him over to a spot on the side where there were
	some long deep tracks in the mud.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	bent down close. &ldquo;These are koopa tank tracks, I know them
	anywhere!&rdquo; he said triumphantly. &ldquo;..But I don&rsquo;t
	think these guys use tanks so someone else must have dropped by for
	a pick up.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	began to look disapointed. &ldquo;That could be any crook in a tank
	though.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	recorded the tracks. &ldquo;It's still a clue. Let's check back on
	the rest on the other side of the building.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So that's
	where the two green friends were heading when they began to hear
	commotion. Their walk became a sprint as they round the corner to
	find a street fight.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Or dirt
	parkway fight. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I'm
	catching all of this, bro!&rdquo; Alagold held the camera steady
	even if he wasn&rsquo;t as Buckenberry had a koopa wearing
	stereotypical geek wear flipped on his back and pinned down.
	Surrounding them in a semi-circle were a group of young protesters,
	goombas, koopas, buzzy beetles, magikoopas, and more holding signs
	against soda companies and shouting.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	gaped. &ldquo;What the heck happened?!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo
	popped up from the crate they were hiding in. &ldquo;They just
	showed up out of nowhere!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">But
	where are the people that work here?&rdquo; Yoshi asked.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo
	pointed over to a little area were there were some over turned
	barrels being used as seating. The weirdo workers were present and
	ignoring everything as before, only now during their lunch break.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There
	you are, scum!&rdquo; A goomba girl with purple hair and piercings
	broke out of the crowd to rush at Luigi and scream through a
	megaphone.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	shrugged. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">When
	Fungus Up went down, we realized it was time to make everyone else
	accept responsibility for their atrocities against taste and
	humanity!&rdquo; The other protesters cheered with her, aside from
	the koopa Buckenberry was still restraining who instead whimpered
	something about how being a &lsquo;white knight&rsquo; was hard.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">But
	we don&rsquo;t actually work here,&rdquo; Luigi said calmly. Yoshi,
	Boo, and Alagold nodded not so calmly, but the point was still made.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Are
	you sure?&rdquo; a boomerang bro wearing a black trench coat and a
	trilby accused. &ldquo;You ARE always pictured drinking Lichen Cola
	at sports events!&rdquo; The other protesters agreed.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No,
	I gave it up because they use real dirt! Real dirt! Besides, we&rsquo;re
	investigating an issue where soda has been contaminated-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Uh,
	excuse me!?&rdquo; the goomba interrupt. &ldquo;Are you trying to
	explain over me with logic? That&rsquo;s offensive!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	slap his forehead. &ldquo;Okay now this is just plain stupid.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Buckenberry
	got off of the nerd. &ldquo;Yeah it is. I need to fight someone that
	looks tougher if I&rsquo;m going to impress women online.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">How
	about me, huh?&rdquo; A whomp in the crowd waddled up and shoved
	Buckenberry down hard.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Stop
	filming! Stop filming!&rdquo; Buckenberry shout as he was chased
	around by the one ton slab of social reformer, trying to avoid being
	squashed.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Everyone,
	huddle up!&rdquo; Luigi called out. They did so, all forming a
	little circle like in American football, minus the blue capped toad.
	&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in over our heads here so it&rsquo;s time for my
	special technique that works 100% of the time when something is too
	dangerous or stupid for me to deal with.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
	could that be?&rdquo; Boo asked eagerly.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	smiled. &ldquo;I wait for Mario to deal with it!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Inside
	the factory, Mario and Bowser were lead by Jose to his office where
	he was supposed to be finding for them whatever records he could
	scrap up with the computers being down. While standing around,
	Bowser thought of something.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Plumber,
	why did you end up locked up anyway? That ain&rsquo;t your style I
	know.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	eyed him with some annoyance. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get your hopes up,
	It wasn&rsquo;t anything on purpose just&hellip; well.. My work
	uniform wasn&rsquo;t always overalls and so, when you bend over
	sometimes...&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	backed up quickly with his hands out. &ldquo;Whoa whoa whoa. Stop.
	Forget I mentioned that.&rdquo; The Koopa King backed up so much he
	bumped into Jose.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
	two need a moment?&rdquo; he asked, dryly. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	tired and failed to hide embarrassment. &ldquo;No. Go on, or else!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jose
	opened the notebook. &ldquo;Yeah... so it turns out something kind
	of unusual did happen recently. We had an unofficial &lsquo;truck&rsquo;
	marked as privately owned order a bunch of Lichen Cola the other
	day. We did make them sign before they left.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	observed the odd looking signature. &ldquo;B-a-d-d-i-e?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	snatched the notebook and held it close to his face. &ldquo;Rebel
	factions use that name in Dark Land to be anonymous but really they
	can come from anywhere. They&rsquo;re just punks basically...&rdquo;
	In the back of his mind, Bowser also found the handwriting oddly
	familiar.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	began to pace. &ldquo;-So if this is a criminal thing, it wouldn&rsquo;t
	be a stretch to connect them to this resealing business. Maybe they
	just tainted some cans by mistake and they got mixed up around Toad
	Town.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jose
	nodded impressively. &ldquo;Not a bad detective are ya? We oughtta
	get that computer fixed so we can properly document this stuff with
	descriptions and whatnot.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	stopped and pouted. &ldquo;Wait, so you didn&rsquo;t see any faces
	or the truck they picked it up in?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Nope.
	Wasn&rsquo;t working that shift. But I tell you what, if I find
	out-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There was
	a sudden crash then a loud thunk of a brick hitting the floor in
	front of the building. Jose started to mutter in Spanish as he head
	outdoors with Mario and Bowser following. Outside they saw the
	protesters and everyone else waiting patiently with Luigi standing
	right at the door for them. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jose
	didn&rsquo;t bat an eye at the scene. &ldquo;Oh these kind of
	people.&rdquo; He yawned and then went back indoors.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	goomba girl stepped forward again. &ldquo;The soda companies
	domination ends today! We have flash protesters all over!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Waitaminute,
	I know y'all! They&rsquo;re some of the Dark Land debate team and
	they hang out with Wendy O. Koopa!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Everyone
	stared at Bowser.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
	sent them here??&rdquo; Mario asked.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No&hellip;
	I&hellip; Actually I have no idea what&rsquo;s going on. You can
	continue your regularly scheduled stupid.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Who
	threw the brick?&rdquo; Mario asked.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Me.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Why
	did you do that, Luigi?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	figured it&rsquo;d attract you guys here,&rdquo; Luigi explain like
	it was obvious. &ldquo;Now go ahead and give that rousing speech you
	were preparing to give at Mushroom College about improving friendly
	to enemy species relations.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	blinked twice. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
	are you going to say that will possibly make us not want to scream
	some more, you mass murderer??&rdquo; the goomba girl challenged.
	&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Raven by the way and I study social studies at
	Koopa College. If you&rsquo;d like to give a recommendation for me
	that&rsquo;d be totally awesome since you are Mario and all..&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	cleared his throat, confused. &ldquo;Well...&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser,
	covered in sweat from the long trek away from Lichen Cola, ran onto
	the moving bus and plopped down next to Luigi and Boo.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Good
	idea having that idiot plumber make a fool of himself so that we
	could make a run for the bus stop.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	shot up like waking from a bad dream. &ldquo;So you mean he&rsquo;s
	still back there?!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi,
	who sat on the next row, slapped his face, harder. &ldquo;For the
	love of-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Alagold&rsquo;s
	face was pressed against the back window. &ldquo;Oh snap, bro. Here
	he comes.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	others rushed to the back of the bus to see Mario running for his
	life in attempt to catch up with the bus that steadily gained speed.
	Behind him were the protesters and the usually apathetic Lichen Cola
	workers, who managed to get offended somehow at Mario&rsquo;s
	speech. Honestly, it offended his friends too, which is why they
	left him. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Someone
	pry this emergency door open.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Buckenberry
	brushed past Yoshi to pry it open, breaking off the latch entirely
	and making the door fall to the road, where it subsequently tripped
	up Mario and made his face plant against the road.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	jump out of the bus with a rolling start. He met with Mario and
	picked him up, but that let the group catch up closely to them. They
	both got hit on the head repeatedly by broken bottles from the
	Lichen Cola workers, and some of the protesters were getting
	dangerously close with pointy picket signs. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
	need me,&rdquo; Buckenberry said, fists shaking. He hopped off and
	promptly got ran over by everyone, tripping them up.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	don&rsquo;t see the problem with a bunch of shy guys wearing tutu&rsquo;s
	chasing everyone...&rdquo; Alagold blinked twice as in that moment
	his medication wore off. &ldquo;OH MY GOD, BLUE?!&rdquo; he shriek,
	hurling himself off the bus to aid Buckenberry. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo
	turned to Luigi. &ldquo;Umm. I think I should do something.&rdquo;
	Boo jumped off and used their invisibility to help out, only with
	the close contact their power sort of applied to everyone and now no
	one on the road could see anyone. All that could be heard were
	grunts of pain coming from the invisables.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	have a better idea!&rdquo; Luigi said, standing proud. Luigi went up
	to the driver. &ldquo;Could you please stop for one second? My
	brother was supposed to be on here with us.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The old
	penguin driver with a white beard smiled. &ldquo;Sure sonny!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The bus
	eased into a stop and with that, Mario, Yoshi, Boo, Alagold, and
	Buckenberry eventually fought off enough of the protesters and
	workers to came aboard. Bowser who hadn&rsquo;t moved gave the
	exactly one clap of applause. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Then they
	all fell out in exhaustion. Luigi stood around in the midst of
	everyone unconscious. &ldquo;Well, I guess there&rsquo;s nothing for
	me to do but go over the clues!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	gave Luigi a condescending look like he was a joke.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Didn&rsquo;t
	you learn anything?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	pointed to him with his thumb. &ldquo;Yeah. Deal is, you&rsquo;re a
	loser.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi sat
	in a seat dejectedly. &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll work with my own
	clues then. A Dark Land tank visited at some point.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	whipped towards him. &ldquo;Then it was a home grown &lsquo;Baddie&rsquo;
	after all! They ordered the custom case of Lichen.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Interesting.
	So the facts are: We know that only resealed cans are contaminated,
	meaning that it isn&rsquo;t the companies but rather someone
	privately buying them. Someone custom ordered some Lichen cola,
	including the personalized one I&rsquo;m holding, and they used a
	Dark Land tank and went under &lsquo;Baddie.&rsquo; One problem. At
	this point we can&rsquo;t definitively prove that the people who
	ordered them are the same that resealed them. We&rsquo;d better head
	to Morel Moxie to see what else we can find.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	again looked at him funny. &ldquo;Green Mario, where the heck did
	that detective cap come from?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	took it off, winking. &ldquo;And you thought this was just a visual
	gag!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The trip
	away from Fahr Outpost was a long one, so much so that Mario and the
	rest were back up by the time the bus stop under a street lamp. It
	was dark now as they observed the plain one story building located
	on a residential street with other business and even a few homes
	down the block. On the top was &lsquo;Morel Moxie&rsquo; written in
	neon lights and the inside of the building looked dark. There wasn&rsquo;t
	even a car in the parking lot.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	think they&rsquo;re closed...&rdquo; Mario lament. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Not
	if I have anything to say about it.&rdquo; Bowser step ahead to bang
	on the door. Suddenly a bright flash light was shown on all seven. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Halt!&rdquo;
	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They spun
	around to see the toad security guard with a blue suit and
	sunglasses at night.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
	along story but we just needed info on if someone&rsquo;s
	contaminated your soda,&rdquo; Mario said.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The guard
	shrugged. &ldquo;This is just the office and storage distributor.
	Morel Moxie is manufactured all the way at Mt. Teapot.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well,
	since you do at least store them here, did anyone under the name of
	&lsquo;Baddie&rsquo; in maybe a tank or something order a bunch
	recently?&rdquo; Yoshi asked.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The guard
	brought everyone to his car that was around back. Opening the door
	revealed a screen attached to the dash board. &ldquo;We can see
	security footage here. I record everything.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo was
	especially impressed since they were typically so paranoid. &ldquo;They
	let you guys do this? Cool, hehe.&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Actually&hellip;
	they don&rsquo;t. But I&rsquo;m not weird or anything!&rdquo; he
	randomly outburst. &ldquo;Anyway, here&rsquo;s the time frame
	matching your description of &lsquo;Baddie&rsquo; and &lsquo;tank&rsquo;.

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Footage
	played of two sumo brothers loading a cart full of Morel Moxie into
	a small tank.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser

	go find her! Someone pick up that trash.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;ll
	do it!&rdquo; Lemmy sang as he rolled on his ball to get the scrap.
	He tossed it like a basketball into the nearest grimy overfilled
	trash receptacle but it bounced off of the top and hit the floor
	again.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	facepalm. &ldquo;That reminds me. Where is our garbage collector?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy
	waved a hand. &ldquo;Oh that! He&rsquo;s the one we sent with the
	soda&rsquo;s right? He hasn&rsquo;t been back in the castle if you
	check the time clock.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Does
	that matter, huh?&rdquo; Roy asked. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yes
	it does,&rdquo; Ludwig replied sharply as he marched up to Roy.
	&ldquo;There are enough complications with news of Fungus Up going
	down. We need to head to the princess&rsquo;s castle and make our
	ransom case now!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Once
	again, the muscle bound Roy grabbed Ludwig in a choke hold to give
	him a noogie.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lame.
	I&rsquo;m going back inside now.&rdquo; Larry turned his back to
	leave when a large shadow appeared over him.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Everyone
	run!!!&rdquo; Morton shout.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A large
	doomship dove towards the ground from the skies above with a smoke
	trail. Everyone promptly evacuated as the ship bumped a tower on top
	of Bowser&rsquo;s Castle and crash land in the yard, digging deep
	into the ground and sending red dirt high into the air. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	coughed violently and shook the dust off himself. &ldquo;What in
	Eldstar&rsquo;s name is wrong with that crazy woman?!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	shopped till she dropped!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	tossed another scrap paper at Wendy as the door of the airship was
	kicked open and out came the old magikoopa woman with arms full of
	merchandise. She clumsily strolled where they were, the random
	shopping and gift bags so large they couldn&rsquo;t see her under it
	all.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ooh
	ooh ooh? Did you get me something??&rdquo; Morton begged right away,
	following her around. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	dropped a little pink bag on the ground for him and he scooped it up
	instantly, ripping it up to get to it's innards. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bubble
	Candy brand eyeliner in a shade of luscious blue?? Well my style is
	usually more dark, black, and masculine but no one ever gives me
	anything so I will accept, graciously, eagerly, heartily!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wendy&rsquo;s
	eyes were popping out of her head and not just because some dust had
	got in them. &ldquo;Kammy girlfriend, you actually went to some
	neato places like Banana Bird Republic?! Zomg!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">More
	alarmingly, why is the airship still on fire?&rdquo; Lemmy asked. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Blast
	it! Blast it all!&rdquo; Ludwig ran ahead to dash inside he airship,
	making Kammy spin in place and drop the rest of the bags. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	oil had not been changed before the trip!!&rdquo; everyone heard him
	yell.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kammy
	adjusted her bifocal lenses and shrugged. &ldquo;I knew I had forgot
	something. Oh well, I have an overnight spa reserved for tomorrow,
	dearie. I'll be needing the ship again later tonight.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	exited the ship fuming so much his face, cheeks, and everything else
	was red hot. &ldquo;Tonight?! You have all sensors on red, the
	furniture wasn't nailed down so they are now strolled everywhere,
	and it smells like takeout. You have delayed our departure by at
	least several hours!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yay!&rdquo;
	cheered the six other Koopalings and one old Magikoopa who wasn't
	sure why she was cheering, but did it anyway to spite her pompous
	blue haired grandson. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It was
	evening in Toad Town when secret agent Jelectro Bond and the ace
	reporter Kylie Koopa returned to Mushroom Kingdom East hospital to
	get to the bottom of what was really going on. With their backs
	against the wall, Bond made sure the belt was secure around Kylie.
	The trek straight up was simple enough, aside from the spotlights
	that move left and right as they swept across the sides of the
	building, and the laser guided alarm systems which would alert the
	hospital's security personnel instantly. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thanks,
	Bond. This is only the fifth time I've done this in the search for a
	scoop. Least I don't see armed guards this time or hungry chomps.
	Just in case, I do have a juicy steak in the purse though.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond
	smiled at her preparation for the task at hand, but not the view
	upwards, because he was the one walking on the side of the building
	above her, providing HER the view of his butt. All of a sudden,
	disaster struck when a blinding spotlight caught them half way up
	the wall.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
	snap!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	got this, mon ami!&rdquo; Bond spun while keeping one hand on the
	rope and shot at the spotlight with his pistol. It burst and spark,
	casting darkness over them once again.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Now
	let us hurry before they investigate!&rdquo; Bond said, pressing
	forward in their gravity defying stunt.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">On the
	roof, the EMT Emery turned down her radio to hear the latest
	announcements on the intercom. The fog lights had just cut on
	moments ago and she sat lazily in a lawn chair.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And
	now the total amount of Case X patients have come to sixty,&rdquo;
	the emergency dispatcher downstairs stated. &ldquo;Also&hellip; this
	just in: We have lost a spotlight on the west side of the building.
	Over!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Emery
	sighed. She wished something would happen since there had been no
	airlift patients brought in all day, and she wasn&rsquo;t permitted
	to meddle around, though she certainly had anyway. She found that
	the Case X patients were held in their rooms, some alone, others in
	groups and all tied down to their beds. All had in common the
	consumption of various sodas right before the fall out. Emery was so
	distraught she went straight to her mother but was told to shut up
	essentially. Little did that matriarch and head nurse know, mostly
	due to not spending much time with her daughter outside of work,
	Emery lacked the air of obsequiousness of other toads and did the
	logical thing. Untie several at once and cause rampages until Emery
	was caught herself and restrained. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Now she
	was back on the roof alone and not fired only because no one wanted
	to replace her job position, shackled now with a ball and chain. She
	was suddenly startled by noises near edge of the roof. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Who
	goes there?!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
	me and we&rsquo;re here to investigate stuff!&rdquo; Kylie said as
	she and Bond climbed over the edge. Neither showed any signs of
	exhaustion as they quickly abandoned the ropes and belt evidence
	they had to espionage. They joined her at her station, consisting of
	the chair, radio, laptop connected to the hospitals&rsquo; mainframe
	and big bulls-eye target for airships to land if that could be
	counted. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Case
	X? Guys, I already figured it all out!&rdquo; Emery beamed proudly.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You..
	have, mon ami?&rdquo; Bond asked, eyeing her curiously. &ldquo;I am
	Jelectro by the way, and I see you and Kylie know each other
	already.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Emery
	shook his outreached hand. &ldquo;Uh huh, we went to college
	together. Sir, you look like a noki to me rather than a jelectro,
	but I won&rsquo;t judge. Not even the sunglasses at night part. I
	like your style actually, like are you from around here?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yes
	and no,&rdquo; he answered truthfully. &ldquo;What have you found,
	miss?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Emery
	described what she saw in her own words. By the time she was done
	talking, Bond was already heading down stairs.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond?&rdquo;
	Kylie called.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	will meet back up with you!&rdquo; he said, not turning back.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Emery sat
	in her lawn chair. &ldquo;Whoa!.. That was weird. Who is he again?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Just..
	a dude that really needs to see a relative I guess.&rdquo; Kylie
	could have sworn that he once told her that he didn&rsquo;t have any
	family&hellip;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
	okay. I would have found out more if I didn&rsquo;t get myself stuck
	up here until midnight when my mom gets off work. See?&rdquo; She
	pointed to the ball and chain. &ldquo;Gosh, this sucks!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It
	does.&rdquo; Kylie knew a way out of that sort of thing but thought
	it best to not get the youngster in anymore trouble. &ldquo;If you
	say it&rsquo;s soda, I&rsquo;m thinking contamination.&rdquo; Kylie
	flipped back a few pages in her notebook. &ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t
	happened in a while but me and that ol&rsquo; Mitch back in the day
	exposed a few companies who tainted their sealed foods and such, but
	that was a bit before your time. We couldn&rsquo;t even afford
	cellphones then.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">When
	was that?!&rdquo; Emery gasped. &ldquo;The stone ages?&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Close.
	The 90s, whatta era. Anyway, I doubt these big businesses have
	fallen into that trap again. Maybe someone on the outside has done
	it. Think about it. What unites us all together? Young, old,
	whatever?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Watching
	the Mushroom Bowl on tv?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After
	that.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">When
	Zip T. comes to town?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No,
	sis. It&rsquo;s soda,&rdquo; Kylie said in a tone verging on
	annoyance. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re super popular and sponsor Mario
	sports. If don&rsquo;t care about your health you drink it. If want
	to pretend to care about your health, you drink it, just in diet. If
	you&rsquo;re rich and fancy, you still drink it but you call it
	&lsquo;pop&rsquo; so you don&rsquo;t sound like us normal poor folk.
	You said you didn&rsquo;t notice a pattern among the sick, so
	someone wanted to target mass amounts of people, and knew exactly
	how to do it.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wow!
	That was awesome, but I&rsquo;d already figured that out because
	that&rsquo;s all we drink at school! I even know how the mystery
	assailant did it. By means of a teleporter to teleport the germs in
	the can.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Now Kylie
	was the one eyeing the young girl curiously. &ldquo;Umm, well we
	still need to figure out what&rsquo;s up with this hospital. You
	haven&rsquo;t already figured that out, have you?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No,
	I&rsquo;ll leave it to you guys. You should probably leave. Like, we
	have cameras.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Then,
	Kylie thought she heard a low growl of a hungry guard chomp.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">... </font>
	</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond was
	on the third floor of the hospital in search of Agent N&rsquo;s
	niece. The hall was lined with doors and he&rsquo;d surely be
	detained before he could search them all. A nurse was came around
	the corner pushing a cart with a laptop on it playing a video of the
	Koopa Winfrey show. &ldquo;You get a new kart!&rdquo; she said to a
	goomba family. &ldquo;You get a new kart!&rdquo; she then said
	pointing to a homely looking hammer brother. &ldquo;And YOU get a
	kart!&rdquo; she finally said to a toad family of five who looked
	like bums with dirty patched together clothes and unkempt hair.
	(They would later be revealed as professional con artists in post
	production.)</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	gotta get on this show!&rdquo; the shy guy nurse said, so
	preoccupied with his viewing of the magnanimous talk show host that
	he walked past Bond as if he was invisible.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Excuse
	me sir, I&rsquo;m looking for a young yoshi girl,&rdquo; Bond said. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Room
	888,&rdquo; the nurse droned, never turning away from the computer.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Excellent.&rdquo;
	Bond thought, knowing his powers hadn&rsquo;t failed yet. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Inside
	the dimly lit room were five people strapped down to beds. Bond
	inched closer. Some lay motionless while others squirmed around
	moaning, with Agent N&rsquo;s niece being one of the latter. It
	became obvious by sight and smell no less, that patient in the room
	had been tended to for at least several hours.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond
	rubbed between his eyes, feeling sick suddenly. He slipped out of
	the room and marched straight to the elevator before hesitating.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Merde,&rdquo;
	he lament.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie was
	also having second guesses. She went straight downstairs to speak to
	Emery&rsquo;s mother, but stopped short when she saw the dark
	mushroom behind the glass receptionist window. It was certainly the
	right toad, but Nass was looking baleful in the unlit office with
	only the screen of her computer casting shadows on her normally flat
	features, now seeming to be permanently contorted into a scowl.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Biting
	back reservations, Kylie pressed on. She knocked on the glass and
	Nass&rsquo;s white face met hers.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
	again?!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well,
	since I&rsquo;m in. You might as well answer stuff.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
	are not a patient and I am not obligated to share any of our
	secrets.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	thought she must have imagined she heard that last word. &ldquo;But,
	I am actually. You see, my back still hurts from when your two
	Glitzville rejects tackled me like a pancake! Why aren&rsquo;t you
	treating anyone?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
	are only following protocols from our superiors!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Who?
	Cause it ain&rsquo;t the princess. I saw you kick her out with my
	own eyes and I took pictures too, so don&rsquo;t try nothing funny!&rdquo;
	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	didn&rsquo;t know what was going to happen next with the glare she
	received. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...Why
	don&rsquo;t I refer you to Doctor Professor Koopa? He&rsquo;s right
	around the office, thank you,&rdquo; Nass said icily.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	shrugged it off. &ldquo;I will. Thanks...&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She found
	Dr. Professor Koopa&rsquo;s office locked up and empty, not that she
	was expecting anything else. Back near the lobby, but out of sight
	of Nass was Bond sitting down when she returned. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	relative is here,&rdquo; he said with an edge in his voice before
	Kylie was close enough to sit down.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Good?&hellip;
	Or is that bad?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond
	grabbed her arms suddenly but kelp his tone down. &ldquo;Can I trust
	you to not reveal to anyone my association with this matter? Someone
	has hired members of the staff to hold the Case X patients here
	without treatment!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	froze. &ldquo;How the heck did you figure out that crazier than a
	dayzee plot?!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond drew
	a blank for an explanation. Somehow, I used by special alien
	brainwave technique to read it off of a nurse in passing
	(telepathy), didn&rsquo;t seem like an appropriate reply.</font></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<hr/>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It
	can&rsquo;t all be traced back to me, right? I never thought about
	cameras..&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	Diddley then hummed along to the radio for a moment, as if that
	brief panic attack never happened, while his cab cruised through
	Toad Town. He was actually the driver, and the cabbie his passenger,
	but it still was his cab. He&rsquo;d paid for exactly seventy
	percent of the tab earlier after all. By the way, his passenger was
	actually stuffed in the trunk. The windows were rolled down and cool
	breezes blew that neck tie in the air, now attached to its original
	owner and hanging out of the back of the car.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	mean, like yeah, I did deliver it to the two freaks uh, what&rsquo;s
	even their name?&rdquo; Zoo slapped his forehead. &ldquo;Whatever, I
	delivered two sodas at the tennis game and then left one at a house.
	The rest I dumped all at this free drink stand.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After a
	while of swerving in and out of lanes, Zoo laughed wildly. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
	know in Dark Land, this could have never worked. Everyone would have
	known that a free soda must be poisoned or something..&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He&rsquo;d
	always loved how the city looked at night and it went alone
	perfectly with the talking to himself like a loon. People aimlessly
	walking the streets, the businesses selling over priced power ups,
	bums living in boxes, that sort of deal was one thing he missed
	about living in Toad Town before getting a job at Bowser&rsquo;s
	Castle. But, it would be time to get back. He was still on the
	clock&hellip;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Trying to
	figure out where to go next, Zoo stopped the car where Starman Lane
	met the far end of Royal Raceway for a moment apparently too long.
	He saw in his rear view the honking car behind him. The dark boo got
	out and the driver of the muscle did. The purple pianta wearing a
	blue jacket towered over Zoo, being at least six feet tall. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What&rsquo;s
	da hold up?!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	hospital must have gotten up and moved since I last lived here,&rdquo;
	Zoo said, more to himself than the burly pianta who then shoved him
	down to the pavement with ease.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	pianta&rsquo;s passenger in the car, another just like him only with
	blue skin tossed a two foot long wrench to his partner. Zoo shot up
	from the ground just in time to be cracked over the head with the
	over sized tool.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
	bust him up something good, eh?&rdquo; the wrench carrying pianta
	gloated before seizing suddenly. The wrench fell from his hands as
	he grabbed his neck. His face became a pale pink and his black eyes
	began to bulge. Zoo took that moment to pick up the wrench and bash
	him in the face one good time. The giant fell backwards, now holding
	his face and crushed nose. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
	s-&rdquo; The guy in the car didn&rsquo;t get to finish the
	expletive before Zoo broke out the windshield with the wrench,
	making glass rain on him. The pianta dashed out of the car and ran
	aimlessly down the sidewalk, shoving past people who didn&rsquo;t
	seem to notice or care of what had transpired. Zoo simply tossed the
	new weapon in the backseat into the cab and drove off as another
	song he liked began to play.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So,
	yeah. Have you even owned a phone before? The Mushroom Press had
	this cool one.&rdquo; Zoo frowned as he heard an imaginary reply.
	&ldquo;Screw you, then. That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re stuffed in the
	trunk. Oh, look! Tourists! I&rsquo;ll ask them.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With the
	sound of something scraping, Zoo pulled on the sidewalk of a
	playground that was in Toad Town&rsquo;s park. In the late hour two
	toad children were sitting around looking bored in the play ground
	with no parents in sight. Zoo began to smell leaking oil, so he
	abandoned the car just as the cab&rsquo;s engine caught on fire. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mister?&rdquo;
	The little boy from the sandbox lips quivered in view of the
	inferno. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey,
	uh, where&rsquo;s the hospital?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The boy
	pointed to the left. &ldquo;Are you okay?!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The other
	kid who was older frowned. &ldquo;Do we need to call someone?&rdquo;
	she asked.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo&rsquo;s
	head was killing him to the point of seeing black spots in his
	vision. &ldquo;Nah, I feel fine. Why are you kids just standing
	around?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The two
	kids looked at each other for a brief second, then the boy pointed
	again, this time to the broken swing set on the right. It was part
	of a neat play area with jungle gyms and nets to climb. Almost like
	a circus... </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">One
	second.&rdquo; Zoo rescued the bloody wrench from the backseat and
	only got slightly burned. &ldquo;Have fun.&rdquo; Zoo tossed it to
	the older girl who could barely carry it.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Not far
	from the hospital, Zoo simply walked as the kids thanking him became
	inaudible in the distance.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	should try this prank again if I ever get a job where I have a
	phone. I mean, I could have pretended to be something a lot cooler I
	guess but, oh whatever..&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">In the
	hospital&rsquo;s parking lot, Zoo spotted Mitch&rsquo;s Lexus. He
	knew it was the one. It had that dent Zoo put in the passenger rear
	door with his motor bike that morning. To think, that green mushroom
	noticed the trailer he pulled along with it and knew what was really
	up along with that Susie Que persona, yet here Zoo was all most
	getting away with all if he could tie up one loose end. Or one in a
	half. Cowards like Mitch didn&rsquo;t deserve to be considered
	obstacles. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hi,
	Mitch.&rdquo; Zoo grin inches away from the rolled down window and
	the toad let out an ear piercing screech of horror. Off it sped out
	of the lot to Zoo&rsquo;s not at all surprise.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Just as
	soon as he walked in, someone was up in his face scrutinizing him
	for a moment and then giving a thumbs up to the person in the
	reception window. Nass. 49? Not married. One kid that was birthed
	late. Red underwear, always. Zoo was never the best cold reader but
	he got what he needed, namely that he&rsquo;d have to do something
	about the broad along with the guy he actually pulled the prank on
	that morning...</font></p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Doctor
	Professor Koopa had a folder full of contracts and checked his phone
	every five minutes for news of what was to come. His heart ache both
	from the constant running around he&rsquo;d done to avoid the many
	questions and concerns of his fellow staff, but also out of guilt.
	He was fully aware that he might not have a job once this was over.
	Thing was, with the one million coins he&rsquo;d earn, he wouldn&rsquo;t
	need one.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	doctor pulled on the door handle of his office to find it wouldn't
	open. His blood ran cold as he pulled again and again. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Let
	me assist,&rdquo; said a short little man, pushing the door open
	with ease to allow the doctor in.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thank
	you,&rdquo; Doctor Professor told the man and his companion.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No
	problem, fella. In fact, we&rsquo;ve been waiting for you,&rdquo;
	the companion said. Right behind the doctor, she closed the door and
	locking herself and the man in. They stood with their backs against
	the door watching him take his seat. In that moment, Doctor
	Professor knew he&rsquo;d mucked up.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Who
	hired you?!&rdquo; Kylie questioned.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Doctor
	Professor put his hands up. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly. He
	was anonymous until tomorrow when he would give-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond
	flipped open the folder, making the papers fly all over the office.
	One landed right on his head. &ldquo;He worked for a rival hospital
	in Giant Land and wanted to ruin the reputation here?? You would
	really put dozens at risk for that reward??&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">As Kylie
	thought something about that sounded familiar, Doctor Professor sunk
	beneath his desk. &ldquo;It was only for today,&rdquo; he said
	feebly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve even arranged for a partner hospital to
	pick them all up tomorrow and Nass ealier sent for a special agency
	to pick up two of the more influential that were sick. With our
	superiors making us drop the Princess&rsquo;s support, it was only a
	matter of time before we were out of business any way!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	went around his desk to drag him up roughly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the
	one who dropped her, but as if that matters at this point. You
	agreed to conspiracy and we caught you.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A badge
	emerged from Bond&rsquo;s flowery shirt pocket. &ldquo;And now you
	will be fixing this.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">CODE
	RED:: ALL STAFF REPORT TO FRONT!!&rdquo; the radio said.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	spun towards the intercom. &ldquo;What the heck?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Watch
	him!&rdquo; Bond said, speeding back out the door.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	stood near the doctor who shook in fear for a moment. &ldquo;Now I
	remember, someone heard of a rumor that they wanted to sabotage you
	guys at the press and Steve was so proud the newspaper clips are
	still posted up in his office. People from Giant Land are such
	jerks. You ain&rsquo;t from there, are you?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">O-oh
	no!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie was
	getting annoyed at the constant whimpering. &ldquo;Aww, keep your
	tears to yourself. We exposed it and it turned out false. Or&hellip;
	not. Wait, you ARE sure they contacted you, right?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Doctor
	Professor leaned up in his seat just enough to point to a memo on
	his desk, not far from the computer. Kylie saw the number of his
	conspirator felt herself quake. It was the public phone at the
	Mushroom Press! Still staring in disbelief, she heard a scream from
	a young lady not far from the door. She peek outside just in time to
	see two nurses have to drag a hysterical Emery away. Kylie quickly
	followed.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
	happened?!&rdquo; she asked to get no reply. The front lobby was
	filled with many members of staff crowding around the window where
	Nass was stationed. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
	my goodness gracious!&rdquo; one older nurse exclaimed, having to
	fan herself.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A blue
	shy guy that was nearest to the window ran away from it, mentioning
	that he was going to be sick. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A whomp
	doctor in white coat and with a stethoscope around his neck waddled
	around the corner holding a heavy set of keys. He unlocked the door
	into Nass&rsquo;s office from the side and immediately began to
	grumble in distress.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	slipped around the nurses to see for herself. Emery&rsquo;s mother
	was head down on her keyboard with a dark crimson pool of blood
	originating from somewhere under her black hair. Still on the
	computer screen were charts and graphs like this happened abruptly
	while she worked. Bond came up behind her.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	has suffered brain trauma, I feel it, but-&rdquo; Bond paused.
	&ldquo;Wait, go back to Doctor Professor Koopa&rsquo;s office. Now,
	mon ami!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	followed his orders somewhat reluctantly. Surely the blundering
	doctor hadn&rsquo;t gotten the slip so soon. Kylie checked inside to
	see the doctor also slumped across his desk. She shook him a few
	times as he just seemed sleep until some blood began to pour from
	his nose. A chill went down Kylie&rsquo;s spine as she gasped and
	backed up. Just then, the door opened and closed like something
	invisible had step out. She wasn&rsquo;t sure if her own brain was
	working at that point when she followed it outside to see the door
	right next to Doctor Professor&rsquo;s office open and close. In she
	barged into the other office, which had a window that was currently
	opening and closing itself. She heard a curse from a voice and then
	a whooshing sound. It was a boo.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	didn&rsquo;t bother with locks, she hurled herself out of the window
	to land in the bushes. D&eacute;j&agrave; vu she thought, feeling
	the prickly leaves and shrubs scrap against her skin. Apparently the
	assailant thought so too.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ouch,&rdquo;
	she heard a low voice say.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	sprung out of the bushes just in time to face&hellip; &lsquo;Susie
	Que&rsquo;.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey,
	Kylie.&rdquo; Zoo&rsquo;s smile faltered. &ldquo;Oh, dang...&rdquo;
	The dark boo ran into the darkness just as police sirens began to
	blare coming down the street. Before Kylie could give chase, he was
	gone and she didn&rsquo;t even get to snap a picture.</font></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">In the
	darkness Princess Peach opened and closed the castle doors as
	quietly as she could. She ran up to hug Mario, who was just dropped
	off the bus along with Luigi and Bowser. Boo, Alagold, and
	Buckenberry were dropped off earlier to their homes and Yoshi to a
	subway station. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;m
	so glad you are safe, but...&rdquo; she let her words trail off when
	she saw Bowser lingering in the back.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	pointed a thumb. &ldquo;Oh, him. We can explain.&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah,
	he personally knows who might be responsible for the disease
	knocking people out at your hospital,&rdquo; Luigi said, feeling
	great until the Princess frowned.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It
	is not my hospital anymore,&rdquo; she said quietly. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
	did we miss?&rdquo; Mario asked.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
	can forget that for now, who was responsible?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser?
	Come on.&rdquo; Mario motioned. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	still stood back with his arms crossed. &ldquo;How do I know I won&rsquo;t
	get shot?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
	pretend to be offended. &ldquo;Bowser, I would never resort to such
	violence! You may share what you have to say.&rdquo; Behind her
	back, she gave a sign to the toad that was on the roof belly down,
	just itching to use his old trusty war issued super scope, but alas
	it wouldn't be tonight. Or would it?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	came up clumsily. &ldquo;Uh, yeah so I&rsquo;d fired two people in
	the castle who&rsquo;d been ordering things from Fleabay and
	shipping it to my castle, stealing, and caught texting too much.
	Their names are Sam and Slam koopa, two sumo brother twins, and we
	saw them on security cams doing something with soda.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
	nodded thoughtfully. &ldquo;But what did they do to soda?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	showed her his can of Lichen Cola. &ldquo;See that smooth seal on
	the top? It&rsquo;s a reproduction. We could never discern a motive
	however.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	shook a fist. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t matter. We have names so now we
	can start our witch hunt- I mean, our justice enforcement league
	against them, starting tomorrow!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah!&rdquo;
	Luigi raised his fist.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	agree!&rdquo; Peach was suddenly into it as well. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	stared in bafflement for a moment, but then submitted his own
	gesture involving his fist, only directed into Mario&rsquo;s side
	which sent him spiraling into Peach&rsquo;s sandy pathways. Bowser
	guffawed. &ldquo;So... we&rsquo;re all &lsquo;cool&rsquo; right now?
	I mean, at least until the next game or sport or whatever, right?&rdquo;
	</font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sure.&rdquo;
	Mario said annoyingly getting up. &ldquo;I know we butted heads at
	times, but we managed to make it work. Hey, is that your ride coming
	to get you?&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	turned towards the sky, seeing his very own airship heading their
	way. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
	really wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten to this point without Bowser&rsquo;s
	soda tip.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">But
	I&rsquo;m the one that collected most of the other clues!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	get that, little brother but-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	am sure you contributed well, Luigi.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	smiled smugly. &ldquo;Thank you, Princess. At least one person
	appreciates me.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Now the
	airship was above them. Bowser stood in one place waiting for the
	rope to be lowered, though he didn&rsquo;t remember calling for a
	ride in the first place. Ludwig Von Koopa appeared from over the
	edge of the deck with his blue hair and black jacket flowing in the
	wind. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;It
	is I, Ludwig Von Koopa, representing the masterful Koopa Troop!&quot;
	he announced loudly. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Other
	Koopalings and even Kamek peered over the edge with him but it
	didn&rsquo;t have the effect they thought it would. Mario and Luigi
	and even Peach were waving back up at them with smiles.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	want to express my gratitude to the work of your King today!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	stared at Peach like she&rsquo;d grown another head. &ldquo;Whatever
	are you talking about?? Have you noticed what has been going on
	today, or are you plumb stupid?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	laughed dryly. &quot;He&rsquo;s my favorite with those empty
	threats.&quot;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wendy
	is mine...&rdquo; Luigi giggled and waved making the female koopa on
	the ship flirtatiously wave back until Kamek glared at her.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Why
	ain&rsquo;t you picking me up already?! Am I supposed to jump??&rdquo;
	Bowser growled.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Ah,
	well uh, we wanted to announce that.. your friends and others around
	town have the Mushroom Flu and.. uh, if you do not hand over the
	princess-&quot; Ludwig slap his forehead in frustration.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Excuse
	me? I cannot understand you very well with the way you are stumbling
	in your speech!&rdquo; Peach said like it was friendly reminder. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yo,
	they sick cause of us! Now give us the princess so I can go home!&rdquo;
	Larry shout in desperation. The others nodded. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Because
	of&hellip; wait...&rdquo; The cogs in Mario&rsquo;s brain spun as
	the jovial mood on the ground began to go sour as quickly as the
	time limit in New Super Luigi U. &ldquo;But the hospital&hellip;&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
	created the virus in our lab and used soda to distribute it out. If
	you do not hand over the princess right now, you will never get the
	cure you so desperately need!&quot; Ludwig clarified. &ldquo;I know
	nothing of whatever is going on in your hospitals. Why would I?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	slowly spun on his heels to face Bowser, who had been just as
	surprised as Mario and the gang. &ldquo;Umm. Bowser, did you know
	about this?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The hero
	and villain shared no words as they stared each other down in a mix
	of shock and confusion, before Bowser&rsquo;s features contorted
	into a deathly ferocious look. &quot;-What my brats meant was, you
	have until TOMORROW!&quot; he roared. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Murmuring
	came from the airship. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
	heard me! You Mario freaks have until TOMORROW&hellip; morning to do
	something. Now wheel me up, stupids!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	was about to protest before Kamek whacked him in the back of the
	head. &quot;You have heard Lord Bowser. Drop the ladder!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;See
	you losers!&quot; Bowser grabbed the chain that was dropped down.
	The Koopa King was lifted higher and higher into the night sky.
	Luigi ran Peach inside the castle while Toadsworth, who was the
	gunner on the roof, fired to no avail. Only Mario stood still,
	staring into the night sky... </font>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It was a
	dark stormy night at Bowser&rsquo;s Castle...</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	stomp his foot. &ldquo;But why the two idiots I fired for ordering
	junk on Fleabay??&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	suppose it was to avoid your attention,&rdquo; Ludwig explained.
	&ldquo;You would have to admit that Sam and Slam were excellent
	bargainers. To elucidate, they acquired some sodas, including
	&lsquo;reject&rsquo; personalized cans. Afterwards we used a
	resealing contraption to seal the cans after being tainted with a
	live Mushroom Flu virus. Lastly our garbage collector, Zoo Diddley,
	left the cans around Toad Town and/or delivered them to targets if a
	name happened to match up. Simplicity itself, to quote the late
	Professor Kooparity!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	paused. &ldquo;So&hellip; there were never specific targets!?&rdquo;
	he asked, like the answer would determine how badly he hurt the one
	answering.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	felt a sweat coming on. &quot;No, not really. I knew that soda was
	popular and so I took advantage of everyone&rsquo;s snack food
	addiction.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">But
	you still went under my nose.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well...yes,

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser

	Bowser, please remember your blood pressure,&quot; Kamek said,
	entering the throne room and saving Ludwig&rsquo;s tail, though the
	koopaling was sure that last part was unintentional.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	sat back down with a roar.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Here
	are your stories.&rdquo; Kamek handed over a newspaper that Bowser
	held tightly. &ldquo;And in all fairness your evilness, we had no
	idea you were running around with those Mario people all day. You
	would have known about this had you returned home.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kamek,
	that&rsquo;s enough from you too! None of this changes the fact that
	I didn&rsquo;t approve of this plan. I mean, the Princess herself
	could have gotten sick with these random cans everywhere. Both of
	you get out and Ludwig, get to work on the cure anyway. Tonight!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	blinked a few times. &ldquo;Vater, your dissatisfaction with the
	execution aside, why would you not continue the plan? The princess
	will have no choice but to surrender.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Because&hellip;
	We&rsquo;ll never have a tennis match again!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	stayed silent in shock, not at Bowser ruining his plan but rather at
	how much he didn&rsquo;t care that he was being shut down. The
	emotional detachment he felt was almost like the idea was never
	actually from him...</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
	have heard our king!&rdquo; Kamek said, kicking himself out of the
	door like the servile elder he was.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">As
	you wish, vater..&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The heavy
	throne room door closed slowly behind Ludwig when he left. He would
	work all night in the lab to fix this mess and tomorrow morning
	Bowser Junior, who owed Ludwig twenty dollars, would be coming home
	from his overnight Koopa Scouts field trip, so that was a little
	sliver of good news..</font></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mitch&rsquo;s
	car was parked off behind some bushes in Koopa Village and Kylie
	Koopa&rsquo;s house was only a short walk away. He remembered when
	she&rsquo;d first started to rent the small home out. She loved how
	it sat farther back on the property so &lsquo;people couldn&rsquo;t
	go peeping&rsquo; as she&rsquo;d always say...</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He shook
	those thoughts out of his mind. All he needed to do was show her the
	research he&rsquo;d done all evening and then she could be the
	intrepid reporter she always was with a scoop of the century. After
	a few more minutes of waiting, Zoo Diddley knocked on the Lexus
	window. Mitch rolled it down.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hi.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mitch did
	a double take. &ldquo;Hello??&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
	stared at each other for a moment. &ldquo;Oh, so you won&rsquo;t run
	this time? Whatever. I have business with Kylie.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What??
	Why?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	shrugged. &ldquo;She was really cool at the press so I hate to do
	this, but I have to make sure she doesn&rsquo;t snitch. I&rsquo;m
	gonna have to ditch town and she just wouldn&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
	Zoo went straight for Kylie&rsquo;s house.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mitch
	jumped out of the car. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	whipped around. &ldquo;Give it up! You can&rsquo;t stop anything
	from happening because you&rsquo;re too useless. What did Kylie ever
	see in you?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mitch
	lunged and the crafty boo dodged him, making Mitch careen onto the
	gravel walkway and scrape a knee. Zoo reached out an arm and pain
	shot through Mitch&rsquo;s entire body. He gritted his teeth on the
	ground still, too debilitated to move until thoughts of what the
	monster behind him might do to Kylie rejuvenated him for one more
	thing. Mitch stood up with shaky legs. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Are
	you done?&rdquo; Zoo asked, chuckling.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Not
	quite, dude...&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">An
	intense drowsiness fell on Zoo before he could reply. The last thing
	Zoo remembered was Mitch smiling patronizingly as the world became
	dimmer. The stars in the sky blacked out and then he saw nothing
	anymore.</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The young
	person to Zoo Diddley&rsquo;s left nodded once, meaning the coast
	was clear. Zoo pour from his childish some gas onto a bundle of
	sticks from the woods, old fliers, and other junk the two children
	had gathered. It was early morning in the Donut Plains circus
	community where they lived and grew up. Zoo lit a match and engulfed
	the pile in orange yellow flames. Zoo stepped back, but only a bit.
	The heat on his face and the chance that they&rsquo;d get caught any
	moment felt great.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Maybe
	we should be careful, this is dangerous...&rdquo; Zoo&rsquo;s
	step-brother, a Toad with a red cap warned. Zoo&rsquo;s parents
	adopted the abandoned toad around the time Zoo was born, so having
	him as a brother never seemed unusual. It helped that this toad
	certainly had the personality traits of a boo as well.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	noticed that his brother was looking more uncomfortable by the
	second so he decidedly extinguished the fire with a bucket of water.
	Drew always was the &lsquo;smart&rsquo; one and their other forms of
	entertainment didn&rsquo;t leave such obvious beacons of smoke
	leading straight to them. The two children head back to their
	family&rsquo;s tent. Tonight a local show would happen so all of the
	adults were busy, leaving the circus children, specifically the ones
	too young or too unfit to perform, on their own and the Diddley
	brothers were definitely in the &lsquo;unfit&rsquo; category. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Do
	you think,&rdquo; Drew said as he kicked a few rocks, &ldquo;we
	should, umm, check on the cave?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Fine,
	but after dinner.&rdquo; And with that, the conversation was over
	until the eight year olds reached their tent. It was larger and more
	decorated than the rest and had a sign posted saying: &lsquo;The
	Juggling Diddley&rsquo;.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lou
	Diddley twitched his pink ears as his sons entered. He was a
	blindfold boo and wore a vibrant blue sparkly outfit with a matching
	blindfold, his typical getup when amazing audiences with his ability
	to juggle numerous flaming and sharp objects. But there was more,
	both brothers knew their father was rarely found inside the tent on
	a show night.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well?
	Come inside. Both of you,&rdquo; Lou said once they&rsquo;d stood at
	the opening for too long. His normal whisper quiet voice had an edge
	to it. As Zoo and Drew obeyed, their mother, a red boo entered the
	tent from the back holding a potato sack with lots of clattering
	objects in it. This made Drew flush and even Zoo found himself
	shaken, especially when their mother dumped the contents on the
	ground. Knives, daggers, and swords spilled out on the floor, some
	clean, some not.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">D-dad!&rdquo;
	Drew sputtered. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re so sorry I-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	punched him in the side and he shut up. Their parents had only
	discovered their play tools not the cave, a random alcove near the
	circus camp sight. He and Drew had so much fun there involving the
	local wildlife critters. So much fun&hellip;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
	were just using those to learn your juggling, Lou,&rdquo; Zoo said
	coolly. And he didn&rsquo;t have to lie. They did really juggle
	those objects, along with whatever else they were strong enough to
	pick up and toss in the sky, whether it was alive or not..</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Then,
	why does Sue say there&rsquo;s blood on some of them??&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo&rsquo;s
	eyes dart towards his mom whose job was to take tickets and welcome
	the diverse group of guests arriving. She hardly spoke yet
	apparently seemed to be an excellent tattle tell. He always felt
	deep down she knew about his hobbies, but this was the first time
	she&rsquo;d made a move.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Before
	Zoo could answer, Drew started to cry bitterly.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">ENOUGH!
	Your mother told me about that cave. Tell me, do you think it&rsquo;s
	okay to toss animals into the sky and harm them??&rdquo; Lou&rsquo;s
	tone dripped with disgust and anger. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Drew
	started the water works again, as Zoo scowled. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It was
	later that day. The sun was starting set, making the sky a mix of
	purple and orange. The hot temperatures had subsided into a more
	pleasant if humid warmth and the quiet forest area in the middle of
	Donut Plains bustled with activity. Lots of people of all ages,
	species, and financial status came together to see hilarious clowns,
	death defying stunts, and eat lots of popcorn and peanuts inside of
	the massive main tent.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sue
	smiled weakly as guest walked in and handed her the tickets. It had
	been a very rough day, but seeing the bright beaming smiles of those
	who entered the gates warmed her heart. A little koopa wearing a
	balloon hat was brought in by their guardian. Sue could tell they
	weren&rsquo;t from around with their traditional Asian looking garb
	and the fact that their koopa shells were completely black and
	smooth like the surface of a stereotypical bomb.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sue
	wished them a good show. She sincerely did. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Later it
	was the third act and time for the titular &lsquo;Juggling Diddley&rsquo;.
	Lou juggled seventeen items: sharpened knives, flaming torches, even
	a few chainsaws, flinging them high into the sky. No one in the
	audience knew how he could handle each item of different weight and
	feel with so much precision and accuracy. Off where no one paid
	attention, the Diddley brothers sneak in with ease, hiding behind
	barrels.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo,
	a-are you s-sure this is okay??&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	glared at Drew. &ldquo;Just stay here while I ring this bell and
	annoy everyone.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wait!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	sighed and turned around. &ldquo;What?!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Drew
	struggled to find his words. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we just.. forget
	about this? I mean, we could be safer, like, we did almost
	accidentally get ourselves stabbed tossing those knives and live
	fuzzies in the sky. Can&rsquo;t we switch to bowling pins?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	rolled his eyes, thoroughly annoyed. &ldquo;Fine&hellip; After
	tonight.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With
	that, Drew ducked back for cover while Zoo became invisible and went
	near the bottom row where crowds enjoyed the show. He tried to ring
	a small yellow bell that resembled a hologram more than a solid
	object. He had gotten it from lock picking a chest of his father&rsquo;s
	but it wasn&rsquo;t very loud at all, making a dull thud like noise.
	Before he could try anything else, the darkness at the top of the
	tent became a deeper black, then the blackness formed into an oval
	like shape. A chainsaw that Lou was juggling got too close and
	appeared to be sucked in. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It was
	gone, out of their realm. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lou&rsquo;s
	rhythm failed once he got to the missing tool and the audience
	gasped as sixteen items crashed to the ground, the blindfold boo
	narrowly avoiding getting stabbed, burnt, or worse. That was when
	the low bone rattling drone drowned out the crowd. Zoo for the first
	time he recalled felt fear at a deep primal level.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The noise
	grew louder with the screams of hundred being added as random
	objects, trash, thousands of popcorn kernels, balloons and even
	people were sucked up into the black hole. This &lsquo;portal&rsquo;
	seemed to be alive, like something on the other side was choosing
	it&rsquo;s victims. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
	have you done?!&rdquo; Lou screamed, on the brink of madness.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	wouldn&rsquo;t be able to question how his father had found him so
	quickly be his and everyone else's heart stopped when an image of a
	&lsquo;Dark Star&rsquo; descended from the portal...</font></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After
	tossing a few rocks into the lake, Zoo disposed of a pink little
	diary that belonged to a room mate at the Do-Gooder&rsquo;s Boo
	Community (who thought they were too good to be a Ghost House) he
	lived at. He was sixteen and had to clean his room, eat at scheduled
	times, participate peacefully in activities, and resist the urge to
	maul people, but at least it gave him an audience for various
	guessing games he was amazing at, at least until a counselor would
	get on him for &lsquo;gambling&rsquo;. Finally being off the
	antipsychotics helped too, as Zoo hadn't had a blackout in a full
	year. Things were looking up, and when he turned eighteen he could
	finally leave the pit of despair that was Donut Plains forever.
	Before he could return to the mess hall, a big boo wearing a ranger
	hat got all into his face like a drill sergeant. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We&rsquo;re
	gonna have another conduct evaluation next month and I&rsquo;ll be
	watching you closely, Zoo!&rdquo; Boo Master, one of the counselors
	barked.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	nodded. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Good.&rdquo;
	She shoved a broom in his hands. &ldquo;You can eat with the rest
	when you do your chores.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo swept
	for a while, muttering all kinds of things under his breath. Shortly
	after he caught sight of a parent bringing home their son Booligan,
	the last of the couple of trouble causing boos that were mass
	evicted from the community last night. Now Zoo would have much less
	excitement in his life and he&rsquo;d need to find a way to make his
	own &lsquo;fun&rsquo; and fast. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ten
	minutes later Zoo was done and the outside deck of the mess hall
	cabin was spotless aside from some items in the garden that were
	rustling and occasionally dropping their leaves. Going around the
	side of the building to investigate scared away a few goonies, large
	slow flying birds, that were picking at the vegetables. He got an
	idea to reach his arms out and concentrate really hard. This would
	always give him a headache but if he persevered interesting things
	ensued and to his surprise and wonder, like he&rsquo;d shot an arrow
	at it with his mind, the bird closest to him that was trailing
	behind the rest make a little caw in the sky before it plummeted
	below to land in some bushes.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He was
	less ecstatic about that, considering hurting wildlife was exactly
	what would get him shipped away. Making sure no one was looking he
	dashed into the foliage and to his relief the avian was still alive,
	even somewhat viciously flapping and pecking to get far away from
	Zoo to join its flock in the sky.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With that
	two minutes of excitement over, he went back behind where the
	kitchen was to get a preview of the meal for today. Peeking through
	the back door that was never closed, he saw in the kitchen a boiler
	of mushroom stew simmering with a steaming bowl next to it. He guess
	that was the personal portion for their cook, who was busy in the
	corner playing a Gameboy. Zoo always hated that greedy big boo who
	ate half of the pot and then claimed that there wasn&rsquo;t enough
	ingredients for the twenty five at the camp. (Of course, no one
	believed Zoo&rsquo;s accusation.) Worse yet he never shared his
	videogames, so Zoo gathered up some sand to dump the bowl next to
	the stew and went out again to come in from the front. Sample
	that...</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">One
	counselor, an Eerie who wore a beat up hat and sung the most badly
	pitched but catchy campfire songs was doing just that, minus the
	campfire. Zoo took a seat with other young boos just as his song
	&lsquo;Ain&rsquo;t no Flyguys on us&rsquo; finished. Boo Master went
	back into the kitchen for a moment and everyone waited until there
	was a loud gasp from behind the doors. Many Boos swarmed around the
	door to murmur and intrigued, Zoo joined to see&hellip; that this
	was one day the cook boo didn&rsquo;t taste test first. Boo Master
	was sprawled out on the ground gagging right near the pot while
	their cook was panicking in the corner.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	slowly inched back towards the mess hall until the eerie counselor
	called him out.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	where are you going?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It
	was just sand!!&rdquo; On impulse Zoo ran out, sprinting towards the
	fields of Donut Plains for what seemed like forever. Feeling
	paranoia take over, he knew something threatening chased him
	relentlessly. He couldn&rsquo;t see it, but it was always there,
	even if he was in a grassland that was empty for miles around.
	Reaching the apex of a hill, he could see Yoshi&rsquo;s Island
	below. Feeling there was no other option as the forces against him
	closed in, he jumped. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Later
	that night, Zoo was declared to be okay, namely because he never
	jumped off of anything other than a small mole hill and he never
	traveled farther than a quarter of a mile, nor was there any pursuer
	ever. That was how he was put back on the antipsychotics...</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	Diddley brothers crashed onto a bench with a fresh cold Chuckola
	Cola in both hands. After being estranged for fourteen years, last
	year they happened to stumble upon each other around Toad Town and
	hit it off to each of their surprise.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
	would you like to try next? Or ride next, rather?&rdquo; Drew asked,
	all grown up and looking like any other typical toad, except
	apparently this one was about to be &lsquo;president&rsquo;.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo had
	in mind Pinna Park&rsquo;s ferris wheel, and since the sun was down
	and the children would supposedly be passed their bed times, it spun
	twice as fast as a nod to an odd glitch it developed once. Up until
	then, the brothers were riding kiddy rides. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Massive
	fire works went off, drowning out Zoo&rsquo;s reply. They quickly
	found that amusement parks were one thing they could schedule with
	their very different lives and have equal enjoyment from it. Zoo
	lived in Toad Town, independently, kept himself in check mostly, and
	had a new job lined up. In fact-</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Did
	I tell you I&rsquo;m going to move to Dark Land?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	cost of living there is cheap.. Maybe you won&rsquo;t have to borrow
	money from me so much now.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	laughed dryly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see. I&rsquo;ll be working inside
	Bowser&rsquo;s castle. They took my application and I didn&rsquo;t
	even have to use a fake name.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Drew
	turned to Zoo quickly. &ldquo;What exactly will you do?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	shrugged. &ldquo;Menial stuff. I ain&rsquo;t about to join a war and
	get my brains stomp out by any plumbers.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Good.&rdquo;
	Drew turned to the fireworks again. Red, purple and blue lights
	dazzled in the sky. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Even
	through his flat expression watching the light show, Zoo could tell
	that Drew seemed happy, a mere shadow of his disposition as a child
	though there were still the similarities. He always knew Drew would
	grow up to be either a doctor or a complete and utter weirdo, so he
	was glad Drew managed to make both of those things work out somehow.
	Zoo had his own milestones to be proud of. He hadn&rsquo;t killed
	anyone since ever, even though he could with a wave of the hand
	using his special invisible death ray like biomanipulation. Drew&rsquo;s
	easy and unquestioned acceptance of Zoo&rsquo;s abilities were
	another reason the two could get along like they were never
	separated. The only annoying thing was when Drew would bring up
	their aging parents, whom Zoo could care less about, really...</font></p>

	and the other domestic, some temporary, some seasonal, and some made
	up on the spot, because Bowser never really had records of anything.
	As the garbage collector, Zoo was working another dirty morning
	shift when he shoved aside some propaganda posters and saw a yellow
	note from Prince Ludwig Von Koopa. The note was titled:</font></p>
	<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wonderful
	ideas of my own that are slightly not wonderful enough to be
	useful:&rsquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">1. Lure
	Mario to the castle my means of free pasta? No, we must first make
	the pasta and I would never touch the stuff. My family cannot be
	trusted to not burn water. That includes Iggy, who has indeed burnt
	water before in the lab. Scrapped. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">2. Buy
	out the Mushroom Kingdom Art Museum? It is quite drab as confirmed
	by me when I visited it under disguise. If we buy it out we will be
	legally able to occupy the museum with our soldiers and I could
	update the museum&rsquo;s art, music, and history sections and then&hellip;
	That does not get us any closer to destroying Mario does it?
	Scrapped!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">3. Make
	use of the virus samples that are taking up space in the
	refrigerator. Bowser Junior has already almost spread them on his
	toast twice, despite the warning labels on them. We have dino-pox,
	goomba cough, and mushroom flu on standby. Mushroom flu is most
	promising as the strand in our possession has mutated, making the
	current cure as invented by Doctor Mario useless. I suppose we could
	develop the cure and hold it ransom for the princess. No wait, bad
	idea. A cure for a newly mutated virus might take a long period of
	time and our ransom idea would fall apart if denizens perished in
	the process. So it is agreed, this is very scrapped!!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">4.
	Dresses. Yes, we steal the elegant dress garments of the princess
	and-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">GET
	UP.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Everything
	was cloudy, was he in bed? Zoo knew he was, because the covers were
	over his face and the stiff slab like bed was beneath him. He threw
	them off to only see around him the deepest black he&rsquo;d ever
	seen, like a vortex that would suck him in. In the direction that
	used to be the door leading out of the cramped living space was now
	a silhouette with spires stretching infinitely in five directions.
	Had he seen it before? </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	passed Zoo while he spaced out. &ldquo;What is it, underling? You
	are in the way of me disposing of this garbage.&rdquo; Ludwig held
	in his hand a can of soda.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	blinked. He wasn&rsquo;t anywhere near his room, in fact he was half
	way across the castle in an area designated for royalty and high
	ranking soldiers, complete with tiled floors, wall decorations of
	koopa generals, and no sign of mildew anywhere. &ldquo;How did I get
	here?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
	should be the one giving me that information!&rdquo; Ludwig snatched
	a yellow paper out of Zoo&rsquo;s hands. &ldquo;And give me that!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yes
	sir, I guess.&rdquo; Zoo wouldn&rsquo;t know how he&rsquo;d
	sleepwalked or what was the significance of Ludwig&rsquo;s interest
	in his own trash until-</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	floated backward, eyes wide. &ldquo;-No way! I don&rsquo;t know
	anything about that.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mitch had
	the same expression. &ldquo;Well if it wasn&rsquo;t you then&hellip;
	what was that?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	tackled Mitch back down on the pathway. &ldquo;No, what did you do
	to me?!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mitch
	shook his head slowly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a famous guy in Nimbus
	Land who taught me &lsquo;Psychopath&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s what I
	used. Dude, you can&rsquo;t run. I know all about you.&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And
	so.. now what? They send me back to an insane asylum?? I don&rsquo;t
	freaking think so!!!&rdquo; Zoo screamed over him. Right after,
	Mitch felt an all too familiar pressure and heat behind his eyes,
	worse than ever before.</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jelectro
	Bond&rsquo;s Aston Mushroom drove down Pleasant Path and then to
	Koopa Village. It was midnight and they were coming from Mushroom
	Kingdom Hospital East, having to go through all sorts of hurdles to
	get out that very strange situation since many had caught them both
	at the scene. Kylie did her best to protect Bond&rsquo;s identity,
	and the secret agent&rsquo;s plainness helped as well. Kylie was now
	half asleep in the car.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mon
	ami,&rdquo; Bond whispered. He shook Kylie gently as he stopped the
	car in front of her house. &ldquo;Please stay here. I need to check
	out this area..&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	opened one eye once he was gone. &ldquo;As if.&rdquo; She got out
	and took a few drowsy, but cautious steps.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Kylie..
	is that.. you, babe?&quot; a weak voice asked. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Seeing
	almost the exact scene with Nass all over again was like someone
	splashing ice-cold water in her face. The toad lay there bleeding
	but with no apparent injury. She swooped down to hugged him closely.
	&quot;Mitch?! You went up against that psycho Susie, didn't you??
	I&rsquo;m so sorry! I saw him or her and- and-&quot;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Already
	on it,&rdquo; Bond said, standing near. &ldquo;Emergency services
	are on their way. Also you should&hellip; notice this.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond
	picked up Mitch&rsquo;s journal that was tossed aside and Kylie took
	it from him, hardly able to use her normally excellent night vision
	due to her tears. The first page she turned to had one really odd
	sketch that Mitch must have used half of his ink to draw. On the
	next page was &lsquo;Zoo Diddley&rsquo; written in spidery
	lettering. That was it.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond put
	a hand on her shoulder, catching sight of that second page also. &ldquo;I
	am sorry.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">As the
	sound of a siren in the distance became audible, Kylie stood up and
	turned to him. &quot;You&rsquo;re like Mitch and &lsquo;Susie&rsquo;
	or Zoo I mean, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond
	paused. &ldquo;Yes I am.. How did you-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	thought so, I mean, that&rsquo;s the only way it&rsquo;d make sense.
	Mitch never really told anyone about his super powers but me back in
	the day. He was super protective of his own yet he did so many
	projects on it and was always so obsessed with others like him.&rdquo;
	She held his journal to her chest and never opened it up again for
	the rest of the night.</font></p>
