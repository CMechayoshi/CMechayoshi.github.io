Bowser is making mega monsters...in bootleg zone!</strong></p><p><strong>Disclaimer: Mario belongs to Nintendo and the Adventure Books to Archway Paperback. Pokemon to Gamefreak though they had nothing to do with this monstrosity.</strong></p><p><strong>Author note: This original story this is based on follows the several choices in the book but I have remixed it with Pokemon Vietanese Crystal. THIS IS A REMIX OF MY STORY "MONSTER MIX-UP". To understand much of anything you need to read the first chapter of that. I'm not trying to shill my own stories here, you really need to read the original for the jokes to make sense.</strong></p><hr size="1" noshade><p>Mario and his friends were at the 'Elfworld Circus'. A new kind of circus that had just moved into the Mushroom Kingdom. It had a "ELF" museum, a battle area and several other attraction. Mario and friends were currently observing the various freaks being displayed in cages such as a Charizard mixed with a Magikarp.</p><p>"It's nice to see these weirdos in cages for once," Mario said, although he had never seen pokemon this weird. They must be running out of ideas in the new games, he thought as he took a bite of his corn dog. "Well, It's about time we got a day off for fun."</p><p>"Hey, I'm hungry," Luigi complained.</p><p>"Why didn't you get a corn dog like me?"</p><p>"Did you see the nutrition value on those? I'm watching my figure, and besides, rumor has it, they use real LIDEL in this food. What ever that is..."</p><p>Mario gagged a bit. "Momma-mia, maybe I shouldn't be eating this..."</p><p>"Luigi my dear boy! You're as thin as rails! Help yourself. This is vacation!" the Mushroom King spoke up. He was tagging along with the Princess and Toad.</p><p>"I don't know daddy. Luigi has a point. I wouldn't personally eat anything from...whatever this place is supposed to be." Peach agreed.</p><p>"Whatever then, more for me!" Toad shouted, burying his face in a cup of popcorn half the size of him.</p><p>Luigi pouted and looked at his watch. The Pokemon battle wouldn't be showing for another hour.</p><p>"Now what do we do? The the Pokemon museum is anything but amusing.</p><p>"Hey!" Toad yelled as he lifted his head from the popcorn, "Let's have a picture taken in that tent over there."</p><p>"That's not a bad idea, I am wearing one of my new dresses," Peach added.</p><p>They headed to the tent. Outside it, it had a sign:</p><p>"TAKE BACK SHOOTINGS OF ONE WITH WITH RICHES AND FAMOUS"</p><p>No one knew exactly how that was supposed to translate, but they went in anyway. Inside, there was life-sized cardboard cutouts of the King, Peach, and Mario.</p><p>"People are weird," Mario said simply.</p><p>The friends lined up in front of a giant camera. The moment they stood on the "x" spots the camera man shouted-</p><p>"DONTDOSTUPID!" A blinding flash goes off.</p><p>After a few seconds Mario's vision cleared, but something was terribly wrong.</p><hr size="1" noshade><p><strong>To be continued...</strong></p><p><strong>Author note 2: I AM...I AM A MONSTER WRITER.
