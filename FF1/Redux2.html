</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Stunned,
the Lakitu Bro&rsquo;s film kept rolling&hellip;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Remember
what the flyers that brought you here stated. They were going to take
only toads up North. IF YOU ARE NOT A TOAD, YOU ARE NOTHING TO THEM.&rdquo;
Booigi dropped the podium mic to the ground, the thunk of it ringing
over them. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Freeze!
You&rsquo;re under arrest!&rdquo; ordered Snifit Patrol, doing a
stylish barrel roll before the boo. He aimed his taser.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Are
you </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">with</font></em>
<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">them?&rdquo;
Booigi questioned, low and gritty like. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Positively!
I am a sworn justice enforcer for Toad TooOOOOWN!&rdquo; he wailed,
flying in the sky.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Booigi
launched him higher than the clouds with a glowing green tennis
racket. The snufit disappeared with a twinkle that dropped a ball of
chaos on the castle grounds. Spectators trampled over each other down
Royal Raceway and through the lake in the panic to escape, some
crunching on fragmented glistening and steadily melting icy remains
of the King&rsquo;s representative without realizing it. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A whizzing
ball of light missed by a hair, drawing the boo toward the princess&rsquo;s
corner of the property hedges, followed by additional erratic shots
from the lone scared guard. Her backup huddled with her for cover and
unleashed a fury of blasts across Peach&rsquo;s yard, ripping apart
all remaining bushes and trees, scorching and chipping the remains of
the castle, and creating innumerable trenches in the lawn. The boo
went intangible and when they reappeared away from the warzone, and
lower at the sand path, a guard thought it wise to sneak behind them.
Booigi backhandedly bashed his face in with the racket. As he
crumpled backward to the ground, an engine started up to the right, a
crowded battle tank tearing across the lake shore. A red bullet bill
was shot. Booigi had a flash of trepidation before teleporting. Their
beady eyes sparkled with glee upon watching the bullet arc and latch
to the target, them, now standing behind the tank!</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Like it
was suddenly a clown car, a ridiculous amount of guards scurried out,
the last and largest getting stuck halfway out the hatch. As he
begged for help, two seconds away from mince meat, Booigi registered
that square jawed one as one of Saul&rsquo;s aides moments ago&hellip;
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
explosion rocked the area a second time. Those that had managed to
get miles away could spot the black plume on the horizon. As debris
and smoldering shrapnel from the tank and explosives rain, a boo
diddly reappeared at lake shore opposite of the castle. Booigi
dropped Benedict onto his back.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
saved you this time, but your league will blame. Torture. And kill
you,&rdquo; Booigi whispered matter of factly, raising afterwards and
vanishing totally from the property. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Benedict
remained sprawled on the mud and clay, paralyzed. He watched his
comrade&rsquo;s boots move in and out of the scope of his vision, in
search for the killer and barking into their radios. Familiar hands
of someone yanked him to his feet. He received a clear picture of
Jon, panting and scowling. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ben
you idiot. I saw you way from across the lake and I had to leave the
castle brats behind to get over here. You messed up!!!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ben
nodded, pressing something into his squadron mate's hand. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ignoring
the other guard steadily jotting the incident down to his side, Jon
speechlessly watched Ben stumble towards the lake again, continuing
in the blue waters until it reached to his knees, then thigh, waist,
shoulders, head&hellip; When bubbles rose from a spot, Jon opened his
sweaty palm. Ben&rsquo;s nickel dog tag was in it. </font>
</p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A group of
young people of various sizes and shapes gawked.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Raven!
Jim! It&rsquo;s not like that!&rdquo; Wendy shouted in between her
butterfly strokes toward the pontoon.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Gosh
Wendy.. You got us shook..&rdquo; The goomba girl jumped back when
the koopaling princess climbed aboard. Astonishment faded away and a
glare swept across her punk rebellious features, the dudette sporting
spiky purple hair and gold facial piercings. &ldquo;You knew what
your father was doing, so don&rsquo;t try to cry to us now!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His
ploy to drive people like us out of our homes and into his clutches
has fallen flat!&rdquo; added her boyfriend Jim, a boomerang bro in a
trench coat and white trilby. This roused the other adolescents to
murmur in favor. &ldquo;What cha got to say to us now?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
princess wrung the water from her strands of hair beneath the mask
flag embroidered with her own hammer bro hammer and blue winged anvil
symbol of the Adolescent Anti-Monarchy Faction. She&rsquo;d founded
and was a nuisance with such during a &lsquo;phase&rsquo; back in
eighth grade, before, as many her age did, flip-flopping back to
proud princess land. The seventeen year old was sheepishly
remembering she might have neglected some friends in the process.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So
I&rsquo;ll spill the tea. Yeah, I&rsquo;ve been trying to rise rank
in Daddy&rsquo;s oppressive forces but.. This changes everything!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The punk
goomba girl&rsquo;s lip continued to curl. &ldquo;You cereal?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Uh,
yas?? I wish the ocean was mine, but it&rsquo;s not so we&rsquo;re
technically all equal now in this Kingdom. It&rsquo;s totes gonna be
great here. Dad want&rsquo;s only like, one fortress and it&rsquo;ll
be different, especially if I become his general. I&rsquo;m cereal.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Under
deafening silence, Wendy&rsquo;s blue eyes breezed over everyone in
the boat, the familiars and the not, awaiting their response with
bated breath.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">King
Bowser, stuffed in the bridge, was getting feisty. &ldquo;Get us to
the tower already, Johnson!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Aye
aye, King Bowser!&rdquo; The cadet&rsquo;s jaw clenched. His muscles
burned trying to keep the ship on course, more akin to a rubber
cataquack in a circling drain. It would be worse, the green koopa
troopa kept reminding himself. He was against all odds still alive as
a lowly navigator, the type not even deemed good enough at fighting
to be placed in the early levels, and one of only one thousand
officially tallied before the flood swept them away. He&rsquo;d dare
not say it, but it was all Kammy&rsquo;s fault!</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bang!</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yowch!!
Grrr&hellip; Look where you&rsquo;re going!!!&rdquo; Bowser roared
after they crashed into the tower, pelting the small crew with
bricks.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The Koopa
King shook off the masonry and ordered evacuation to the exposed
floor. It was dark and musty inside with web filled corridors,
mousers, and rusted chains ominously piled around. Bowser froze
before the hole they&rsquo;d made, looking out into the water. His
daughter remained on the pontoon arguing with those kids, some of
whom were holding flaming molotovs. The commotion held that group up
enough that other Koopa Troop overtook them. Minions began to block
Bowser&rsquo;s view as they abandoned ship and scuttled rapidly to
safety, stepping over his toes.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">People
come back!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yes
my son,&rdquo; answered Kamek. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
gotta save my daughter from those losers!!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
magikoopa conjured up an iron three block high Bill Blaster. &ldquo;Lord
Bowser, should a ship attempt to antagonize, the troop is preparing
weapons on the upper floors. We can pierce her soft walls, send smoke
up her aft, and leave her sinking and hopeless!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wow
grandpa really hates whatever girl he&rsquo;s talking about&rsquo;,
Bowser Junior thought, otherwise bored with the adult conversation
already. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Junior
wandered away, shimmying past Ludwig hustling down the damp steps
against the flow of the rest of the troop. &ldquo;Vater&hellip;I&rsquo;m..
ready to resume command.. Is my.. Dear.. sister.. still in peril?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
approvingly nodded him over. &ldquo;Not anymore now that you&rsquo;re
here.. Ready, aim.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
emerged from the corridor a second later, winded as if he&rsquo;d
been unsuccessfully chasing someone on foot. He brushed aside
whatever his problem was joined in. Shooting stuff was fun after
all.. Ludwig with his brother&rsquo;s assistance slid the cannon
about twenty degrees to aim at the boat with the rebels and the
precious koopaling hostage a quarter of a nautical mile away. Bowser
stretched his dominant arm out pointing, the signal for-</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">DADDY!&rdquo;
Wendy shouted through a megaphone. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all totes cool
now.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-FIRE-
wha huh?.. What?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The newly
christened Bowser Tower had a constant rumble from the collective
movements of minions zipping to and fro somewhere on its fifty
floors. The flood rising above ground level, scavenged items from the
ships were sorted through the docking station, technically that
breach they&rsquo;d created before, except with hazard lights tacked
on. Others were furnishing rooms with amenities, repairing things,
establishing quarters, etcetera. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">..Yes
daddy, they&rsquo;ve told all of their five million online friends
about how great you are gave you five stars on Welp dot com.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
checked his slowly loading reviews on his dumbphone. His heart
skipped a beat, not at &lsquo;Bowser Castle 444 Dark Drive&rsquo;
bumping from 1.5 to 4.7 stars in the past hour, rather because Mario
had blown his phone up more severely than he would when they had a
golfing match that didn&rsquo;t go his way or lost in an eating
contest. He quickly hid the screen against his plastron, flushing.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daddy
yaaaas!&rdquo; Wendy sqeed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m excited too. They are
gonna vote for me for governor of Neo Bowser City, which they can
totes do even if we&rsquo;re not in Dark Land.&rdquo; Her entire
little crowd smiled and waved from off to the side.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Huh?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Monday
daddy.. Oh my gosh.. You&rsquo;re so silly!&rdquo; she giggled.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
considered for a little moment if that's what Ludwig was so anxious
over. What, had he admitted discontentment with Mayor Koton at some
point? Or was that Mario? Yeah, seemed like something he'd vent to
him rather. Bowser cleared his throat, catching heat on his face
again.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-That&rsquo;s
clever girl, but I can't tolerate vote solicitation... SEND THEM TO
OUR NEW DUNGEON!&rdquo; Bowser ordered. Immediately soldiers scooped
Wendy&rsquo;s friends away. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
distaff koopaling dropped to the ground kicking and screaming and
bawling, &ldquo;Daddy noooooo!! What do you even care? You said you
were removing your name from that place anyway because it has little
to do with you anymooooooore!!!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He covered
his ears. &ldquo;&hellip;HEY! Babydoll. Whadda make you stop??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Weeeell,&rdquo;
she began, propped up on one elbow. &ldquo;I wanna help with KT
stuff. Make a change, ya know. Better to do something sooner than
later. Make me.. Lieutenant!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Simultaneously
Ludwig and Thwomp #3, one of several minions eavesdropping while they
were supposed to be working, randomly choked on something in the
background.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Annoyed,
Bowser stomped hard, &ldquo;THIS IS FAMILY BUSINESS!!!&rdquo; The
rattled nonrelatives filed out. &ldquo;Now, I need this drama over
before our official discourse in five minutes. What are we gonna do?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The blue
haired koopaling had tucked into his shell partially, only his messy
hair and busy eyebrows showing, which promptly furrowed. &ldquo;Nevermind
this. I am shielding everyone from my newly obtained contagion and I
absolutely cannot accept-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wendy
sniffled very loud, lip wavering. The commander&rsquo;s mind raced,
weighing one unfavorable option with another..</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Any
substitutions besides my dear sister Wendy O...&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">An
ingrained habit, Peach felt the span of her holding space, her
ungloved fingers, she&rsquo;d lost them in the flood, gliding over
jagged bricks. By estimate it was half the size of that gaudy waiting
room at Bowser&rsquo;s Castle. Somberly she slid down to the floor,
facing the other occupant. Wonderful. Already downgrading. Maybe not
entirely if that mustached person was awake. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Are
you still cold dear?&rdquo; She&rsquo;d hugged him before and
received a stabbing chill in return. He&rsquo;d shrunk from her touch
since. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hm!&rdquo;
Toadsworth broke out of meditation and wrapped his arms around
himself in an exaggerated fashion. &ldquo;Brrrr, just a bit princess.
I did erm, explain did I? I&rsquo;ll manage&hellip; Will you ever
detail that.. &lsquo;Pillar of Understanding&rsquo; you encountered?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It worked
the mushroom up so much at first mention, it seemed like unwise
discourse if he felt lousy. &ldquo;It is underwater now anyway. Why
are you convinced it&rsquo;s supernatural?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Because&hellip;
Did you touch it, Princess??&rsquo;&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
cannot recall.. I strolled close and had a daydream,&rdquo; she
mentioned offhandedly. &ldquo;When I came to, I decided we should
rejoin Bowser, and it was wise. Now rest. Please! He has dozens of
ships at the ready, and we&rsquo;ll be on one of them sailing away
any moment.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadsworth
hoped so. He didn&rsquo;t know if it was the deleterious effects of
the Gravitational Pull or not, but something was wrong with his body.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
huffed and marched away into the cramped stairwell. It was complete
poo and soooo out of left field that Wendy had coveted his position
all along. If Ludwig really thought she could abet him better, so be
it. To march to his &lsquo;room&rsquo; he had to climb to the 49th
floor which would be the koopaling&rsquo;s eventually. It currently
housed one mattress they&rsquo;d reclaimed, Roy&rsquo;s, so he was in
fact lounging on it and no one but him was gonna touch that thang..</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Get
outta my face, Mort!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
stopped and peeped around one of many columns in the dusty room. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
am thinking about your downfall. Your doom. Your undoing.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">My
freakin what?&rdquo; Larry shuddered. &ldquo;Shut yo fat face! I
don&rsquo;t care what that creepy Sentry dug up on me. Why would I
work with Peach? I was just.. tryin&rsquo; ta score!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">While the
koopalings collectively fell short of a perfect record against pesky
plumbers, Larry principally had the worse win rate, outright
forfeiting his World 1 fortress during the last pre-Peace Pact KT
siege. He retreated from the others since and like the Iggy bullying
problem, Lemmy feared he&rsquo;d taken notice of this too late..</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Morton
lazily leaned against some of the family stacked chests. &ldquo;That
is a more acceptable, textbook explanation I admit, however you said
some &lsquo;problematic&rsquo; things in that letter as our sister
put it. Do you really wish to those stars on occasion or
happenstance, about renouncing princehood and starting over in that
Mushroom Kingdom??&rdquo; He snorted. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry&rsquo;s
punches did little with his brother's thick scales. &ldquo;Ahhhhhg!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
stepped out. &ldquo;Stoooop!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
was only grilling this lameo traitor!&rdquo; the sixteen year old
retorted.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
inserted himself between them, which was gutsy in hindsight when they
were taller and stronger than him. He continued with resolve,
&ldquo;Mushroom folks are just people and there&rsquo;s nothing wrong
with wanting a job outside of Dad&rsquo;s army either!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That got
the tanned koopaling to straighten up and wipe away those smug looks.
Lemmy wasn&rsquo;t expecting Larry to do anything too sappy other
than grunt some form of thank you, but he didn&rsquo;t even get that.
The blue haired teenager brushed past him hard enough to make him
lose balance. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;m
sure you wouldn't have bothered if you still had somethin&rsquo; to
lose,&rdquo; Larry hissed, leaving Morton bewildered and Lemmy hating
he&rsquo;d made that impression with the timing of it all. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
strove to hunt him down again. Was he up or down? He tried up, the
rooftop seemed like an obvious brood spot. Instead he came upon
someone standing rigidly straight, unaffected by the light patter of
rain. A backpack with a mechanical purr was strapped to the lanky
koopaling, with an invention to &lsquo;solve&rsquo; his memory lapse.
The amalgamation of his VR headset, parts from the coin operated
binocular station with digital zoom, and his cell phone, created a
twisted bunch of exposed circuits and wires sprouting from his
forehead, redolent of a sci-fi movie. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-I
have assimilated all idiosyncrasies of the being: Ignatius H Koopa.
Status at 70 percent of memories. Currently archiving footage of
first Koopa Ball try out. The one that birthed the embarrassing
nickname of &lsquo;Icky Iggy&rsquo; in High School. Awaiting further
command.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Forgetting
what he was doing, Lemmy stared at the incidental patterns in the
glossy stone tile. &ldquo;Our sister kinda stole that privilege from
me?..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">OMG?!&rdquo;
Ignatius Delta gasped. The cyborg&rsquo;s shoulders rolled, some life
seeping in. &ldquo;Hey, again. I just Alt Controlled so this really
is me. Yikes, what happened?? Well no time, sorry. While that stuff
is processing or whatever I&rsquo;m just gonna check up on Sam and
Slam all the way at Isle Delfino with my rocket attachment. You did
say I should stand up to them. With these cybernetic enhancements, I
now can!! Laters.&quot;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy!&rdquo;
</font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Here&rsquo;s
a decoy in the meantime. Don't worry, I will totally return to avenge
you and defeat the 'Wendy Menace'. Up up and away!!!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy was
blasted with smoke of Iggy Delta&rsquo;s pack rocking him off into
the stratosphere. Coughing and fanning, he bumped into a projector on
the ground. It created a life-sized hologram, photorealistic of Iggy
standing and cheesing goofily. Lemmy snapped towards his watch. He
forgot to scribble on a new minute hand. He picked it up and
backtracked to the 50th floor. He was late. His dad and the others,
even Princess Peach were waiting. Bowser sat on his salvaged red and
gold plush throne, only dried out a few moments ago by diligent
minions with hair dryers- who managed to make it work without
electricity. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Alright,
do I gotta recap? We all know a freak incident last night tore my
castle up and scattered us around then we were washed here. Lost
anybody? Now.. oh great for Lemmy and Iggy to show. How were you two
and Ludwig knocked into another Kingdom? Y&rsquo;all didn&rsquo;t
sneak out or nuthin last night, right?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
commander of the Koopa Troop, sustaining that awkward half tuck,
shifted slightly. &ldquo;..Only to Neo Bowser City. I was restless
and saw fit to make sure my brothers were safe while purchasing their
video-game. Then- of course we were struck by calamity like all
else!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A portion
of Lemmy&rsquo;s pent up frustration fizzled away, relieved Ludwig
did not view such admission ignominious for his stature. It was only
too bad the unsaid portion was &lsquo;crazy as a cracker&rsquo;,
involving sleepwalking, Zoo Diddley, and an evil ancient artifact..</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
shrugged. &ldquo;Fine.. So, the purpose of this is that.. I declare
that we stay in Sky Land and rebuild here!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Five
seconds later: &ldquo;WHAT????&rdquo; Thunder boomed and all the
candles went out, the smoke from such whisked back and forth as
Bowser&rsquo;s repeated orders to shut up clashed against the
counter-arguments involving every little thing&hellip;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Two hours
later: &ldquo;YES! I&rsquo;ve explained a million times. I KNOW we
have our heritage and junk in Dark Land. THIS DOESN&rsquo;T CHANGE
THAT!!! I want to have my castle HERE. Okay? Not where the old one
is, not closer to Neo Bowser City where the shopping centers are, and
not where it&rsquo;s hot and tropical all the time.. Wendy.. We&rsquo;re
gonna conquer this joint as Property of Bowser starting today and&hellip;
We re-kidnap Peach!!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A big
cheer reverberated through the tower. Candles relit.. somehow, the
sun came out, and birds sang outside.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
desperately broke out of the group and tumbled at Bowser&rsquo;s
feet. &ldquo;This is against our agreement! You&rsquo;ve made my
people sick! How can you prolong this game??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
rose, the light behind him from the window creating a menacing jagged
silhouette. &ldquo;Bwa ha ha ha ha ha ha!!! Because it&rsquo;ll lure
Mario and I want him to see me somewhere different for once!!&rdquo;
Looking less cool all of a sudden, he zoned out.. &ldquo;Meeting
over. Everybody scram!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wendy
immediately huddled up to her older brother. &ldquo;Alright, let&rsquo;s
do this general thing!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
shall see,&rdquo; Ludwig replied, unenthused. &ldquo;Your desire to
control the city is dazzling is all.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
think not, nerd. It&rsquo;s baby steps. In fact I thought that was
why you wanted that Villain Badge so much!&rdquo; When she teased
that, she poked him, making one of his exceptionally dry scutes flake
off. She hardly noticed, but Ludwig dreadfully did. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Watching
himself fall apart shocked some of his old habits back. Eldstar
forgive him, he was about to get selfish again. &ldquo;Sister mine,
yes, the badge is fresh in mind and so, lend your ear&hellip;&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Shortly,
Wendy veered away from him, beaming. &ldquo;Luddy, you are the best!&rdquo;
she exclaimed, a rare statement indeed. </font>
</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
paused before a smallish triangular window and watched the land. The
waters receded from higher elevations, revealing green peaks and even
an important looking white pillar or obelisk in the distance&hellip;In
solitude, in 'safety' of sorts, Bowser identified the persistent knot
in him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
couldn't talk to Mario now, and it bothered him. Was it </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">separation?
Anxiety</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">?
Yeah, he'd officially gone too far to back down now. In some
alternate universe he'd just left Peach where she was and a few days
from now it would have blown over. They could finally do that laser
tag thing. Somewhere in his shell there might have been crumpled
reservations under the pseudonym 'FF'. He forgot what it was supposed
to mean, 'Frenemies something?' or was it 'Forever something?'</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Then a
huge thump rippled through the tower, hard enough to jostle what
little decoration he&rsquo;d done for the spot adjacent to his
throne. His copy of &lsquo;Pride and Prejudice&rsquo;, a giant old
map, and a part of the lapis bust of his brother, were flung off, the
bust rolling and spinning across the floor. It was the one object
Bowser bothered to chase down. He picked it up and peered into his
brother&rsquo;s near identical face mug, only differently colored.
The castle destruction had reduced it to the shoulder up, and that
little incident just now chipped a horn. The further damage highly
irritated Bowser. His brother looming around in spirit had been a
constant since he began to reign in castles- and that was a long time
ago! </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A minion
stood at the passage in with a letter.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
jerked it away from the koopatrol. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...What???&rdquo;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~Anything
she wants! Anything she wants! I&rsquo;ll give you the key! Anything
you need! What she says you know I&rsquo;ll do, that&rsquo;s my gift
to you!</font></em> 
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
scandalous for its day track on the B side, &ldquo;Shackled&rdquo; by
The Pizzas fades out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette&rsquo;s
finger jutted out for that double backward arrow button.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After a
short journey overall, the duo reached Pleasant Path, an area of Toad
Town with the highest property value second to Royal Raceway, likely
due to the Mario brother&rsquo;s proximity and historical
significance, the first location where &lsquo;enemy species&rsquo;
submitted to Mushroom rule. There was a fortress a mile away, a
tourist attraction in the summer.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
really love that tune, eh? It&rsquo;s alright I guess, haha...&rdquo;
Bridget trailed off in melancholy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
smiled nervously holding the button, praying the tired cassette
didn&rsquo;t give out. Had it been born in a different format, it&rsquo;d
be considered so successful with its billion plays. Instead it was an
out of print dad mushroom rock thing, introduced to her through her
boyfriend Bucken-Berry, who got it from his surrogate &lsquo;father&rsquo;
of sorts Mario. Disappointingly the trip was over before Toadette&rsquo;s
plan came to fruition. They parked at a more modest but presentable
enough for the neighborhood flat. Startlingly the Mario brother&rsquo;s
unoccupied home was three houses away..</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sup,
baby,&rdquo; greeted the pink boo floating in the mildly overgrown
yard, gently assisting by hand the driver out of the car. He was
steely-eyed and approaching middle-aged with patches of gray in this
beard stubble. &ldquo;Thought you were joking when you said you could
see some of us today! Sorry for doubting ya, hehe.&rdquo; They shared
a brief but passionate, veering on inappropriately so, kiss.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It became
apparent to the Toadette, whom Bridget excused away as just being
'some city girl with directions', that these folks weren't other
guards, rather actual friends and, erm, more. The other two were a
goomba with a jade beanie and a bouncy fuzzy with an electronic pipe-
or vape thing.. Toadette was simultaneously realizing that she didn't
get out much. Otherwise, where did that jolt come from, see the
King's guard associating with these folks? It was true then. It was
just a job to most toads!</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
can&rsquo;t hang for long. My, uh, supervisor&rsquo;s wantin&rsquo;
me to travel real far, like where you work at Poshley Heights...&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bridget
detached from the extended hug, ruefully. &ldquo;Oh.. what the heck
Trev? You disappear a lot and not in a boo way. I&rsquo;m starting to
think you&rsquo;re a secret agent.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He laughed
it off. &ldquo;Cool fan-fiction. You know I&rsquo;m just a cabbie. To
make this up, G-Man over there, show her.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The shady
looking goomba unlatched a guitar shaped hard case. Bridget ogled the
single cut, maple flame burst, dual humbucker instrument with.. Les
of Peach&rsquo;s Castle signature in gold at the headstock. Toadette
quickly hid her near matching expression, assuming until then that
Lester P Toad embellished old tales of artist endorsement deals.. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">SWEET!
You know I&rsquo;m guitarded but I like it Trev, Goomfrey, and Obed.&rdquo;
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">During
idle chat, a bandit slithered on the scene and tried to touch the
expensive gift. Bridget whipped around and vaporized him on the spot
with a zapper. Just. Like. That.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A rasp of
&ldquo;Bridge?&rdquo; caught Toadette&rsquo;s attention before the
color returned to her. Obed continued, &ldquo;Yo, you show em! You
don&rsquo;t hafta go back to babysitting, right? Meork..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The guard
lifted the weighty case. &ldquo;Nah, the castle toads all went to the
public address.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Every
last one of them self-righteous bastards?&rdquo; Goomfrey spoke up.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">..S-sure..
Thanks for letting us meet at your brother&rsquo;s front lawn. It&rsquo;s
outta the way like we needed!&rdquo; Bridget went, seemingly to
divert. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
blushed, guilty she was trying to brainwash the guard. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Funny
you mention my goodie-two shoes brother paying a two-thousand coin
rent just so he can be one of the &lsquo;good&rsquo; ones on this
prissy side of town-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Get
on with it!&rdquo; Trevor cut in.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Cause
he just texted me. He was at that public address thang, like way in
the back tho, and next he knew folks started runnin&rsquo; wild and
nearly stomped em..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">On cue,
Bridget&rsquo;s radio beeped. &ldquo;... Copy.&rdquo; She paled,
clicking off.. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s bounce.&rdquo; At her word, the
three friends scattered in opposite directions like troublemakers at
the sound of a siren. Bridget slung the guitar into the B-Dasher
backseat, looking at Toadette. &ldquo;So, like, this was cool of you
to help me, eh. Thanks.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You&rsquo;re
welcome, and no. No problem at all.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Working
with so many strangers was risky but enjoyable to Toadette as the
guard sped up and down the streets on patrol. She gave a start when
they crossed by a certain silver ex-fast food joint.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Could
I pick something up at the Snifit Patrol precinct over there?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Quickly,
but, Yeah.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">By the
time they crossed traffic and pulled up, Sergeant Howie was waddling
across the lot, heavy keys swinging at his waist.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
jumped out, not even using the door. &ldquo;Officer! I work for the
princess and-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Com&rsquo;on!
I need to roll out..&rdquo; The grumbling whomp grant her inside the
cramped cluttered office, furnishings well worn, with a pizza crust
hanging out a trash can that dazed her for a second. She recovered
and pointed to the Princess&rsquo;s parcel in the evidence cubby. At
the last moment she remembered what Bucken-Berry wanted, lingering
before a garbage bag wrapped and marked &lsquo;Zoo S. Diddley&rsquo;.
</font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
one&rsquo;s not even wanted anymore.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With
Zoo&rsquo;s astronomical murder charges??&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
executed in an &lsquo;incarnate&rsquo; way. Dunno what that means,
it&rsquo;s in Snifit Patrol and Douglas&rsquo;s notes. That made
conclusively nailing the punk harder. Besides, they were just Bowser
freaks. Even the bus driver was an ex-one.. Why ya care?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She tried
to ignore that brazen view and flashed her cute smile. &ldquo;I need
it. It contains artwork that he.. Well stole from-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Just
take it all. I&rsquo;m late!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
was pushed out of the station and the officer squeezed into his
shuttle vehicle, the one she once rode yesterday and sped away. She
returned to the B-Dasher, bobbing along to the music as they pulled
off I a better mood.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Are
they real cops?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;We've
always played along and let them enforce Toad Town since...&quot; the
pink toad explained. It felt pretty good in fact to have a fresh ear
around, and not get called a nerd, or walked away from, or an egg
tossed at her- depending on which castle staff she annoyed.. &quot;..
We've only had named streets for forty-four years at this point, and
thanks to the officers the general public has bothered to learn
them.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;To
dodge the radars?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;How'd
you extrapolate?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Got
cited.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
rolled her eyes playfully. &quot;How's it up North?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;They
trot around all day with a parasol or their purebred poochy, eh...
Yeah, my mate doesn't like me in town, but I wish I lived here.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Here?&quot;
she giggled. &quot;My.. 'mate' was against ME moving to a more
aristocratic district.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Lol,
don't. I had more action fighting off my sisters to avoid the draft
than once I was in camp, except for this one time I caught the King
crying about his daughter. Not allowed ta speculate too much on that,
eh.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;He
moved there and our princess took over at fourteen, and she doesn't
discuss that either... &quot; Welp, she better change that subject..
&quot;Where are we going?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bridget's
smile dropped. &quot;I didn't want to work you up. Our rep was just
murdered by a Mushroomite with a tennis racket and a freeze gun.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
settled back, shivering in her seat. Anyone walking around, and there
was an increase lately, could be a new killer. &quot;Bridget, the
Mario brothers should hear about this. They're just across the South
border. Don't you like Mr. Toad? In serendipity he's there too.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Toadette,
that's sounds brilliant but my orders and the fact that toads
rattling cages rarely works out and some of my friends here could get
roped up in it and..&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She drove
for a bit, visibly conflicted in a way that had Toadette on edge- the
guard was well aware of the axioms of life and the repercussions of
dismissing them, but also was oddly adorable.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Alright.
I'm already bending the bloody rules.&quot; The guard veered them
hard left and down a major road, speeding, about to incur perhaps
another infraction as they bolted towards rural land.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">For once
the goodie pink toad was a rebel with her. She didn't know how to
thank her besides muttering such choppily.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bridget
looked at her and then back. &quot;Dude, you okay? Always like that,
eh?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Servitude
is my specialty and I am eager to please.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Huh?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
jabbed the pause button and breathed out. How did she drown out that
cheesy 80s 'seductive' rock music, unless.. that other girl wasn't so
cool in a muscle car (and had a license), and a musician
(purportedly), tough, older than her, and with dark spots like she
liked, plus Bridget like thed color pink in return...</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
snapped out of it, -thankfully- city shrinking in the distance, cacti
lining the roads, sandy air hitting her face. &quot;Sorry for
whatever that was. Thank you for this.&quot; She absently leaned over
and kissed the guard on the cheek.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Dude..&quot;
she said huskily, blushed.</font></p>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Psst,&rdquo;
the noki gestured over to the guy at the other end, hanging outside
the Mushroom Flu patient room. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...Yeah,

Beach.. Yes I know communication is slow, but I saw the breaking news
about what happened there. Don&rsquo;t be that way, Charles. I&rsquo;m
not supposed to even contact you while on leave...&rdquo; The orange
yoshi kept his chin down, tensed. His suit coat was under his arm,
what he&rsquo;d worn it until the temperatures of the South got to
him. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Laki
continued, stooping behind his medical cart. &quot;...I think that
guy was in the YoshiMobile commercial years ago. He switched to
promoting IslandMobile with my second cousin thrice removed. They
bought a Festive Tree together in the competitor's version. Super
progressive for its time, cept the part where supposedly the director
went. 'I have no problem with a yoshi and noki couple, but the French
part has ta go! Hehe.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jr. Troopa
scratched his head. &ldquo;The &lsquo;Can you hear me now?&rsquo;
hipster guy? &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re trippin and that&rsquo;s not
him. You think all yoshi&rsquo;s look alike?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No!&rdquo;

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Just
come with me to Vick&rsquo;s then. You can gossip &lsquo;bout
Mecha-Yoshis instead. Those Macho Outlaws busted in I told ya. Also
Bob the librarian missed an appointment so we might wanna check that.
Get to it, newb.&rdquo; Troopa elbowed him, ribbing the older
recently hired nurse. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">When a
sizable crew filled the hallway moments later, that Yoshi stranger
was nowhere to be found.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Momma-Mia..
just in time.&rdquo; Mario held the rails to Toad&rsquo;s bed,
grimacing. Also in the room was a yoshi, a doogan, and a koopa,
though coming in, they were aware that Toad would get the single
antidote prepared. He was the only one with a &lsquo;may resuscitate
with highly experimental and dangerous medicine&rdquo; in his
records. He also had the most dire vitals being the oldest at
fifty-three. (Even Dr. Toadley&rsquo;s head spun at the revelation of
Toad and Toadsworth being only seven years apart.) Dr. Toadley
propped himself abreast of the red plumber, one eyebrow arching. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Am
I reconsidering this procedure? Yes I am.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Everyone
shared a collective groan. Luigi detected a subtle shift in the
purple toad doctor. Training intently on the unwell tomboy princess,
he began to respect their caution. It struck him that, unlike his
friend in the red-spotted cap, he could only hazard her general
health. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
was forced to find his voice, twisting away from charts on the wall.
&ldquo;Doctor, elucidate please! I reverse engineered that virus
sample myself.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Topper
folded his arms with disappointment. &ldquo;Drew, that&rsquo;s not
the explanation you shared before. That&rsquo;s going to potentially
overstimulate his immune system. Our deciding factor in helping you
here was your abstinence from stunts like that.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
am aware, John!&rdquo; he replied exasperatedly. &ldquo;If Morris has
not arrived and doesn&rsquo;t believe in cellular phones for us to
verify his location, and we&rsquo;re burning our borrowed time here,
is this unjustified? I think not. For science.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario&rsquo;s
gaze darted between Special World doctors with suspicion. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know or care who&rsquo;s who with these proper names all
a sudden, but should we do this or not?&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr.
Toadley put his foot down. &ldquo;Can we give the sole cure to Mr.
Toad? I cannot say I am convinced.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bucken-Berry&rsquo;s
ears perked, seated in the darkest corner the entire time,
maintaining a sort of barrier between him and Mr. Toad continuing to
get every privilege ever, and Dr. Toad, conjecturally Zoo&rsquo;s
secret brother.. Now it seemed Mr. Toad might be hopeless and that
doctor in hot water, for reasons not completely their fault. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He stood.
&ldquo;Guys.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
arguments stopped and seven pairs of eyes stared through him, making
him feel like the biggest bluest idiot in that moment. He persisted,
Mario&rsquo;s question back at the park about wanting to be a hero or
not echoing in his skull. And not because it was empty. He hoped. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Doing
that &lsquo;immunization&rsquo;,&rdquo; he sounded out carefully,
&ldquo;trick on Mr. Toad can work. They did it for me once.. I was
only eight and the week before my hometown was shroob invaded, and I
was recovering from the Goombapox. I was told by this human doctor
guy that lived in the forest alone and had glasses, whoever that was,
and that&rsquo;s why I survived the vim draining. My immune system
was still hiked up over that..&rdquo; Their blank expressions back
ticked him off. &ldquo;Did I share this for nothing?!? It has
velocity!!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...You
mean validity, sir,&rdquo; Thomas corrected.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
strangled him. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">While that
was going on Luigi began to think. &ldquo;...Prof. E Gadd. As much as
he wrote things down, he told me he could never publish his work for
a weird reason.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ah,
ha. I knew I learned from someone!&rdquo; Dr. Toad obscured his blush
from such an outburst with a clipboard, murmuring next, &ldquo;Thank
you blue toad nurse. -And you are indeed more handsome without the
mask, even as you brutalize that guy over there!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Accusers
Mario and Dr. Topper backed off, confused about Dr. Toad&rsquo;s
connection to a professor specializing in boos and, well, that other
part.. They let it go when Dr. Toadley nodded sagely, satisfied with
the turn of events. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
purple-clad doctor slipped up his long sleeves and rose his arms,
from which a clear star with three more stars inside hovered from his
fingertips. The energy gravitated to and dissipated over Toad&rsquo;s
body with brilliant gleam that lit the room, and blew them all back
but Dr. Toad, awestruck and recording observations until Dr. Topper
yanked him back by the coat. There was an additional, gentler floosh
in the room that flapped everyone&rsquo;s clothing as the light went
out, punctuated Toad&rsquo;s monitors firing up with activity.
Everyone eagerly waited around his bed.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Is
it an accelerated process? Yes it is.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
has a 200 BPM heart rate,&rdquo; Toadley&rsquo;s intern added.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-A
very accelerated process.&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad&rsquo;s
eyes cracked open, watery, but with an unmissable spark behind them.
&quot;Did Daze and I win?.. Ha ha..&rdquo; His soft raspy laugh
draped the room in solace. &ldquo;Guess who&rsquo;s back?&quot; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
wiped some of his sweat away with a cloth. His best friend was..
back.. &quot;You, of course!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;The
people's electoral vote this Monday in 48 of 52 participating
kingdoms, homeboy.. &quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Ah&hellip;What?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Can.&quot;
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
promptly gave Toad space as he vomited toxins into a bucket.
Dissonantly there was a hullabaloo from spectators through the window
and door haphazardly left wide open. Jr. Troopa, reeking of motor oil
and clothing burnt black, burst in, the foremost of those abuzz that
Mr. Toad Kinopio Toad, Earl of Mushroom Kingdom was now on the road
to recovery. For everyone&rsquo;s sanity he was relocated into a
private space to recuperate&hellip;</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Twenty
minutes later, the door crept open. This room outside the main
building was homely, wood paneling, metal spinning fan, a cowhide
rug.. TV wouldn't stop broadcasting some situation oceans away. His
patched up, broken and repaired twice, phone slipped from his hand,
too weak to speak anymore. Kinopio-Kun was predictably a sycophant,
but didn't know where his staff was, not the thing to hear when there
was a new killer in town! Worse yet, Toad understood that no one else
could be cured or even close without a missing doctor. On his belly
lay a face magazine he written only a few lines on it. Outlandish
stuff, artificially elevated because he happened to be who he was.
Life wasn't very fair like that..</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
visitors, hand in hand sauntered close enough for him to decipher
with his hazy vision.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Toadette,
and.. So, you're cutting out on Cool Blue now or-?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The pink
toad stumbled against the side of his bed, covering her mouth. &quot;Mr.
Toad, oh my gosh they were able to help you! And no, Bridget and I &hellip;
I thought I was cleverly hitching a ride here. It's complicated.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Seriously?
You're a serial vexen?&quot; the guard accused.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Slowly
Toad leaned upwards, handing the magazine over to Bridget. &quot;Give
that to your squad, will you? From: Mr. Toad. It's important.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bridget
allowed the Koopa Kronicles to flop in her fingers. &quot;Ookay..
nice to meet you too? Hey, I'm just weirded out and annoyed I let my
eyes wander with this basic-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hey!..
I mean, I didn't mean to brainwash you!&quot; Toadette sputtered.
&quot;And myself simultaneously-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bridget
brandished the zapper. &quot;Creep!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad cut
in, &quot;Got a point. That cassette's only for wooing ladies,
homegirl. So times two, well..&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
about died looking over at the recovering Toad.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
happened next was violent- for the television set and the wall with
it, blown to smithereens by that zapper. &quot;This never happened.
Mess with me again and you're bloody dead!&quot; Bridget stomped away
through the new opening, ignoring the door and Toadette's efforts to
stop her.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The pink
toad sighed dejectedly in the frame.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Did
that gambit teach you something new about yourself? I already knew
you had a type!&quot; He laughed before laying off. &quot;Well..
maybe Bucken-Berry will get it, maybe not. I do know this. A
doppelganger of mine is around, and I don't like that, and the King's
about to regret sending his goons into our city.&quot;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie sang
praises one minute that she had an expedient way to get out of that
scene, and then cursed the next. It was the originator of that lethal
ice ray. She turned to stone at the wheel, she blew through a light
by mistake, and every guard vehicle that passed by stuck the fear of
Eldstar in her that she&rsquo;d be recognized as a friend of Boo.
What had gotten into them and where to start?</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She flew
to the Mushroom Press and parked around back, away from street view.
She tiptoed inside and was clocked instantly, receiving a quizzical
but not accusatory look from the red haired human, Jessie at her
desk. Kylie wondered if she overreacted, plopping down in her cubicle
and reviewing pictures. Unfortunately she&rsquo;d stopped snapping
before the carnage. Her foot slipped an inch from moisture on her
chair mat. She&rsquo;d gotten away so quickly slush- from the murder,
was still melting from the ridges of her shoe&hellip; </font>
</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">When she
pulled up to her co-workers condo off Pleasant Path, the Lexus that
should have been there was missing and the front door was wide open.
There was just enough adrenaline still pumping through her to not
lose it as she propelled herself to his porch.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mitch?!
Are you okay?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The green
toad normally had a beautiful place, mid century meets a person who&rsquo;s
traveled for career, gotten acquainted with many, and collected a
multitude for it, odd trinkets, signed photos, and posters. In the
darkness, Kylie could perceive that Mitch&rsquo;s table and sofa,
even the hardwood floor was marred with papers and folders spread
about. She tripped over something on the ground, the gold dislodged
lock from his door.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
paid locksmiths to do that. My keys were lost when the car went to
the scrap yard.&rdquo; Mitch said from the closed up adjacent room.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His
normally dark silky tone was even more warbly since the hospital.
Kylie calmed regardless standing at the door. In the picture on a red
painted accent wall, they were young in bathing suits, having fun on
some beach. The reporter began to wonder if that came off weird to
anyone else Mitch dated since though.. In another below Mitch was
fresh faced in a vest and white pants, the getup of any spritely
castle toad. She gloomed. One day they&rsquo;d discovered a letter
for Mitch in the mail. It was his dream. He&rsquo;d babble forever
and agonized over the final interview, however..</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">..Why
would ya frame that with the happy memories?&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Huh?
Oh that one. Because that was the day I began my life's mission.
We've been through that. Anyway, I knew you'd show. I know what
happened, babe.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie got
her focus back. &ldquo;Righto.. Outta nowhere Boo has these species
war ideas! What do you think got into them? You&rsquo;re on the mends
I know, but I got nobody, not even your noki intern. They&rsquo;re
gonna connect me eventually. I mean I was in the front row!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
were..&rdquo; He acknowledged. &ldquo;I wanna help but..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Mitch,
don't be that way!&quot; she begged. &quot;I only need you to get
into their head.&quot;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
have. Because they&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A shiver
went through her spine as Boo drifted through the front wall. &ldquo;Hello,
Ms. Kylie. Mr. Mitch.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
reporter proceeded with the care of traversing a minefield, trapped
shell against Mitch&rsquo;s door. She thought for a moment to run or
enter the room, if even accessible, but held fast. &ldquo;-Boo.
Fella. None of this brings us closer to getting Peach back. Ain&rsquo;t
that the crux of this all? You can&rsquo;t rampage wantonly. You&rsquo;ll
be like Zoo!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The boo&rsquo;s
mouth became a flat line, eyes remaining slightly squinted but
intense. The held object was the discarded Bowser racket from the
game that Zoo initially stole. &ldquo;Wrong, Ms. Kylie. Boo Diddley&rsquo;s
cousin killed many. I won&rsquo;t kill again&hellip; Unless. I. Have.
To.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With
another whoosh they were gone.</font></p>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The statue
of Princess Mush IV, contested ruler of 444 AD, remained crumbling
and unrepaired, parts and sections scattered in the grass at random
places like no one cared. It reminded the boo diddly of.. well..
Everyone in Toad Town and beyond knew at this point. Puffs of smoke
dotted the skyline and businesses were boarding up their windows. The
last fool that challenged Booigi ii orbited above like a 'shooting
star', the gleam in the boo's eye rivaling such as followers of their
cause, many armed, amassed. By the power of Eldstar, every single one
of those toad oppressors would be extinguished!</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Chuck, the
spike Booigi met yesterday approached with a new letter, more than
usual discomfort across his visage. A threat? Another baseless rumor?
They'd dedicated Chuck to trekking back and forth from Parakarry's
office. He'd had many messages so far, none of their foes bold enough
to infiltrate the park and personally confront them yet. Booigi
unfolded it, written neat with a steady hand.</font></p>
<p><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hi.
You should know by now that my brother and I are after Bowser. That's
the only reason I can't run down. When I do return though, we need to
talk, 'buddy'.&quot;</font></em> 
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A glimmer
of 'Boo Diddley' resurfacing, Booigi ii flipped it around to the
single green spotted wheelchair bound toad huddling in the group.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Let
him.&quot; Mitch chuckled darkly.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A snifit
mask fogged up from his strained gasps in the thin air and icicles
forming in his eyelashes could not blot out the nagging sense that a
bad guy was in close proximity, snapping the officer out of the
dizzied state the sub-orbital launch plunged him in.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Halt!
I hope you are staying on the straight and narrow!&quot; Snift Patrol
lectured, the menacing iron and flesh villain flying alongside him
picking it up with super audial receptors.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy Delta
broke out of his campy action pose; two fists jutting forward like
Super Koopa, and waved back. It was rocket thrusters that placed him
in the exosphere instead of a tennis racket. &quot;I like being bad,
sorry officer. Executing: 'Find Backstabbing Friends Desu'!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;What
happened?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Theft.
AGAIN... I wanted to call them out but, I don't know, something
stopped me..&quot;.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;..I'll
let cha by with a warning,&quot; the snufit drawled, aware his
citation book was long gone anyway. &quot;Citizen, when I joined my
first vigilante gang some of those friends weren't very friendly to
be frank. I found a team where we respected everyone. That's most
important.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well, Iggy
Delta had prepared for a patronizing session, not.. that. &quot;-I
know, but I was more confused at them with irrational pattern
functions, don't worry you don't need to know what that is. Often
they genuinely did some cool stuff for me, like get me out of the
basement a lot and dive me to cons and get me into clubs and kicked
out of clubs and almost within six feet of attractive females- a
personal best!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hm.
If you are convinced they deserve a second chance you should see if
they're willing to apologize and return your paraphernalia. If not, I
can arrest them!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Ooh
with the electric behavioral correction rod?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Snifit
Patrol patted around his holster. &quot;I hope you mean 'taser',
because yes indeedy! Meet me back up here and please don't take the
law-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He was
already gone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Into
your own hand..&quot;</font></p>
<p>&hellip;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy Delta
soared gung-ho through darkened tropical skies, activating x-ray
vision to find his targets on the dolphin shaped island. Looks like
their getaway/vacation was a bummer. The coastal Delfino Plaza was a
ghost town. Further inland natives could be seen safely in upper
floors of buildings or under ground level terraces to shelter from
rain. He tuned in his hyper sensitive audio capturing..</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
swam and swam, swimmingly out of the way brah, and ouch that stuff
still hurts!&quot; some raccoon at a fruit stand was saying to a
yoshi.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Useless.
Iggy Delta reformulated for 3.4343 seconds. The cyborg blast off in a
Westward location. Sunshine Airport was closed for weather. Ricco
Harbor was also non-operational, with a colossal shipwreck at the
port. It appeared the rescue of the cargo ship had already concluded.
As he traveled closer to Sirena Beach the clouds grew exceptionally
black and thick, the sunlight unable to penetrate at all. Dipping
below, the beach, Hotel Delfino, everything had vanished, replaced
with an inky shiny substance, at ocean level. The molecules of the
water and other substances would not mix, making a distinct blotch of
black in the water that sizzled and rippled defiantly as rain patter
it. In disbelief, the cyborg dove closer, rescanning. He detected
concrete and metal and inorganic followed by organic material beneath
him. His heart thumped harder. The hotel was there all along,
depressed at least fifty feet down with the chasm filled to the top
with that- 'stuff.' Addicted to new discovery, the genius poured all
his computing resources into identifying the gunk, dropping closer,
two feet away.</font></p>
<p><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Y
O U A RE N EXT.&quot;</font></em> 
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The goop
writhed, it gurgled, it acknowledged him as a tentacle like mass
whipped out at the speed of lightning. Iggy Delta evaded by a
millimeter, rocketing blindly to the closest land, the mountains
behind the hotel site. His clumsy landing in the supple wet soil
embedded half of his body. He wanted to feel like a Sh&#333;nen
protagonist not.. Those other types of manga!</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Woozily he
unearthed, the prominence of the friendship woes fading. Something
unnatural happened here. He turned to the left, catching sight of an
alcove in the mountains with survivors. He couldn't believe his
ocular sensors. Someone was carrying around a bell! He fired five
lasers on the spot.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yowch!&quot;
The bellhop dropped the molten brass object, blowing over and kissing
his fingers. &quot;Stop playing around and get in here! And
definitely don't try to dive in the goop!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Whoops,
I thought.. Nevermind. What's going on, man?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
bellhop shrugged.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Developing
the hypothesis from scratch it was.. The pianta kept his distance as
Iggy entered, flushing from his over reaction at Hotel Delfino's old
desk bell. There were others present, a few with flashlights, spotted
around or behind the lava stalagmites. Swoopers screeched distantly.
By a more mechanically enhanced survey, Iggy determined there were
thirty here, possibly more in other caves.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hang
tight!&quot; The bellhop tossed a fresh hotel embroidered towel in
his face. &quot;Not to be rude, uh, mecha-koopaling brah. Some
splattered on you!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">As Iggy
wiped off with more embarrassment, there was a gasp. Someone heavily
stomped closer, bumping others, cracking a stalagmite or two.
Slamondon, alone, prostrated himself before Iggy. His shredded robe
revealed cauterized spots and the lower part of his chin was
discolored, like he'd bitten through his lip at one point.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Please
forgive me!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-I
do! Um.. W-where's Sam?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Slam rose
slowly, and Iggy knew. He shot out the cave, through that poisonous
black cloud and into the unadulterated crest of the atmosphere. Some
goop hiding beneath his calculator watch began to react, dissolving
the resin band and searing him like a million soldering guns jabbing
him at once. He swatted at his wrist repeatedly to make it stop.
Worse, Snifit Patrol was untraceable on his radar. He could be
anywhere in the solar system.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Shrewdly
choosing the most empty table in the prison's outside eating court,
the sight of some familiar scoundrels was like the amber sun above
peeking through the clouds to the noki.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-No,
my mom is working on my bail,&quot; Azul the blue, or mostly orange
in the jumpsuit, the shy guy explained from the table. &quot;She'll
only need to take like sixteen hundred more extra shifts at the Li'l
Oink farm.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
can't contribute?&quot; snorted Dr. Terrace. His uniform, even
unbuttoned, was taut around the whomp's square back. His tray was
picked though, he ate the proteins, skipped the veggies.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
converted all my gold bars to digital before that market crashed
hard, so I just joined a MLM last week. After recruiting a few people
I'll make bank, even from jail! Y'all will be my downline right?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;What
does that entail?&quot; The elderly toad beside him was intrigued yet
cautious. &quot;Nothing unethical I hope? It's usually never that
easy.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Azul drew
out a long sigh. &quot;Look, we're already locked up for conspiracy.
Heard of that double jeopardy thing? Are you in or not?&quot; He
slumped, arms folded coolly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr.
Terrace smirked. &quot;Put me as a 'maybe', child.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-We're
getting distracted! Stop it!&quot; exploded the toad to the right of
Terrace, Nass Toad, the fourth and final at that table. Her black
hair hung limp and oily, almost unrecognizable if not for her
designer prescription glasses. &quot;We are to focus on (escaping..)
so we can confront Theodore over tricking us and eventually I can&hellip;&quot;
She teared up, prompting Mariam to pat her hand from the opposite
side. &quot;..Speak to my daughter.. Like I should have before.&quot;
She blushed and thanked the distaff toad, then hardened particularly
to the men. &quot;Capeesh?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
nodded obediently.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Do
you mind, Madame? I don't need directions this time. Thanks.&quot;
Jelectro slid onto the bench next to the older toad, '(Mariam?)' as
he'd just bothered to learn.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Her face
sparkled in recognition of that 'hot' exotic visitor, causing the men
to gawk and Nass to spit a little of her water.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-I
will be short.&quot; Jelectro dramatically uncovered the Couples
Cake. &quot;I am thirty-five today! Shame my useless, uh..
'assistant' forgot about that can't-eat-alone quirk of this
scrumptious dessert. Any takers?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
despise inept assistants.&quot; Nass slid her tray forward, the mushy
food on it half eaten. &quot;But I'm full, thank you.&quot; That was
echoed by Dr. Terrace and lil rascal Azul. Meanwhile Mariam remained
fixed on it, licking her lips even. A bit peculiar for an eighty year
old with two empty trays before her, but it would work for him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With the
cake to them alone, both raised their safety composite material
sporks together, and gave a toast with the paper water cups. &quot;Bon
appetit.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Thank
you, dearie.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Then she
impossibly dug in alone, devouring the small cake in seconds. The
noki resigned himself until there were crumbs left. He sort through
it with his spork, poking at an unexpectedly </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">plastic</font></em>
<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">knife within.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Merde,&quot;
he growled. Amongst the watchmen outside the fence was the strollin
stu Agent 0088, his old civilian name lost in the sands of time,
ogling the noki. Jelectro knew he was French, but he did not deserve
betrayal THAT bad. He massaged his temple preemptively. He wouldn't
be outside the cell again today. This was his only chance.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-It's
Zip Toad!&quot; a guard squealed, with a passcode to open the
floodgates to the outside world. That prompted troves to abandon
their post and swarm the celebrity on the property outskirts, unseen
by the public since three years ago.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jelectro
left the table with the pan. &quot;Good luck doctors,&quot; he
purred. With his short height and the abrupt lack of supervision, he
closed in for a better view unhindered.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Autograph?
PLEASE?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No
me!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;ME!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">As they
crowd in, the blonde celebrity backed up until his foot dipped in the
air. Pebbles dislodged by his sneakers rolled down the steep hill the
jail sat on.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Get
back you animals!&quot; he barked, whipping out a gun at them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh
no, it's a banana! That thing Zip T. had a relapse over! Get it away
from him!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A warden
lunged into Zip T, propelling both off the precipice. They tumbled
relentlessly half the way down, whacking together against a large
boulder.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Retrieve
him, idiots!&quot; radioed the senior officer from the look-out
tower.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Her
underlings scaled down the treacherous area, dreading the lawsuit
certain to ensue, or conversely eager to prove how capable they were
after that embarrassing fawning over a Z-lister. The most quick and
sprightly of such kneeled with the dazed victims, whereupon their
vision whited out for a second. Now a strollin stu was in the spot of
Zip T., banged up and bruised. The officer that initially fell tugged
the flabbergasted guard's arm.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Dylan,
behind you!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A torrent
of orange inmates made the earth rumble, their downward momentum
breaking through the guard's attempt at a blockade. Scattering into
the city below, some officers were squashed. Others like Agent 0088,
were dragged along, and the unscathed remaining gave chase. The
watchtower was so tall, by the time the senior warden was on the
ground, she was alone in a completely silent mess hall. The tables
were empty. Food trays forgotten. Papers were blown about by the
wind. The woman broke a glass box, retrieving the Squirt Gun Thing
encased inside. She charged away with a war cry, leaping over a
covered cake pan on the floor.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The silver
pan lifted. Jelectro picked the lock in the offices with his binned
items, then changed into his normal getup, leisurely taking the nice
pathway out of that place, blending in with tourists at least close
enough. The secret agent simpered about not only getting out, but
with his secret identity intact. Unfortunately he was nowhere near
the Keelhaul river, rather in a maze-like shopping district. He had a
drilling headache from that grand scale projection illusion, perhaps
the biggest he'd ever conjured and he didn't want any shopkeeper to
gape at the only noki in rural Poshley Heights scuttling around and
with a worsening nosebleed. He cut through a shady tree filled park
where he could sense there was only one soul around. He went all the
way though, crunching on unraked leaves from last autumn, without
coming up on that other person. He thought little of it until in
direct sun again, it remained shadowy over his body.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The noki
spun and lanced the newly materialized attacker in the abdomen with
the plastic knife. They locked eyes as blue blood glistened from
broken skin. Jelectro swiped under his Hawaiian shirt, his
experimental freeze gun missing. The noki's turn to succumbto
distraction, the attacker smashed a mini practice amplifier over his
head. Later he'd realize it still worked, because it was a Peavey.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
dare say you cannot park there,&quot; warned the gentlemanly parking
enforcer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yeah,
hehe?&quot; The steely eyed illegal parker slammed down the trunk of
his black wide bodied sedan before the toad came around and slapped a
ticket on him. Shortly stuck at a blaring railroad crossing, the
driver checked himself out in the side mirror, feeling around his
jaw, pleased he remained below the threshold of having too much
greying stubble for a snorkel to fit properly.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
rainbow haired koopaling shifted the stiff seats. If only he'd packed
his travel cushion, or anything actually. This place didn't have
coloring books either, making it a mild form of torture if Lemmy was
honest. At least they were long past Riverside Station. Brown terrain
adopted a steady gradient to green. Soon cultivated fields and
asymmetrical victorian style homes with turrets and pastel colors
were perceptible through the dusty glass.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
accepted a wrapped protein bar spontaneously from a steward passing
by and scoffed it down. Then a second and third. Lemmy thought about
how used to hate such foods, equating them to an experiment in Iggy's
basement. After requesting the fourth, Ludwig caught himself and
pocketed it for later in the green knitted shawl from Kammy. The
change in appetite, claws darkening at the quick, and dull appearance
of scales.. Lemmy silently determined his brother needed an
intervention about the symptoms of his chronic lack of sleep. Could
it explain even replacing him with Wendy?</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He placed
it aside, determined to not become negative. Get pumped!</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Are
ya Luddy?.. Pumped I mean?.. Fun fact: where we're going is where my
troupe blew those snooty Cirque du Angry Solei jerks off the stage.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That got
his brother to look at him head on, just not like how he meant. A
painted hard clay mask of an Angry Sun from a costume chest was
topically his disguise for the journey. &quot;Understand.. That..&quot;
He cleared the scratchiness from his throat. &quot;My actions up
until and including now were not to vex you. In due time I will
explain-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Both were
slung out of their seats by the train breaking. As the amount of
passengers onboard rapidly diminished, Ludwig found his will to obey
divine orders, purportedly, (he couldn't rule out being a lunatic)
oozing out of him at about the same rate. A bob-omb buddy in an
engineer cap had a checklist to verify everyone, miffed at the sight
of a koopaling and artsy clown. No matter his opinion, Lemmy
possessed a work pass to travel anywhere, even in 'wartime' so they
were free. The glossy floors of the train station were slick to them
yet absolutely no one else, at least if wearing shoes. Thick marble
pillars held up renaissance painted high ceiling, amplifying the
clamor of patrons from the market tents, locomotives shuffling, and
well to do toads, bob-bomb, and bumpty walkers inclined to stop and
be talkative smack in the middle anywhere they happened to be,
including the revolving doors out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
froze. &quot;BRB.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Lemmy!&quot;
Ludwig scanned for him unsuccessfully though the slits in his mask.
Exasperated, he yanked it downwards some to peer at some high mounted
monitors over the ticket station with train schedules, intending to
read the time of day. To his horror, there was a banner scrolling on
the bottom.</font></p>

</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
wobbled from side to side.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Drink!&quot;
Someone nearly knocked him over, shoving a blue surgery slurpee drink
into his face. Ludwig chugged half of it before he pushed the jumbo
sized cup away from him. Lemmy gave him space then. &quot;Better?
What was that about?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Enduring
the brain freeze, Ludwig explained, &quot;Our enemies, adept as they
are in creating their own scandals, have made strides in ruining us.
That is what!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Downtown
was less showy and picture estique than the celebrity villages and
country offerings, rather aiming to be serene and pleasure filled,
featuring brick paved sidewalks tepid by the afternoon sun and
innumerable clubs, shops and inns. Citizens with top hats, canes,
clutch purses, or a well groomed poochy on a leash, strolled directly
in the middle of the street, vehicles rare, like they'd traveled back
in time. A pedestrian overtaken by the curiosity of a koopaling and a
'clown' meandering around would step in their way with a 'pardon me'
or such drivel, which Lemmy would expertly respond to with a 'talk to
the hand' gesture. Too peculiar apparently to be ignored, this
delayed them all the way to the bookstore, not the primary reason
Ludwig wanted Lemmy to accompany him, but one of them. Ludwig's other
spot was thankfully close, across a suspension bridge spanned a
slightly wide yet underused canal.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
granite Auditorium for Conscientious Villainy stood behind eighth
flagpoles of each major kingdom with an infamous flower arrangement
of a Bowser Flag in the lawn- which some moving truck had driven
trenches all over. A magikoopa with a long silver goatee, followed by
a slew of others carrying suitcases and carry-on bags filed outside
the auditorium, the final one dropping his keys in the hands of the
toad officers manning the door.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That sick
feeling returning, Ludwig stepped up. &quot;What is the matter?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A more
middle aged magikoopa at the back of the group broke off while the
others continued. The koopaling recognized that blue one as a
recruiter. &quot;Wonderful to see you, Prince Ludwig. We sent a
message out rush delivery, of course Parakarry is so unreliable
sometimes. We had to dissolve as of today.&quot; He sorrowfully
watched his brothers load the vehicle. &quot;The King insists on
rebuilding his daughter's castle here and their tolerance of us was
already tentative you know.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Elder,
my claiming responsibility for destroying Peach's castle was a ruse,
one of many unforeseen events yesterday. You have persisted here for
decades! I never fathomed- that-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The elder
gave him a bittersweet smile, pressing a thin flimsy memento into his
hand. &quot;Your diabolical schemes are unmatched. Only, the fun and
friendly rivalry between us and the Mushroom folk can not last.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yes. It.
Should! Eldstar, the epitome of 'fairness', requires good and bad
both to exist and spar for the sake of balance. It dawned that the
effects of the Great star being unreachable had rippled down to their
world already.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy felt
the urge to mark a more up to date minute hand on his scribbled on
watch. He didn't after all, able to feel deep within that it was
approximately correct. Meaning..he was late.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The old
postmaster from Toad Town had a shift at the bookstore that day,
organizing and sorting a vintage collection of 'Rocks: What they are
and where to find them'. If Lemmy encountered the paratroopa while
his troupe was in town, this being their cozy wind down spot, they
kept it affable. This was someone who remembered times before his dad
ever invaded the Mushroom Kingdom. Sitting on the couches the store
featured, primarily only paying attention to the pictures in old
books, the paratoopa would commend Lemmy for assimilating, apparently
under the impression that Lemmy cut Koopa Troop ties. To his credit,
the koopaling had not revealed to even family what his end goal was
with the balancing act on stage and in the Troop. That was for
another day. When Lemmy asked for 'Ex Spatio Obiecti Specialem
Lexicon&quot;, the mature paratroopa raised his voice for the first
time ever, drilling into him that it contained 'dangerous'
information. Crotchety and relenting once it was all spilled out,
also enticed by coins, the bookkeeper wrapped the book delicately
with parchment tied with a string so 'thieves' wouldn't pry. Now this
was getting kinda interesting, continuing when an escaped criminal on
a bike almost flattened Lemmy outside the store, the koopaling
needing to cartwheel away for safety.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Some
officers carrying a giant water gun blasted the koopa off, continuing
to hose him into the waiting open paddy wagon. That was neat and
frightening, so much that Lemmy took the longer tranquil suspension
bridge route to mellow out. He was so slow in his opinion without the
ball, he might as well enjoy it. As he slid his paws over the
bridge's rail, often something gold slithered around in the olive
colored water thirty feet below, fish he guessed. Less ambiguous, a
gondola drifted underneath with a spiffy human captaining it and a
female noki on the rear holding a lorgnette, whispering a lot between
them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Paranoid
from the postmaster's advisory, Lemmy hastened across to the
rendezvous, a fountain with shy guy and cheep cheep statues and his
brother sitting on the edge, snout buried in his hands. He was
maskless, the shawl slung over his back, and had no badge fixed to
him, unless it was invisible and its specific effect was making
Ludwig look like a miserable corpse.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
plastered on a smile. &quot;One outta two ain't bad!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
accepted the package with a quiet thanks, holding it up, gracing the
edges with his claw and then tucking it under his arm.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Hey.
Are you okay?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Eyes
clenched shut, &quot;I've only inadvertently snuffed out the
institution that could have awarded me something that proves to Vater
that I am worthy of succeeding him is all...&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A chill
went through Lemmy. &quot;O-oh&hellip; That's why huh? Umm..&quot; He
stepped away, pacing a bit. &quot;You have a million talents. You
can't accept things?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
shot upwards. &quot;We aren't children anymore! It's not about greed
or ambition or arbitrarily because I am the oldest! I yearn for the
salvation of our people and while I sincerely believe Vater does as
well, we have seen him all our lives fall into habits that have
historically brought his predecessors their downfall!&quot; He took a
deep breath. &quot;However, I was too savy for my own good-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Luddy.
Don't give up the scheme like that..&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Cease
it Lemmy. I bleated all about it while you took one hour two minutes.
I expired last night my opportunity before we obtained our tickets
here.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
again had that petrified expression. &quot;..Can I ask you something?
About last night?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He perked
up. &quot;What?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Can
you tell me the thing you're not telling me?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Can
you?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yes.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
first.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Nooo
it was my idea, so you first!&quot; Lemmy half teased.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
paused solemnly. He knew this was inexorable. &quot;Notwithstanding
rational explanations, merciful gods have tasked me to locate
malicious star entities whose leader possessed and executed me last
night..&quot;</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;AAAAAAAHHHHHHH!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
gunned down the block so quickly the gust knocked Ludwig into the
fountain. He climbed out and followed his brother into a more
populated spot where people shrieked or fled. Lemmy stopped at a
crossroads, his thumb in the air.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I am
not being fictitious! I was not supposed to even share that with you
and, and-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">This time
Lemmy's powerful 'talk to the hand' gesture knocked Ludwig back like
a force field, clashing into the pottery of the storefront behind
him. &quot;That is crazy Luddy. I'll take a cab home.. I can't right
now. I just can't!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">On cue
walking traffic thinned and a black sedan, marked 'CAB' rolled by.
Lemmy swung inside. Ludwig kept close, waving for attention for
another block, the pedestrians ahead holding the vehicle at single
digit speeds. An animated discussion was occurring inside he could
tell. He hoped the cabbie didn't take plastic. Once they'd strayed
towards another rural portion of the city that river sliced through,
it was a typical obstacle free road for cars.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
glared at Ludwig from the side mirror. &quot;Hit the pedal to the
metal!&quot; he ordered the driver.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
better remember the pin later..&quot; the pink boo hissed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The car
backfired, noxious smoke blocking Ludwig. He couldn't afford to be
deader than dead. When it cleared the car was gone. He ran his claws
through his hair, some of which fell out in a clump. Whittling away
exponentially anguished him as well. Instantaneously he felt
stretched in so many directions! Biting back trepidation he jogged
again, keeping to the bank river and following the street, praying
there were no turn offs. Gentlemen with sticks and ladies with
parasols responding to reports of koopalings in the neighborhood
began to hunt him down. This was the brutality and complexity of his
existence now. As Lemmy touched on astutely, he would have to accept
it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Monsieur
Koopa,&quot; half yelled a French sounding woman.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
lugged his attention to the gondola.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Get-a
discount ride today. Got-a special someone? Wish I-a did..&quot; the
human carrying the ores grunted, Italian accent heavier than a Mario
brother's. &quot;50 coins.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The noki
woman stubbed his toe. &quot;Lets cut ze act. Monsieur Koopa, We are
after zhat 'cab' too. Climb aboard!&quot;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
Southern Hospital had their deluxe recovery spaces at the fringes of
the Toad Town border. Consequently it was the only part of town where
a native rancher or cowboy might catch a glimpse of those famous
Mushroom Buses that strayed down exactly once a day, about now
actually.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
spotted bus arrived at the stop, its tiny double doors opening with a
perceived hesitance. Someone standing back in an adventurer's garb, a
red scarf, a headlamp and weighty backpack, held his excitement by a
thread as a few trickled out, excruciatingly slow. Some bus riders
had brought their Yoshis on board, who did not want to step off. He
would not blame them if they were as intelligent as that other
notable one.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He plopped
down on the bench, affording him a view that reminded him of why he
didn't bother to date. Toadette and Bucken-Berry were still fighting
right outside Mr. Toad's door!- the tagalong, a young red toad,
quivering in a barrel. Finally, after a mutual shove, the toadette
rebounding solidly against the barrel, the blue toad stormed off. The
barrel flipped and rolled against the side of the house. The young
toad scored out, apologized to Toadette who didn't hear it likely
over her own crying, and slamming of Mr. Toad's door as she retreat
in, and chased Bucken-Berry, only after looking at The Captain from
afar first.. Like he might be a future problem..</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Blessings
unto you, Captain!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
Captain whipped around, facing his most wondrous brigade standing
there, the remaining departing people weaving around them. He
brightened like a star festival. Two held gifts.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
too, my crew. You shouldn't have!&quot; When he reached for Yellow
Toad's polka dot wrapped present box, he lifted it out of reach. The
Captain was predictably unable to hop for it with his backpack on.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Captain,
this.. is.. for... ZZZZZZ!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
Captain gave up with a sigh. &quot;Wake up J&ouml;rg! Who is it for
then?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;The
miraculously recovered Mr. Toad will need lots of electrolytes and
supplements, Captain.&quot; Hint Toad was the second one with a gift,
matched gift wrap, though taller and taped more neatly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
Captain directed the death glare to him. &quot;Heinemann, great tip.
Sure needed that..&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Well,
that's the only reason we, uh, like came.&quot; Mailtoad retrieved
from his pocket a hidden third gift, a gift card.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Mordecai,
now you? Bowser has returned to his kidnapping ways and right now we
have a grand opportunity before us to assist in her rescuing efforts!
Oh and there may also be treasure involved. Ready for adventure?&quot;
The Captain triumphantly marched a little ways towards the road to
Mt. Rugged, mortified that he was alone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-You
aren't listening, Stanley,&quot; spoke up a calm yet firm speaking
light green toad. Banktoad possessed a matching headlamp and a not so
matching arm sling, The Captain's nephew, six months older than him
in a mundanely interesting way. &quot;Have you seen Mr. Toad
yourself? They're saying he convinced the King's people that aliens
have something to do with this all?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
Captain slowly returned, gritting his teeth. &quot;Why, of course..
until a nurse realized I was on his banned list.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;God..&quot;
the nephew groaned. &quot;As we keep saying though, we bought
overpriced tickets and rushed over from Darker Side because we want
to support Mr. Toad, not to go on an adventure with you.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Whatever!
Lead the way then, Bill...&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">In the
short walk, the brigade were already going 'ooh' and 'ahh' at amazing
new sights like shy guys riding ostros, shanty cabins, tumbleweeds,
flowering cacti, cowboys wrangling, and other so-called wonders of
Southern Mushroom Kingdom. The Captain waited yet again while the
brigade visited Toad, now on the steps of the porch. Idly he'd play
with pressing strategic locations of arteries to block blood flow and
make something go numb, what he was fascinated with on occasion. He
could incapacitate an enemy without a mark, and he did hate to leave
marks.. After twentyish minutes he was ticked off and leaving
abrasions anyway- on himself. They had to get ahead of the Mario
bros!</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A door
opened, unleashing a roar of laughter from Yellow and Hint Toad. The
others including Toadette were in more subdued conversation. She semi
supported Banktoad's left side, opposite of the broken arm, together
colliding with the others when Captain Toad blocked them suddenly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Ms.
Toadette, pleasant to see you. We not only collect Green Stars and
coins, but also artifacts now.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She sort
of forced curtsy as Banktoad was rolling his eyes. &quot;Hi. You
don't say, Captain?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Not
impressed? The 'Doom Reverb' Zoo Diddley owned was one we've
encountered and disposed of in the past!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Is
that a flex?&quot; She stared, alarmed. &quot;That's literally like
the impetus to.. Ugh! How did Zoo get it back?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Ma'am,
if malignant we bury artifacts in Fahr Outpost where the soil deep
freezes for eight months every year!&quot; Hint Toad impulsively
volunteered. &quot;We're still investigating!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-So
there's more of those out there and we're running on conjecture..&quot;
Toadette leaned against a support beam, growing pale.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Not going
how he planned, The Captain yanked his nephew off the porch by the
ear, whispering, &quot;You fancy her, do you not? Help me out here!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Appalled,
&quot;She just broke up with a boyfriend of five years!&quot; He
pushed him away with his good arm. &quot;And because of you, look at
her now.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Captain
Toad huffed, then spoke out loud, &quot;Yes, look at her now, all
because I recall it was William who lost track of the bell during our
last Sarasaland expedition!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Because
you 'accidentally' shoved me off a sphinx, Stanley!.. The injury I'm
currently recovering from!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh
right, how could I forget? ..Well anyway, There are many more like
that one, proof being the state of Bowser's Castle and this morning
the out of season hurricane that hit Isle Delfino.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yellow
Toad flushed. &quot;Captain, we were around there when our jet hit
wake turbulence and lost 8000 feet of altitude! I thought we would
die but then&hellip;ZZZZ..&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Well
it must not have been that scary. Mordecai, give Ms. Toadette this
apocrypha. She may borrow it to learn a little more of our new
specialty.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Without
contestation, Mailtoad passed the thick book from The Captain's
backpack to Toadette, who was not going to entertain the offer until
seeing it was a lexicon of sorts, explicitly stamped as being library
owned. She thought about it as weightily as she could in those few
seconds.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Thank
you, but.. I'm burnt out on that now. Let me.. Check on Mr. Toad. I
think he needs something..&quot; she said, backing up into his room
and shutting the door, pressing her back against it. Breathing
heavily, there was no way she was getting involved with them again.
Who she was more concerned of, or for rather based on previous
conversation, wasn't The Captain, but his nephew.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Outside,
the Captain repacked the book, successful in arguing with and pulling
out of ear range his team a little ways down from those houses,
alongside a farm pasture with moo moos. He was at his wits end.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Finally he
picked up a rusty horseshoe, spun back to them, and bashed his own
face in with it. Again and again, until blood ran down from his brow
ridge.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Okay!&quot;
his brigade shout at once.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Satisfied
he dropped it. The joke was on them. He'd made that spot numb, of
course the pain would return later so.. Okay maybe he didn't
completely win on that one.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Let's
GO! Get out there! DO SOMETHING!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You're
mimicking Bowser!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;It's
sir to you, and uh, no I wasn't..&quot; the stealthy, except for his
blushing, lakitu muttered to the koopatrol. &quot;Man the borders
already, squirt!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">As there
was swampy ground to stand on semi solidly, the Koopa Troop secured
the region of Sky Land around Bowser Tower, which was coming along
nicely, more space available than they possessed provisions to fill
at the moment. Every KT did not have a bed exactly, but they could
claim a ten by ten partition, an upgrade for many, as their own
within the tower. Since the most scavenged thing was weaponry, that
filled otherwise vacant floors, cannons protruding out windows and
crates of ammo stacked so frequently it became like furniture, and
not too shabby, as long as one didn't light a match..</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
paragoomba on the rooftop's edge shook like a leaf following a lady's
shriek.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You!
Take me to the gate thing! I'm totes serious! Daddy has the dry bones
marking outlines EVERYWHERE! He's ruining my campaign!&quot; The
furious koopaling's arms were full of hot pink flyers, a few blowing
away where Hippity Hop could see.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Vote
Princess Wendy O. for Neo Bowser City! She will be strong, fair, her
beauty will pervade all, we will kidnap men for equality, and most
importantly she will promote the permanent destruction of plumbers!
Help her reshape the world into a beautiful place!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Good thing
she was too busy tantruming to notice Hippity's grimace. &quot;Yes,
my lady..&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
grabbed on as he flew her erratically over green hills. Five seconds
in the sixteen year old regret it. Kamek or Kammy on a dollar store
broom would have been quicker.. However she'd also catch old people
cooties so nevermind&hellip;</font></p>
<p>&hellip;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Meanwhile,
also high in the sky, Sentry 11 had within his crosshairs all
slackers, sweeping over the thousand or so minions, abandoned boats,
and building outlines, inching to find a stationary one and pounce-</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Instigating,
J.D.?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oof!&quot;
The sentry's binoculars bounced around slippery sweaty fingers. &quot;I
mean, just clocking slouchers, Boss.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kamek
skeptically shook his head, flying along on a broken vacuum. Soak and
wet, it appeared he'd been attempting to dry it out by this method.
&quot;You weren't about to pester Prince Larry?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Course
not!&quot; Obscured by the cloud, the lakitu cracked his knuckles..</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Considering
Lord Bowser pardoned him for conspiring with the princess, I'd hope
so! Hmm..&quot; the magikoopa went, thoughtfully. &quot;You ever do a
Turkish bath?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Kammy
and I were given permission to dedicate a floor to it. You know, with
this kind you take off your clothes and-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Know
what Boss? I'll just, uh, patrol ova there...&quot; Shivering, the
lakitu got away, disappointingly for him too far to spy anyone on a
certain teenager with a blue mohawk.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">On the
ground, Larry briefly had his shell against the side of a big gravel
pile, phone in hand. An unlikely account he followed actually
responded to his private message, a perk of being the only Koopaling,
or high ranking KT at all with an unflagged for villainous activity
social media page. He declared his 'break' over and joined the
workforce of the first project. The usual dynamic, the zealous, those
striving to rank up, or the chatty kept close to their leaders, the
koopalings in this case, and the more anti-social, shy, or one's just
doing their job hung in the back precisely to avoid the first group.
It was there where Larry waited behind one of the larger minions
preparing sections of the frame, Thwomp #3. He was older than most KT
with worn dull spikes. Not hearing him speak until just then, as he
did some sort of metric conversion for the struggling fire brother in
front of him, he sounded almost&hellip; Mushroomy. Larry would know
with plenty of online friends there.. But he had enough on his mind..</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The future
fortress site was in the shadow of Bowser Tower, directed by Morton
and Roy. The thunder brothers as they were being called now, had it
under control in their own chaotic way, slapping together prefab
parts rapidly, building a hollow and revealingly miniature structure
about a fifth the size of Bowser's Castle and half the size of a
typical Fortress they'd erect and uglify a seized area with. The
baddies shuffled inside. Hammer bro variants joined together wooden
parts, the rocky wrenches handed nuts and bolts, monty moles dug out
additional landscape, goombas and buzzy beetles relay blocks from
outside, whomps and thwomps pulverized slabs of stone into said
blocks, and most noisy of all, a frying noise emanate from two bald
heads as Roy and Morton dithered over a part of the blueprints..</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Junior
wants the sandcastle over there! Quickly! Godspeed!&quot; Morton
pointed to the right.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Roy
snatched the papers from him. &quot;Dats upside down. His swimming
pool's there. Let's just ask Nerd Breath. Whadya think?&quot; Roy
waggled the blueprints before Iggy, 2D looking and perpetually
holding one expression. To Larry it remarkably looked like a
hologram, but that would be ridiculous..</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;...&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Magnificent
point, Iggster. We should do nothing for Junior, for he is spoiled
rotten, pampered, coddled like a baby! Let us construct him the most
monotonous castle ever!&quot; Morton suggested, to some rarely seen
praise towards him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">All the
koopalings, with some penitence depending on which, had moments where
they dipped into some Junior bashing. It clicked to Larry then what
was going on.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
casually came up to the tyke, drawing in the mud outside the
construction zone with a spare bone from a dry bone. He made out a
crude looking pointy building or something, further affirming his
suspicions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yo,
had a blast at Koopa Scouts?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He nodded.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Dang,
wish I could be one. Like, that getup is tight yo, uniform, hat,
scarf..&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Junior
continued to doodle. &quot;Sure,&quot; he answered perfunctorily.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
ain't hype over that? Bro, you bout to get a fresh fortress right
next to our freakin dad! He's gonna share his pay-per-view and watch
ya constantly and never let you leave his sight-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;That's
the problem! I miss camp and my friends and teachers and how I'm not
gonna get to go back anymore..&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bewildered,
Larry tilted his view around. The drawing was of an elaborate tent.
&quot;...You miss the way it was. Don't cha?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Junior
nodded in a mopy way he hadn't seen since his pet ran off and he was
told he couldn't have another. He glanced around in an unsubtle way,
cupped his hands and whispered, &quot;I'm gonna be tutored all the
time and stuff now. I heard daddy and grandpa and even grandma
talking about it..&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Was the
grass always greener for the favorite? Larry slowly realized not.
&quot;Well, hang in there and let me take some of that weight off of
you. Like literally.&quot; He pointed to the giant gold key that
snuggly fit in Junior's back pocket.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;That's
the key to the fortress thingy.&quot; Junior threw it to the ground,
hearing 'literal' as littering. Close enough.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
scooped it up. &quot;I know that. Know what else? Dad's too lazy to
buy unique locks.&quot;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Nooooo!
Noooooooooooooo!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With
bleeding ears, Hippity and his passenger landed at the KT owned
boundary in Sky Land. Wendy kicked off of him six feet from the
ground and stormed at the three people at the gate.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Who
is that?!&quot; Wendy dropped her flyers down. The koopatrol Tanner,
the koopa troopa Johnson, and the unknown toad girl stared and
blinked. &quot;Well?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Tanner
gave a salute. &quot;Princess Wendy! Umm.. Emery T. just arrived,
King Bowser's latest soldier from yesterday!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The toad
removed the scarlet scarf forming a hood, revealing her orange spots
and messy black medium length hair. She was dirty and unbothered by
it, evidently traveling some distance on foot and equally on top of
that soaked painting a few yards away. &quot;Yep, what he said.
What's up- Oops I mean, I await your command&hellip; Especially if I
get to see King's new getup. That'd be awesome!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wendy
continued to scrunch her nose at the mud covered toad girl, however
since that wasn't an enemy affiliated with vile plumbers after all,
she could salvage this. &quot;How about YOU folks, go to the city and
hand this out?&quot; She pressed the flyers on them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Princess.
These are.. Brilliant. &quot;Well trained, Johnson flashed an eager
disposition, at least while she was looking. &quot;By what means will
we travel?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
got feet don't cha? Or wings for Flippity Flop-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Princess
it's-!&quot; Hippity spat.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Thanks,
you are soooooo kind!&quot; she sang, leaving them with her heaps of
propaganda.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Delegating
to minions like her brother Ludwig had mastered freed her to stop
those fortresses from popping up everywhere. Could she see such
hideousness in kingdoms she'd love to own, like Water Land? Of course
not, so they were going to need to be weaned off the habit now! Next
time, she might even have the confidence to contest plans directly to
her father. Baby steps Wend, because another fault she was
discovering was that she was abysmal at navigating, lost in the
endless fog filled fields. She located the same landmark thrice now.
This time at least she'd remember to snap a photo for her friends in
the dungeon.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
obelisk in the middle of nowhere was captivating, so dark it sucked
in light around it, like a rectangular area of the universe was cut
out unless she was super close and could discern the raised small
characters on it. Her attempts to get a good angle in with the camera
was a failure, turning out blurry, or corrupting on memory. She flung
the stupid phone against it, with a crack. Oh Wendy girl, you gotta
think it through if you want to be mayor! Sheepishly she retrieved it
at the foot of the obelisk, the right side of her body gracing it as
she reached downward. A jolt went through her.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Her lips
parted as the secrets of millennia unravel before her eyes.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Ooh
look I-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hush!
They locked snacks here too!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Okay
I'm in!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Shhh!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I'm
in..&quot; Junior squeaked, giggling in the clothing bundle in his
little hands.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
peeked around the final corner. Bowser Tower's layout was pancaked
compared to the old castle, hiding spots sparse. Larry and Bowser Jr.
made it to the 'dungeon', more accurately the 'prison' since it was
not underground but arbitrarily on the fourth floor of the tower. The
KT hadn't gotten around to individual cells, or proper shackles, only
a single locked iron bar door.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With the
key inches away from the lock, harsh out of tune singing echoed below
them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;~Yo
ho ho, and I hope some kids aren't fooling round up here, and yo ho
ho&hellip;&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry, and
Junior after he roped him along, dove behind some stacked crates next
to the bars. A second later, Sentry 11 roved about, pausing at the
crates. From a slit between them Larry saw the hollow eye of the
smiley face etched on his cloud. He held his breath.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hey,
we need yer help!&quot; Thuds. Then Thwomp #3 came up to the floor.
&quot;Junior's fortress is fallin apart at the seams. We used the
wrong glue.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The lakitu
pivoted around, pinching between his eyebrows. &quot;You don't use
GLUE for a fortress, rockhead.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The thwomp
put on a dopey, if affected, expression. &quot;Dat splains it.. Check
it out will ya?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Growling,
the sentry accompanied him. Larry could have sworn he saw the thwomp
baddie wink before spinning his spiky body around. It was go time.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The gate
had a strident squeal, swinging open. Larry let it crash against the
wall, opening his arms wide and going, &quot;Yo! You're free!
Ruuuuunnn!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
recalled that there was more than a dainty princess and geriatric
toad entrapped when the hoard of teenagers trampled him at flat and
paper-like as Iggy was looking these days.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh
hi mama Peach!&quot; Junior screeched. &quot;Wear this!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The clack
of heels next and someone else, with slower muted steps- &quot;J-Junior?&quot;
Covering her mouth, Peach swept into Larry's view, flushing at his
brother. &quot;You are assisting us? Why, that is a pleasant
surprise. Thank you I suppose.&quot; She combed her hair down,
composing herself anxiously. &quot;And I am ready.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
slipped on the familiar looking magikoopa robes. One was blue and for
Toadsworth, indigo. The toad examined it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Tally
ho!&quot; he bellowed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry's
accordion-like arms popped up, one finger pointed. &quot;Freakin'
shhhh!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Nobody
screw this up! The princess was free just in time. It was extra moody
and dreary inside, the candles the only source of light then. They
had to get to the Giant Land to Sky Land boundary before it stormed
again. Dr. Greg of 'BATES', the famous hiphop oriented, bass heavy
headphone line was waiting for them.</font></p>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-You
don&rsquo;t hafta bring that up. I got it handled. The toads brought
our valuables from Hotel Mario. It only involved a blue polka dot bed
sheet, no other color would do, five gyros from Club Gamecube,
Joseph's vibrator- his alarm clock for the deaf, not.. and lastly for
one of them to dress up as Pauline to distract the receptionist.
Voil&agrave; .&ldquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;...Was
ALL that necessary to get them safely down South?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Haha.
Good catch. No but that's what they get for misbehaving according to
Toadette. The MKDCU brought Kinopio-Kun down too. We removed his
phone. Kids am I right?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hold
on.. How&rsquo;d you find those crazy health inspectors pard?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Your
janitor gave me the number. His brother&rsquo;s a founder.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Probabilly?
He ain&rsquo;t mentioned that! That makes him overqualified to sweep
around. Small world..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Literally
smaller, homeboy. Ours is half the size of the Real World Earth.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh,
you remembered that! Toad&rsquo;s right, with about seventy percent
the population. At least when I, unlike Mario, studied humanities in
the eighties.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey!
It&rsquo;s definitely grown since, little brother!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
population, not the planet. I don&rsquo;t think its girth works like
that. It&rsquo;s not your waistline!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The toad
and green plumber fist bumped, nestled in the back of the ostro drawn
carriage. Toad had a blanket around him muffling the rhythmic beat of
his portable heart monitor. Mario was up front with Jr. Troopa,
ignoring that comment. He presented himself classically, red shirt
and overalls. Clothes made the man, accompanied by a neatly trimmed
beard, to be recognizable and salient yet metamorphosed. This was his
swan song of an adventure on his terms, not because any action of
Bowser&rsquo;s was a &lsquo;victory&rsquo;, at least in the grand
scheme. For Troopa the Special World doctor&rsquo;s difficulties many
miles away reflected on him. If he assisted Mario and gang, a
complete 180 to the antics he had an old reputation for, that would
prove to Mr. X that he was responsible and buy more time. Luigi was
wary of his wrist watch. He promised a Boo he&rsquo;d be back in Town
in an hour to investigate the dilemma with the King&rsquo;s guards.
It wasn&rsquo;t looking like that would work out. The terrain
actively fought the squeaking wooden wheels and ostro boots on the
four beasts, weaving around coconut filled palm trees, traveling down
a beachy stretch that skirted Desert and Water Land. This rough and
rowdy passage would allow them to beat the K64 to Sky Land while
avoiding any major junctions. Bowser would be caught with his shell
down. They would rescue Peach and Toadsworth, restore order to Toad
Town, create an environment where they could cure the Mushroom Flu,
and NOT waste time plundering or whatever Captain Toad&rsquo;s greedy
endeavors were.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">One
thing my staff wouldn&rsquo;t tell me though was how Gold was holding
up.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi cut
in. &ldquo;You handled those other matters, let us tackle that.
You&rsquo;re exerting more than you should by riding with us. Until
we rescue Peach you&rsquo;re the sovereign of the Mushroom Kingdom!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Does
anyone see me like that?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;</font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I</font></em>
<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">do.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;..Aww.
Thanks. (Always wanted to hear you say that..)&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;..Usually.
Sometimes you deserve-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ouch!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oww!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Settle
down!&rdquo; admonished Troopa, reigns in one hand, holding down his
cowboy hat with the other. Funnily like Mario he didn&rsquo;t care
for banter..</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi,
you won&rsquo;t regret picking me. I&rsquo;m kinda surprised I made
the cut over Daze I&rsquo;m tryin to say.&rdquo; Toad&rsquo;s rasp
was void of any humor, so much so that if he didn&rsquo;t watch him
utter it, he might not believe it came from him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Of course
he'd thought about her. Each life in peril was precious, fueling his
determination to stomp Bowser. Hawk eyed Southerners spotted goombos,
nyololins, chikakos and other Sarasaland species their dialect
butchered, hovering about their princess in her new high security
room. Elucidation that Toad made up aliens unphased the Southerners
who insisted extraterrestrials routinely visited their crops. Her
people acknowledged her stable but non improving condition in a
benign way for now. They were allied. No one wanted this to threaten
that.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Toad,
don't get any survivor's guilt. I only remembered something about
your medical records. You're both going to make it!&quot; Luigi
roused valiantly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad's
feverish hand brushed his shoulder. &quot;I believe ya..&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He smiled
back, first real one he'd managed in a while. Though it looked odd to
many, there was something there, Toad the only associate not
contingent on his brother's feats, adventures or parties acquainting
them first. Without getting too deep into the Earl's tumultuous past
, neither of them signed up for the lot they had in life. They
detected that mutual fact instantly, and their friendship was
immutable, no matter how they may differed on the surface.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Psst,
partners. He's knocked out up here.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario was
slumped back, red duffle bag cradled in his lap like a teddy bear.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Now that
clapped Luigi back into reality. There was no canopy on the buggy.
Sweat was boiling on their foreheads. Kleptos kept circling. The
seats were stiff. The ostros occasionally got sick of being driven,
twisted around and pecked one of them at random as they entered Giant
Land. A rural kingdom with mild to tundra conditions, that wasn't too
peaceful either. The behemoths in spotted villages chased their
carriage beyond brush the size of trees, trees the size of buildings,
and buildings the size of skyscrapers. Mario slept through it all!
Luigi poked him once they'd escaped into a brown mountainous valley.
He stirred. Good, not in a coma or anything..</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Psst.
Again. I </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">love</font></em>
<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">his beard..&rdquo;
Troopa cooed spontaneously. Mario&rsquo;s hat was safely in grasp, so
that the wind couldn't whisk it off and, unsubtly, so the red
plumber&rsquo;s spiffy fade haircut, a touch of grey adorning the
sides, was out there.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh
you're.. Hey, I get it man. Our red plumber's not a beardfish like
King Elderberry. Makes him all masculine and mature...You into that?
Weird thing to say.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Troopa
turned his head slightly. &quot;And you randomly mentioning the
attractiveness of some rando wasn't?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Ha.&quot;
Toad flushed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Whatever,&quot;
Troopa continued, focusing on driving again. &quot;Can't say it to
his face when he's known me forever. Now THAT would be weird,&quot;
he admitted, his natural tone peeking through.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Because
he's so much older? ..Or human?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Mr.
Toad, my mouth is shut with gossipin' nurses over yonder.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;In
the jungle?&quot; Toad casually ducked from that stay arrow a Spear
Guy tossed. &quot;Wuss.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;What???
Okay fine! Sometimes humans, mostly toads have been my weakness for a
while...&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;</font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh,
wow!</font></em> <font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
do you like about them? The hair, skin tones, distinct stature or?-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
covered half his face with the bifold map, embarrassed. The Earl was
as partisan and feather-ruffling as Chancellor Toadsworth, just on
the other side of the spectrum. Likely that's precisely what Peach
was going for with those two in their positions...</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He sprung,
&quot;-Who was that Elderberry you mentioned, Toad?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
told you before, haven't I? Peach's dad&hellip; Are you switching the
subject?&quot; Toad giggled mischievously. &quot;Hey, how bout I ask
YOU what cha think about love?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
faced him head on. He could fire that back. Toad had never been
with.. anyone since they'd known each other. &quot;Hey, I'm not jaded
or repudiating this concept at all, it just that I feel it applies to
'normal' people. If you're a hero, how can you sustain a
relationship? People I never thought would have a fall out: Yoshi and
Birdo, Bucken-Berry and Toadette, and&hellip;our local eternal
frenemies.. Eh, if I'm blessed with this outside perspective it'd be
silly to walk into the trap. For now, not forever, but at least until
I have no more doubts, I'm vowing to remain single.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">For the
first time during the trip Toad went silent. Meanwhile Luigi's world
shook. Rocks tumbled down in their path with the loud rumble of
fracturing sedimentary rock. Their ostros went buck wild, catapulting
them out of control through the rest of the canyon. It led to a dried
salt lake where the reigns severed. Their carriage dumped the four
out in a ball. The mountain passage behind them was filled up with
heavy rocks, blocking the way back. They were stranded.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Momma
mia! I&rsquo;m up. I know the game is today!&rdquo; Mario rubbed his
head.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wish
I was dream&rsquo;n too, pard.&rdquo; Jr. Troopa, with an elasticity
from his comparative youthfulness, rose first. He prepared a lasso.
Problem was, he had one and there were four big birds to catch.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wait,&rdquo;
Mario slyly nodded to his brother and Toad. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s show
Jackson how we roll.&rdquo; He opened the red duffle back, the
interior emitted a glow visible even against the off white salt bed.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A ratty
noisy kart sped down a windy road. It ran parallel to a river with
its own source of commotion, blocked by a thin metal railing. Lemmy
glared at his brother flailing his arms. A human was rowing
frantically to keep up and a startled noki woman rigidly clutching an
open umbrella was the last occupant. Ludwig must have hijacked that
couple's gondola. What a douche, he thought, cranking his passenger
window down for a better view. It snapped in his hands and he
inwardly panicked for a moment, but the red boo didn't see. He tossed
it under the seat, where it clanged against unknown objects. Now the
cabbie glanced over. Quickly he made a scene-</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh
my goodness, is so disgusting how Luddy's making those people work.
Just look at him! Huh? Huh? Huh? See him? Huh? Huh?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-I
FREAKING SEE!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Dramatic
much?&quot; Lemmy laughed until the cabbie pulled out a shotgun, SS
HQ engraved on the metal barrel, aimed across his lap and out of the
window. He quickly shoved it away. &quot;You can't shoot my brother!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;It's
the others,&quot; he spat, his face a deep fuchsia.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;What
are they cops? I'm legally here and not Ludwig. Why are they working
with instead of arresting him?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The pink
boo groaned, exasperated. &quot;Alright. They're enemy spies!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
rolled his eyes. &quot;Does everybody have to lie today? Here,&quot;
He grabbed the shotgun. &quot;I have no qualms if this will get me
home quicker.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Kid,
what are ya doing-?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
cocked the gun twice the length of him. &quot;Shooting the 'enemy
spies',&quot; he quipped, sticking his head out of the window.
&quot;Luddy, duck!&quot; He fired repeatedly, shells popping out and
bouncing on the road behind them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">On the
river, Ludwig fell backward on deck, the other two crouching with
him. Bullets rippled the water, striking the hull. Only then did the
blue haired koopaling notice that there were steel reinforcements
lining the sides, deformed inwards now. There were other items
stashed down there he didn&rsquo;t heed earlier, clothes in a
cryogenically sealed bag, a picnic basket with grenades hidden under
the flap, a completely metal suitcase with a thumbprint reader that
was disabled and replaced with a normal lock at some point, and a
silver pistol with a shopping tag stating &lsquo;Not a gun&rsquo;.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
should have been armed like I desired,&rdquo; the noki hissed,
tossing away her umbrella. &ldquo;But nooo a madame like me only
needs to zit and look pretty!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lady,
it-a would have not made a difference with what they&rsquo;re-a
packin!&rdquo; The human sent her a nasty look before manning the
bow. His top hat was blasted away in the firefight, revealing golden
brown hair and pointed ears. More shockingly however, the cab was
over the horizon. &ldquo;Ah, I-a had it under control. We can beach
here and track them-a on foot.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The noki
resigned to his suggestion, crossing one leg over and folding her
arms, confounding Ludwig regarding their overtly casual reaction.
They drift against the bank. The noki and human hopped over board and
barreled across the mud and reeds, not minding their expensive formal
clothing. The man had shed his dress coat and the lady her hair bows
and jewelry.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
have forgotten something.&rdquo; Ludwig stepped out of the gondola
and into the soggy soil and rushes, revealing the &lsquo;not gun&rsquo;
in a cheeky fashion. He had his own zapper, but this one was
weightier, formidable.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oui
Monsieur Koopa, because it is not a gun,&rdquo; she said, just a tiny
bit like he was a daft.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Correct.
Not not a gun,&rdquo; Ludwig reiterated as they crossed the street.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No.
He-a needs to throw that-a back. It&rsquo;s-a not not not a gun.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
concur!&rdquo; Ludwig swung it around a finger.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You&rsquo;re-a
still holding it!.. It&rsquo;s not not.. Get rid of it!&rdquo; They
yelled at once.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
surrender. Very well.&quot; He smirked and did no such thing as they
entered an uncharted dense forest, land that was not on the Poshley
city map. He soon understood why when he plucked a real estate
development sign from the ground. He hid his reaction to the
strangers, the maelstrom of emotions it shot through him, and regrets
of yesterday crushing him. It sapped his somewhat optimistic feelings
he had prior. Back on the boat, he'd combated one of those 'glitches'
Geno warned about. His vision dimmed with familiarity, the faint
geometric shape returned, however he bit his tongue, rather hard, and
it beget control over his soul again.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">(Bonjour.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
blinked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">(I'm a
different French noki, a third and unwitting passenger in the taxi
you seek. You're with Jellien are you not? Excuse me, Maria. Don't
let her inflection trick you. We are French as in from Maple Treeway,
not as in 'we live in view of the Awful Tower')</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
itched the back of his neck where it pinged from. So desensitized at
this point, every word channeled to his brain had unchallenged
verity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">(.. I am
not replete. Tell them M jammed his transponder. They need to..
Search.. Three miles to every degree..)</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
relayed that out of the blue. The two looked at him incredulously.
Ludwig decided to convince them with the pistol. Now they treated it
like a real gun.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Free from
harassment as the road distanced from that river, Lemmy could try to
enjoy the good parts of classic land yacht style kart. Aside from the
rattling, sputtering, and smoke spewing that reminded him of a short
lived clunker Roy owned because he thought he was a mechanic briefly,
it had deep cushions, so much that without a booster seat he had to
consciously lean up to properly sight see. There was a courtyard
filled with red trumpet shaped Amaryllis flowers leading to stone
patios for outside dining. Statues of mushroom people were spaced
perfectly apart. Then there were fairgrounds, with actual toads
there, some on a carousel, the Ferris wheel, and at stands getting
colorful balloons. It was a dignified occasion with only adults
despite what looked like a ton of fun to Lemmy. That led to an entire
palace the shape of Peach&rsquo;s Castle, identical color scheme, if
doubled in floors and with a golden gate surrounding it instead of a
drawbridge. The stained glass in the front had the Mushroom Crest,
the same for the flags flapping from poles on the spires. </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What.
The. Heck.</font></em> <font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Secret
Mushroomite territory, not on any Koopa Troop maps. It might be
dangerous with them veering off road, squashing some traffic cones.
More nuts and bolts flung off. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Umm,
this way kinda sucks..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Just
a detour kid.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Rigidly
seated, Lemmy saw a mound of that red dirt that meant construction
was going on. They crossed cranes and tractor trailers. A plethora of
roll off dumpsters were filled with recently cleared brush. There was
a huge yellow Earth mover next to a deep trench that wrapped around
some land that already had parts of a foundation laid. There was a
tube going down it, the other end disappearing into the forest.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">To
where?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
lake.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
lake?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You&rsquo;re
right. Probably not much of it left. Should still be deep enough,
hehe.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
wrapped around another corner, where Lemmy located that tube again at
a clearing. The cab pulled up slowly to what would have been a lake,
now a basin with a smaller but still deep amount of blue shimmering
water at the bottom.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The cabbie
parked with a crazy smirk. &ldquo;Ya might wanna get out, hehe.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
muttered &lsquo;drats&rsquo;. &ldquo;Seriously? I shot at so-called
spies, bruised my index finger, my ears sorta ring now, and we gotta
stop here? Is this because I don&rsquo;t know my pin to pay you for
the mileage so far?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The smile
dropped. &ldquo;What?!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
koopaling laughed nervously. &ldquo;That.. Yeah I forgot that I never
knew the pin in the first place because it&rsquo;s Ludwig&rsquo;s
card.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The pink
boo lunged over and choked the koopaling out. Lemmy was panicked
and.. Surprised it took this long really. He did it right back until
they were mutually blue in the face. The cabbie, older and slightly
out of shape but brawny, wasn't giving up without his fare, and
Lemmy, highly athletic despite his waifish arms, wasn't either. He
didn&rsquo;t have a check book so he kinda had to win this or else.
Off to the side, picked up by his lazy eye, Lemmy saw three folks
coming at them.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Okaytimeout!&rdquo;
he ground out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They let
go, gulping for air. Lemmy recovered quicker, utilizing that
armistice to replay it all with the little bit of oxygen in his
brain. His determination to get away from Ludwig clouded his
judgment. This couldn&rsquo;t be a real cab.. He&rsquo;d never shared
where he wanted to go! He whipped out his phone and texted his bff,
at least he hoped.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">W-what
cha doing now k-kid?&rdquo; the pink boo growled hoarsely, holding
his scruffy neck.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
pointed a thumb backwards. &ldquo;Umm. Telling my brother to leave me
alone. See? See? Huh? Huh? See him?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Freaking
kid!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No
really.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The cabbie
gaped at the view of his side mirror. He scrambled to shift them into
drive. Lemmy realized what was happening and clasped onto the
cabbie&rsquo;s hand mashing the pedal extender for legless drivers,
too late to stop the tires from spinning in the loose soil. They were
going into the pit-</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The trio
didn&rsquo;t know what to expect following the blip on the radar all
through land adjacent to the territory of the Mushroom King. When
they burst out of the greenery and found the cab less than twenty
feet away from that lake, it became deathly clear. Before they were
on it, the car jetted off.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mon
dieu!&rdquo; The noki cried into the human&rsquo;s bosom, the most
genuine emotion Ludwig had seen yet.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Got
it covered, madame.&rdquo; The koopaling parted through the two and
fired the pistol, aiming for the wheels. There was a bang as a long
hook was fired, looping around the bumper. After a split second, he
knew what was happening. The cable was running out with the vehicle
less than five feet away.. &ldquo;Grab on!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The noki&rsquo;s
hands clutched his waist and the human hers. The trio were yanked
forward as the cable stretched taut. The bottom frame violently tore
off into the basin, leaving the hooked chassis to plop down and hang
half over the edge. Ludwig was panged sick seeing his brother beat
against the back windshield. The only doors were hanging in the air
and the bumper was warping in the middle. This squeezed the frame in
a way that the trunk area went convex. A small hand came out, felt
around, then pressed a button next to the keyhole, popping it open.
Another noki crept out, lessening the weight but not enough, in a
Hawaiian shirt, belling to their feet weakly. He&rsquo;d been beaten,
even bound judging by deep red scars in his wrists and ankles.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Why
is 0064 like-a this?&rdquo; The human grunt.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
is an in denial diabetic, zhat&rsquo;s pretended to be 35 for the
last few years..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
lightbulb went off. &ldquo;Madame, there&rsquo;s a disgustingly sugar
rich snack in my pocket!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She felt
Ludwig up, the koopaling detecting in the corner of his vision
jealous eyes on him. Oh cut him a break! &ldquo;Other pocket woman..&rdquo;
She located the protein bar from the train, dropping it into the male
noki&rsquo;s limp hand. He sluggishly took a bite, through the
package. Like he was struck with a bolt of lightning, he launched to
his feet. Ludwig knew those trashy things were lab experiments gone
wrong! He made one extra tug on the rope. With a dirt flinging
scrape, the sedan was scraped off the ledge. As everyone behind the
male noki collapsed over each other, Lemmy tumbled out of the hoopty
with a busted lip, some whiplash and sparkly glass shards coating
him.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Guys..
That was AWFUL! So glad I didn&rsquo;t prepay..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The male
noki pulled Lemmy up by the plastron. &ldquo;I am Detective Bond.
Where is M?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Huh?
..Oh. Well he wasn&rsquo;t wearing a seat belt sooo.&rdquo; Lemmy
shrugged. &ldquo;Click it or ticket, right?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Upon
closer inspection, the front windshield was shattered. Bond dove to
his knees, obsessively peering down the basin for traces of the pink
boo until the other noki and human pulled him away.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Mon
fr&egrave;re! M can evanesce at will. Let it go.&quot; As he
reluctantly stood with her, they were the same height and favored
greatly in proximity. They embraced, kissed on the cheek, then pulled
apart. She then ventured with some venom, &quot;Now what put YOU here
so zat we had to help you out of la prision?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond had a
flash of guilt, evident on his round sunglasses free face. &quot;Does
it matter ?&quot; He shifted around her. &quot;Did my brother in law
know 0088 sabotaged that cake? Or did you?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
scoffed, slapping him. &quot;As if!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Well
it would not be the first time you've tried to kill me. I still have
that scar from being dangled off of a skyscraper!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
forgot my anniversary.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;And
why would I celebrate that when you two have been meaning to divorce
for a decade?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hey!&quot;
Waldo, the human barged in. &quot;..It's-a complicated.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oui.&quot;
His sister and her husband cornered Jelectro. &quot;It's Agent N,
isn't it? Did he know you were apprehended? No warrant from HQ sayz
not! He should know now mon fr&egrave;re, for zhat Sirena Beach you
were at is no more!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bond's
fists balled. &quot;Aye aye aye! Jeremy's sick niece drew me to Toad
Town early. Nothing else. Not our elections coming up. Not even that
dog Jeremy and I were going to adopt. HQ is turning on me because
Charles is threatened. Like such internal politics matter when we are
dealing with Bowser's Mushroom Flu! Where did his kids go anyway?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy and
Ludwig had silently backed to the construction zone where workers in
hardhats forced them to dive behind a dumpster.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Once those
toad feet had shuffled away, Lemmy knew what needed to be done. He
was picking up a habit of giving up, the antithesis of a decent Koopa
Troop represented. &quot;I'm sorry I ran off like that... Oh my God,&quot;
he sighed out. &quot;Last night you were acting possessed or whatever
when you hunted down Zoo, stole his bell, and rang it. That's when
all heck broke loose. Since then I just.. didn't want to believe this
kinda stuff was real.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
slid downwards against the metal paneling to the ground. &quot;If
that was disorienting to witness, imagine being the subject! I am
held together by Rosalina's Gravitational Pull and will go nowhere
until my mission is complete.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
stood around, anxiously. &quot;.. What's gonna happen to you
afterwards? Will you be dead dead?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;For
once.. I don't know.&quot; He flipped through the lexicon they'd
purchased, fighting against crisp pages. &quot;Are you with me
regardless? I cannot do this without you! That is the sole reason
I've let Wendy O. take prominence and placate our family, comrades,
and associates who are infinitely entrenched in their ways, and
certainly will not be inclined to assist until, I fear, irreparable
damage is done.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
tried to accept that, focusing on a picket sign with the layout of
Peach's future new castle. Now that was certainly bizarre, especially
where the King wanted to place the garden. If on the side instead of
the front, it could be easily invaded. He'd know by experience.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;We
can't hide forever. Where should we go now, Luddy?&quot;<br/>
&quot;-He
should go right about.. in our custody!&quot; Jelectro snatched his
cold arm towards him, far stronger than he appeared. The three spies
had snuck up on them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Waldo
secured Lemmy in the air. &ldquo;What the heck did we do? I wasn&rsquo;t
with that boo! I mean I know I shot at you and Ludwig is responsible
for the Mushroom Flu but..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy,&rdquo;
Ludwig murmured.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hold
on, show them the special memento you were given.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The blue
haired koopaling lifted his head, rife with perplexity, &ldquo;It
is.. In my shell.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jelectro
huffed, realizing he was forced to play along with this obvious ploy.
Alarmingly his more rookie agents were buying it. &ldquo;Maria,
verify.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Read
what it says from his mind.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ha
ha ha, no..&rdquo; He flushed. &ldquo;Do not be silly, petite soeur.
Check.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">NO!&rdquo;
Waldo snapped. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t-a want her touching him again.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Aye
aye aye!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
brothers winked. At this rate they estimated they could hold them for
hours. It was even physically affecting Jelectro they thought at
first as he grimaced, releasing Ludwig.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His sister
had to catch him. &ldquo;I am not loco. He has done zhat all our life
and he tries to deny every time zhat he is like our parents Hot Foot
and Pokey who had the ability to-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Run
from here..&rdquo; Jelectro muttered.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Everyone
was shaken off their feet by the quake. Birds flew from trees all
over, metal and machinery clanged, and in the distance toad workers
screamed and fled. Water gushed from the pipe siphoning water into
the new moat, broken and spewing it over the flat ground. They
scattered. Behind them the torrent lifted everything in seconds, from
the toads, to all but the heaviest equipment, swept away with the
flow. Ludwig and Lemmy stuck together sprinting across the street. A
car honked, narrowly missing them. They kept going through a riparian
zone, wadding the river, then through red flower fields, the ground
practically bouncing them along. They became tangled up with each
other and rolled down hill, smacking against something solid...</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
opened his eyes, staring at a fifteen or twenty foot statute of a
human woman, in a dress. She had ringlets and a pouty expression,
hands clasped in front of a brooch on her dress. What did it remind
him of?</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
koopaling, eh?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Two!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It
is! Ruuunnn!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toads had
already abandoned the courtyard patios and fair rides when the
earthquake began. Upon finding them it became a frenzy. An alarm
sounded from hidden speakers and fake rocks. Behind golden gates,
guards were spilling out of two red doors of the palace. In the
stained glass there was a silhouette of a man. No doubts about who it
was.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So
eni mist..&rdquo; Ludwig turned to Lemmy sprawled out beside him.
&ldquo;This is a grave mistake!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
lifted up woozily, paling at the sight of the guards swinging open
the gates. He checked his now shattered phone again. &ldquo;No. I
mean yes, but.. Up here. Quick!&rdquo; He vaulted up to the statue's
elbow. &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
reached his arms out. &ldquo;Some assistance?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
yeah..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
hauled him up as Mushroom guards charged through all of the flowers,
ripping the roots up in haste. About thirty gathered at the base of
that statue and raised their super scopes, but could not pull the
trigger, not at the image of Peach&rsquo;s mother.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Do
you have your zapper?&rdquo; Lemmy asked, anxiously.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He&rsquo;d
already fired at him, so what Lemmy wanted made Ludwig apprehensive.
Nevertheless, &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Shoot
in the sky. I think that&rsquo;s the problem.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
know I don&rsquo;t deserve it, but trust me!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
plugged an ear and expended its shots in the sky. The guards below
flinched, then loaded. Now Ludwig was sure they&rsquo;d proceed to
blast them away regardless. If not them, it might be the dots in the
distance, toads on the palace roof with long range super scopes, or
perhaps he might lose balance and break his own neck on the figure&rsquo;s
sloped and narrow shoulders- Or that rocket heading their way would
do them in.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It soared
over their heads the first time, then rounded back, firing a blue
beam at them. Ludwig became weightless as the entirety of Poshley
Heights and its devastation, crumbled buildings, glass coating the
streets, pedestrians amok, a train derail, scrolled blisteringly fast
one hundred beneath their floating toes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Kon'nichiwa,
Luddy and Lemmy-sama! Fascinating place. Took a while since they'd
censored coordinates from Boogle Maps, but I know that signal
anywhere. You guys will totally be in the news, though. I didn't have
time to fire lasers at their recording equipment.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;We
already were.&quot; Ludwig having not seen the cyborg side of Iggy
yet, he was excited, impressed, and afraid at once of the
possibilities. For instance there was no wind or sensation of forward
propulsion, the tractor beam suspending them. &quot;Are there any
adverse side effects to this method of travel?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;It
might dislodge items from your pockets. Don't let it be your wallet,
okay? And let's goooo!&quot; Iggy Delta saluted.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Being able
to 'fly' in a way, Lemmy in fact held his arms out like a bird, the
two elder siblings grinned at each other quite stupidly. Ludwig knew
he'd always have Lemmy and Lemmy Iggy and Iggy-</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-My
sensors are picking up a new friend half a light year away. Hang
tight.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;...Is
he a cop or secret agent or something?&quot; Lemmy paled. &quot;Sorta..
burned out on that.&quot; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Nononono!..
Wait, yeah but, wait..I can totally explain!!!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Meanwhile,
engines went into turbo, blasting them up higher. Ludwig could have
sworn there was a divide in the shrinking Earth, as if a cosmic
scythe ran across the land masses in a perfect line. He was
distracted shortly by something escaping his hammerspace pockets. He
had to save that memento, the original business card of the Council
of Conscientious Villainy signed by its founder who abandoned the
project after one day, the curiously named 'Clarentine Koopa'&hellip;</font></p>

-Z.A.S.</font></em>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
advisory failed to thwart Millennium Star, confident in his
safeguarding purple aura. The ancient one had but one regret visiting
the Dark Realm, the deepest channel of the universe. Leaving Rosalina
in the lurch was rude and unbecoming, his marginal interpersonal
skills escalating with the situation. As the Lord and inventor of
time, when he promised an errand would only take a &lsquo;split
second&rsquo; it was for others an hour, week, year or eon..
Hopefully not this time..</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His
destination was nearly invisible against the dense clouds of dark
matter pervading the sector. Argentine and reddish rutile spires rose
from the planetoid, a protective hedge around a pure black sun
temple. Upon landing a safe distance from that appalling sight,
Millennium Star was certain the occupant was not in. No traps
activated, no agony generators emerged, the occupant&rsquo;s pet
Underchomp did not roam, audibly confined underground and lashing
against some colossal chains.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">If that
crafty devil was not here, where else? The Dark Ztar was, as few
believed due to his unsavory character and reputation, a close
relative to a Star Spirit. Might that be enough? What might that give
him access to unique to other star beings?</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A floating
arrow platform brought the brown skinned white bearded toad in an
orange and gold trimmed robe, King Ed of Sky Land, from his opulent
marble castle in the cirrus clouds to the lowest where soldiers were
stationed. It had been difficult to call them to coalesce and
excruciating to sweep over them afterwards knowing some may be lost.
The toads were like his family, the dearth of blood relatives why his
weakness was seeking Elysium. A whistleblower on land under the
pseudonym of &lsquo;999&rsquo; made a vague promise of working
something out. An ember of hope then, as of now too late.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He twisted
his scepter to suspend the chief officer from sounding the horn,
taking one last look at his Tower of Lyribiris, disfigured with a
twenty mile perimeter into a Koopa Troop stronghold. They had the KT
outnumbered 5000 to the 1000 his lookouts tallied, though the King&rsquo;s
people possessed only a helmet, parachute, and spear vs formidable
cannons, hammers, and other ghastly innate capabilities. True, Water
Land utilized a near identical loadout on their comparatively wimpish
toads, swapping parachutes with snorkels, to blot out King Morton and
his monstrous koopa clan half a century ago, but K. Ed was not half,
or even a quarter of the king Omarinon was down there. After all, K.
Ed allowed this in the first place by leaving his terrestrial half of
the kingdom unguarded! He had no other lands aligned with him,
Bowser&rsquo;s hectic pace ahead of news reports for once. As far as
most other kingdoms knew, Bowser was hiding somewhere with the
Mushroom Kingdom&rsquo;s princess and chancellor captive following
that freak thunderstorm in Dark Land.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well, time
to add a hailstorm to it. Unwavering, King Ed gave the signal. His
warriors charged under the horn blast.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A pale
green shelled koopa troopa jumped, his suitcase dropping to the
weathered wooden deck with a clack. The only of his kind in the sea
of pionpi, he turned his head.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Theodore!!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
corners of his thin lips arched downward. At the crowded dock of
Surfshine Harbor, a luxurious steam liner prepared to board
passengers. A motley bunch weaved around the residents or travelers
at the shore beach houses to meet him. The toad ladies had mismatched
shirts, pants, and shoes, the shy guy wore a baggy green hoodie
covering his blue garb, and the whomp a tan trench coat and newsboy
cap.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Nass T.
wound a fist back, just like she&rsquo;d imagined doing countless
times at this point. He caught it, a touch tighter than necessary,
and closed the distance by a step, kissing the back of her palm.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
knew we&rsquo;d rendezvous. It&rsquo;s scheduled for Chai Kingdom,
not the slum parts either, ripe for harvesting.&rdquo; He leaned in,
his breath tingling her ear. &ldquo;Poorer record keeping and they
lack those pesky laws.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bob-omb
sailors of The Princess Peach began to shout, &ldquo;All aboard!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He pulled
away, eyes narrowing. &ldquo;Sounds alright? Alright.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Theo,&rdquo;
she mewled. &ldquo;Not again. We are some of the only doctors that
know about the- &lsquo;MF&rsquo;. You once cured it!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His smile
sank quicker than a thwomp in the Great Sea. &ldquo;And Miss Nasir,
have you the tenacity to waltz back into MK East? I presume you
welcome the gallows.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No,
I.. W-was suggesting-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Replacing
you will be arduous, not impossible. Good luck pleading for mercy
from my dear &lsquo;Sweet Pea&rsquo;. Your funeral. The rest of you,
make a decision. Quickly.&rdquo; He lifted his suitcase. &ldquo;Like
the sailor boys said, get movin&rsquo;. I will not dither,&rdquo; he
muttered unequivocally.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Flatlining,
Nass watched the man who had slathered decades of her once exemplary
life with corruption stroll away. Azul expectantly looked to Dr.
Terrace. He rose a thick eyebrow to Mariam. The older toad woman
became the first to spring at the proposal.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Nass
gasped. &ldquo;Mariam!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;m
so sorry dearie,&rdquo; she cried into her sleeve. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
not for anyone to understand.. I am.. Not what I appear and I can&rsquo;t
make it with any other troupe. Farewell.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Azul
pressed forward. &ldquo;Did I tell anyone I&rsquo;m on the
do-not-hire registry? It&rsquo;s like the do-not-call one, except you
don&rsquo;t wanna mix them up,&rdquo; he joshed, poorly covering up
hesitation. &ldquo;And it's time I stop burdening mom..&rdquo; he
tacked on seriously.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr.
Terrace let out a weighty sigh. &ldquo;With my petrified joints, I'll
try to supervise those two. Don&rsquo;t worry doll, I&rsquo;ll cajole
Theo into something useful too..&rdquo; He waddled onward.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Disappointment
rolled over Nass like the water on the shore. During the escape from
Poshley Heights, through thrift store dumpsters, in taxies, and
darting down dark alleys, the mantra that they&rsquo;d not split was
the most common after, &lsquo;my feet hurt&rsquo;. The steam liner
drifted away, passengers lingering on deck to bid farewell to the
land dwellers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">This was
rock bottom. A fugitive. Her daughter rumored to work for Bowser.
Admittedly terrible prospects. By some inner strength dormant for
years however, she was among those waving on the beach to the
departing ship. Camera flashes went off. Resentment would not debase
her further. Her crew, except Dr. Professor, waved back from the
stern. Fitting, she didn&rsquo;t know him anymore.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Drawing
away, another Koopa was watching. Pink shelled, she fought against
the crowd to trace the orange toad woman slipping behind beach homes
and avoiding the surveillance heavy dock offices. The koopa returned
to the unmarked kart with a human in it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Well?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
Koopa frowned, checking her camera. &quot;Lost her, and the others
are sailing away!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Groaning,
Inspector Douglas bopped his head against the wheel in a childish, to
her, tantrum. What did he expect? No spunk. Late on the draw. She was
missing her collaboration with a certain noki. She'd even take his
boss Snifit Patrol who never landed back on Earth. If there was
anyone aside from Luigi who could connect to Booigi the Second, it
would have been Nass, and they&rsquo;d bungled that up.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wendy&rsquo;s
friends were like scattering ants from a flattened anthill dispersing
around the Koopa Troop. The jolt that shot through the minions upon
noticing was, appropriately, as if those ants had entered their
shells. The princess and Toadsworth were pressed onward and Bowser
Junior to act &lsquo;normal n junk&rsquo;. Larry amidst that chaos
made a strenuous climb to the top level of Bowser Tower. His palm
caught every little bump on the iron rails.. The sound of his own
footsteps were earsplitting. The staircase stretched out in his mind.
All this torment because it was integral to.. tattle on himself!
Kinda. Without specifics. Sticking to carefully selected truths would
protect everyone better than his bad lies . &lsquo;Man up&rsquo; the
fifteen-year-old kept repeating.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">BAM!</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Halfway up
a mega goomba and wiggler in bright yellow jumpsuits shuffled
downstairs.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Felt
a bump.. Did I lose my wallet again?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Only
your dignity, Richard.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Oh
shut it, Wiggs! It&rsquo;s Jimmy that takes these anonymous tips,
wastin our time rolling in and they&rsquo;re like, &lsquo;huh? I feel
fine, whatcha talking about? How did you find me again?&rsquo;&rdquo;
The goomba&rsquo;s boomy voice bounced around. &ldquo;Yeah, bet cha
remember the free ride we gave ya yesterday!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ah.
Bowser currently owes more than ten thousand coins to us by now. Woe
to him!&rdquo; the wiggler mused.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
peeled himself from the floor, shook it off, and zipped back outside.
A Mushroom Kingdom Disease Control Unit truck had miraculously
appeared, unmolested by Bowser minions more occupied with Anti-Ma
rebels running around.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
stood next to the tall vehicle. &ldquo;Hey, wait up!-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Who&rsquo;s
jabbering?&rdquo; The paratroopa in the passenger spot scratched his
head.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
grabbed on and did a pull-up, struggling so that the top half of his
head was in the window. &ldquo;Erg.. Me!.. Darn it, shoulda worked
out.. more.. Please. Watch for..Kamek and Kammy!!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Parabilly&rsquo;s
ballpoint gave false starts on the pad. He tapped. Tried again.
Tapped. Larry&rsquo;s heart thumped, muscles burning.. &ldquo;Spell
it, chile?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
dropped to the ground and nimbly fogged up the oversized mirror to
write the names out. His jumpiness made it sloppy so it took three
attempts. On the last, Sebastian in the driver&rsquo;s seat hung up
the CB radio.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Transport

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
are we waiting for? Git on it!&rdquo; bellowed their leader in the
back.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The truck
left the fifteen-year-old in the dust. There was no Eldstar! His
nightmares intensified. Bowser was in the tower doorway, whipping
left and right at the madness, clawing through his hair.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">WHAT&rsquo;S
GOING ON?!?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After an
anxious pause, &ldquo;I was just finna tell you dad. So.. the keys
got mixed up-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-GAAAAHH!&rdquo;
Bowser raged, his breath of sulfur. &ldquo;I knew a shoulda converted
to electronic locks by now! Good work telling me, erm, what I already
knew. I appreciate cha!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
shrugged. &ldquo;Yeah yeah.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Really,
son. I mean it!&rdquo; He ruffled his son&rsquo;s limp blue hair, its
natural state without hair gel. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be RIGHT OUT! I
only need to do something..&rdquo; He whisked himself back in.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
balled his fists, fed up with that propitiatory shtick. What was he
supposed to do, preen? If this might be his last day in this dark
abyss of a life called the Koopa Troop, he wanted to spill his guts.
He barged inside. Bowser Tower ground level was the last to dry out
and thus empty. He found Bowser immediately in the alcove under the
stairway. That dumbphone was to his ear, rigidly in his hands,
tapping a foot. He left a voicemail:</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey
Mario, give me a little longer. This new kingdom&rsquo;s.. taking a
while to set up according to my demented dreams if ya know what I
mean. This isn&rsquo;t because I&rsquo;ve just lost Peach right now
or nothing so no rushing here, alright?-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dad.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
jumped, hiding it behind his back. &ldquo;..Yeah! He is awesome. Me.
Uh, what.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He folded
his arms. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t believe that back there! I'm tired of
only having a tiny scrap of your appreciation and attention and
stuff, whatever's left after you&rsquo;ve spilled it out on the rest.
I&rsquo;ve always seen through this fake training crap. Us koopalings
were screwed from the start because Junior looks like you. That&rsquo;s
why you&rsquo;ve designated him successor!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
expected some retaliation, a stomp that could pound rock to sand,
fire that could melt steel, or at least the classic butt whooping.
Instead, Bowser&rsquo;s jaw hung a bit. His large clawed hands
clasped as he bent, whispering in an unheard of way. &ldquo;Larry, if
I show you something, will you promise to not try to leave?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Not sure
how else to respond, a hushed, &ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; escaped his lips.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
followed his father, mystified, all the way into the throne room. The
teen stood in the middle and looked around at the countless graph
papers on the floor, marked with notes or sketches of anti-plumber
traps. Bowser carefully retrieved the lapis bust of a chipped up
dragon koopa scowling, like it felt the dilapidation of the lordly
effigy. Larry couldn&rsquo;t place where he&rsquo;d seen it before in
their old castle, a relative clearly. Like Bowser except with shorter
horns, a smaller tuft of hair, and beadier eyes.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Soooo.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;That
funny name Junior has.. It was an impulse move, 'cause he doesn't
look like me. He looks like my brother here. I think sometimes he
shoulda been king instead. I know I know but... it happens at my
lowest points.&quot; Bowser placed it back on the shelf with his
other one of two things and backed away with slow steps.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Time froze
for the teen, it utterly surreal that, no, his father was not always
perfectly boisterous and confident. The sort of guy those annoying
Red-Megavitemin pill gurus Roy or Morton listened to on podcast were
trying to be. To withstand so much rejection he had to be made of
diamond or something. Right? Uh ...</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
perked up. &ldquo;You hear running water? &hellip;I bet it&rsquo;s
gramps, old hag, and that sauna they set up! They&rsquo;d better SAVE
some water! A lotta minions are gonna want showers at the end of the
day!! Sit tight.&rdquo; Bowser ran off.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry had
a gap in his memory regarding being outside again. It might have been
to find someone, anyone, to share this with for a reality check, the
haze continuing to obscure him until he was at the skeleton of
Junior&rsquo;s fortress site. Something was off, and it wasn&rsquo;t
Larry for once. It rocked in rhythm with the hammering inside and
shaped like a malformed box, parts not joining correctly. He flushed,
knocking heavily on the shut door. No one heard him. He knocked
harder. Then it flopped like a stack of cards! Larry bolted from the
scene, his old inclinations rushing back. Where was his unofficial
partner in crime, Wendy? He whipped out his phone..</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Minions
abandoned their tools to pursue escapees. A boomerang bro rebel held
the lead by several paces losing his trilby as he fled for his life.
A magikoopa in blue and purple, hood down and holding the hems of the
robes to not trip, broke off from the KT pack alongside some newly
installed barbed wire fencing. A truck zoomed past them dazzlingly.
They thought they&rsquo;d imagined it until it careened into the last
barrier of the Koopa Troop, smashing apart the wooden barricade. It
proceeded onward into the adjacent Kingdom, creating a spot that all
the rebels began to aim for.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The purple
&lsquo;magikoopa&rsquo; spontaneously dropped back from the other.
</font><em>&ldquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Princess
Toadstool, we should not use that shortcut. Fancy this..&rdquo;</font></em></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
directed her to swap sides, so that she was closest to the fence. The
princess turned her head subtly to avoid revealing her face. Three
mega monty moles held that section of the fencing upward, with five
more diligently installing support beams. The small ones pressed
their ears to the ground and scurried away. The giant ones followed,
and the section plummeted. Peach narrowly avoided the heavy iron
barrier with a frantic drive. A wicked cackle followed, like that of
someone very familiar but distorted.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She hauled
herself up, &ldquo;Toadsworth?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Indeed,
you blithering fool,&rdquo;</font></em> <font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadsworth&rsquo;s
magikoopa garb slumped off his figure, revealing grey toned skin as
he pushed her towards the downed fence, the algid nature of his tiny
yet secure grip startling her as much as his attitude. Her left leg
scraped against a sharp barb.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
was almost pinned! Stop this!&rdquo; She was locked by his blackened
pupils. &ldquo;What in heavens has gotten into you?!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Not
in heavens. On Earth.. At least now!&rdquo;</font></em> <font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">he
growled like some rabid animal.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">E-excuse
me??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><em>&rdquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Th.i.s
i.sn&rsquo;..t. .n.e.w?&rdquo; </font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
being in the shape of Toadsworth spoke, not even attempting to
approximate mortal speech anymore. </font><em>&ldquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">.W.e..&rsquo;ve

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
princess shuddered in its frigid grasp. It toyed with her, her tongue
all but withered and dry, lodged against the roof of her mouth. The
chill crept up her arms, to her shoulders, down to her midsection, to
her toes, stuffed in koopa issued boots. Her skin bleached like
alabaster. The moisture in her eyes began to congeal. Her soul was
draining.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-A company
of builders barged into them, severing the fatal grapple. While most
didn&rsquo;t stop, Roy stooped to his knees, panting from their
evacuation of the fortress. Morton arrived last, carrying people
under his arms. He propped both down.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
saved Iggster! Oh and.. Junior. I daresay. But Iggster looks great.
Refreshed. Better! Best!&rdquo; &lsquo;Iggy&rsquo;, flat as ever, was
equally blithesome, contrasting Bowser Junior, blushing and clenching
his backpack tightly at Peach and Toadsworth. Roy noticed who they&rsquo;d
trampled. He yanked the limp princess upwards.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
heck dey doing here dressed like that? Especially old Mctoadyface,
he&rsquo;s blue!&rdquo; The pink koopaling slid his sunglasses down
for a better look at steadily growing dots in the sky. His seldom
seen purple iris dilated for a second. &ldquo;Nevermind. Run for da
hills! Go take em, Mort.&rdquo;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Our
Amazone Prima Guide delivery of the struts shoulda been somewhere, I
dun get it,&rdquo; Thwomp #3 mumbled.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
negativistic balaclava wearing elite soldier of Bowser jabbed him in
the back, having been led away from Bowser Tower and into fields of
leafy nothingness. &ldquo;But it ain&rsquo;t. THERE&rsquo;S NOTHING
FREAKIN HERE!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thwomp #3
pivoted around. There was an unmistakable but fleeting spark behind
his red eyes and perpetually disgruntled face. &ldquo;Dat thing is.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sentry 11
found a forty-four feet tall and four feet wide obelisk planted on
top the hill, like a void cut out in the universe, no visible
texture. His cloud sunk a few inches. Not being there when he
surveyed this quadrant earlier made its unannounced appearance
phobogenic. Enough distractions. He let himself fall for this trick
to nail that concrete bug. Thwomp sounded like a KT, looked it, and
had the tattoo branded on a spike, but he&rsquo;d inadvertently
mentioned once that Bowser&rsquo;s old address was &lsquo;444 Dark
Drive&rsquo;. That was common knowledge to </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mushroom
Freaks</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">.
No actual resident of Dark Land remembered aside from Bowser himself.
Secondly-</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hold
it, soldier.&rdquo; Sentry 11 shook the thwomp violently, making a
half dozen L shaped struts for a fortress tumble out of his pockets.
&ldquo;Now what&rsquo;s that?!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
dunno!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Recite

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">As
a child of the stars, I shall cite none of you in vain-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The sentry
sliced across his neck, grinning deviously. &ldquo;-Dead. You recited
THEIR version. Ours, under the same name, see, got cha, is about our
sworn rivalry against you pests.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
thwomped closer. &ldquo;J.D., I must ascertain how you are familiar
with Mushroom curricular??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I..
studied.. four years only, in middle school. K? Bowser&rsquo;s my
idol!&rdquo; he snarled.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Your
memory may be faulty. It is astounding what putting on a brainless
grimace does to conceal your identity.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He jabbed
him again. &ldquo;Listen, Rockhead-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The thwomp
buffeted that, painfully bending back the lakitu&rsquo;s finger.
&ldquo;Lieutenant Stone. Familiar? </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
flunked you out of SS HQ training,</font></em> <font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">receiving
a different version of that tale then.&rdquo; Lt. Stone, the 9th
agent ever, sometimes tripled for stylization, became the most
brilliant slab of concrete there could be. He scanned the lakitu with
calculating red eyes, snorting at his flabbergasted expression.
&ldquo;Still off-kilter and overly emotional you appear. Hmph. To
your credit, I have inferred that being invidious is rewarded here. I
conclude you have found your place after all! &rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
trembling lakitu, in a more fight or flight reaction than intended,
cracked his knuckles. &ldquo;You are my next hit. Spy,&rdquo; he
sputtered.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
am reminded of glass houses.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And
I&rsquo;m reminded that I&rsquo;ll need a ditch in the ground big
enough to BURY YOU AFTER I-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~Halt
your warring. I need this one. Yes. That one too!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They broke
their standoff as Wendy O. appeared from behind the obelisk. The
koopaling princess glided down, holding her thumb and index fingers
together at the tips. Her tone had an ethereal quality, wholly unlike
the &lsquo;cute&rsquo; brat.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">My
dominion shall be marked. Disband.~&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">This
didn&rsquo;t happen,&rdquo; Sentry 11 said through his teeth.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Truce.
Chump.&rdquo; After one last smirk, the thwomp transfigured into a
complete idiot.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Her eyes
flared open. &ldquo;I SAID MOVE THEE!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Now that
sounded like her, accented by a deafening drone that shook them
apart.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Spawning
from the obelisk, a black impenetrable beam shot from the face at
light speed, hacking through the rest of Sky Land into the Bowser
territory, slicing Bowser Tower in half, preceding to Giant Land,
Water Land, Desert Land, Grass Land or the Mushroom Kingdom, across
the Great Sea, sticking directly one vessel, though Dark Land, Ice
Land, Pipe Land, and returning to Sky Land. Concluding its trip
around the globe, it met the opposite face of the obelisk and another
planet rattling clap, the beam and the Pillar of Understanding phased
away, leaving a gaping trench to the lowest depths imaginable.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
stumbled onto the scene, led by Wendy&rsquo;s FindMyBowserPhone app
reporting damage. Wide eyed, he turned around at the lip of the new
canyon. No one would believe him anyway.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sir,
are you concerned about-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;ll
handle questions tomorrow!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yes
sir.&rdquo; The grindel attendant left Mayor Koton in his moodily lit
office. The long curtains were closed so that the volcano nearby,
active and spouting lava today, may not blind the thwimp returning to
the proclamations on his desk.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">For some
time now, he&rsquo;d been council-weak as some say- losers that was,
the workings and the revenue flow of the overlords under him fine
tuned to not require constant intervention. Despite that it would be
naive to passively let Monday come along without brushing up on
current matters. Every four years Bowser or one of his operatives
would inform him of what smuck wanted to run against him, with a roar
of laughter to follow. The KT would never allow anyone to actually
boot him out of office. Much like the rare disease that kept him
forever a thwimp, he was destined by Kamek to forever lord over Neo
Bowser City. Without that, the intrigue of who he might be up against
had weighed on his square shoulders all morning.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">On cue,
&ldquo;-Mr. Mayor sir.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mayor
Koton stared expectantly at the whomp in the half opened doorway. He
had a blue ribbon, a Corporal, just above a toad servant.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
have confirmed Bowser operatives with information on the competing
party, sir.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Koton
lifted up and salved, visibly. &ldquo;The monitor, would you please?&rdquo;
By the time he&rsquo;d try to head down or even reach his remote with
his weak little arcs, that presentation in the foyer would be over.
Worsening health was what shut him in more often than not, and, a
painful reminder, why the unforeseen departure of Thomas Toad, one of
his best stewards, was such a blow to his regime.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The whomp
cut it on the wide screen in the office, opposite to the mayor&rsquo;s
desk.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">From the
camera in the foyer of the fortress, a thwomp ushered a koopatrol,
toad, para-goomba, and koopa troopa before office and registration
personnel. While Koton never expected Bowser himself given the damage
to his castle and the princess stealing, some unambiguously lowering
ranking mooks were a quizzical choice. They passed around some pink
flyers, filing in a line on his Darklandian crest rug, their nerves
revealed by the clinging of the koopatrol&rsquo;s armor, the rouging
of the toad girl, the goomba eyeing the exits, and the koopa keeping
his snout down.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After
dragging themselves together into a brief huddle, Emery took the leap
into the firing squad.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hi.
I know I look outta place.. But I&rsquo;m the King&rsquo;s best
soldier!&rdquo;</font></p>

<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">While she
dove into the flyer&rsquo;s proposals, some embezzled, some not,
Tanner read the letter he&rsquo;d picked up. All mail in Dark Land
funneled to one place in the city, to discourage laziness or some
drivel, and he was hankering to know what his buddy wrote.</font></p>
<p><em>&rdquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Riddle

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">One of his
jokes. Ugh, he&rsquo;d better solve it. Zoo would know upon return if
he peeked at the answer.. Hm. He got it. Zoo visited that eye doctor.

legible by some miracle.</font></p>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Folded in

</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That code
didn&rsquo;t correspond to any candidate the koopatrol recognized. A
typo? Aww, his dumb, playful, alarmingly murderous as of yesterday,
but thoughtful friend&hellip;Forgetting where he was, he pressed it
against his chest, sighing with his gaze at the amber chandeliers.
They began to sway.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Everything
surrounding Mayor Koton rattled for ten seconds, during which the
monitor snapped off the mount and shattered on the floor. The clash
of glass beckoned a toad servant into the room with a broom and pale,
followed by the same whomp imploring desperately if the mayor,
stunned in his executive chair, was okay. This Neo Bowser City
fortress was reinforced so that the foundation may not suffer
attrition from the twenty four thwomps, fifteen grindels, and ten
whomp representatives pounding, rolling or stomping around the dozen
floors all day- just not enough for this seismic event.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
private jet&rsquo;s club seating, entertainment system, and cooler of
champagne had an opposite effect for T. Yoshisaur. He couldn&rsquo;t
argue out of the overly generous provisions to his companions, the
coast guard and additionally now a black shy guy pilot they&rsquo;d
met with in Pipe Land. Now he was 10,000 miles above the Great Sea.
His son was in a pet carrier in the cargo section, it advised by the
pilot. Sonny tried to advocate for Yoshi otherwise to no avail. As
much as not being able to check on him was disquieting, Poochy had
probably fallen asleep by now, free from the influence of his
worrywart father. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Tired of
staring at the wing, the engine, or the red blinking light on the
spars, Yoshi&rsquo;s gaze settled his plastic evidence zip lock bag,
all Sonny could give him, containing the broken Bronze Egg. By
tinkering with it on and off during the trip he determined he&rsquo;d
only meld the four pieces with a gallon of Donkey Kong Glue or
professional help, like Mr. Zeror of Peach Castle or Russ T. who
retired ages ago. ..More appropriately the latter. A Bowser baddie

and its powdery dust, as it had a chatoyant onyx center under the

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Twenty
minutes till touch down!&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A toad

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I

appreciate everything so far,&rdquo; he emphasized.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No
prob. I love this job. Usually..&rdquo; The entire time Sonny played
with a canteen in his hands, a noticeable slosh within. After the
rendezvous with the pilot, the toad was frequently seen with whatever
that was, the formalness and prudence the toad held at their
introduction eroding with each sip. That decaying body in the ocean,
now packed away with their cargo for identification and autopsy was
perturbing Yoshi sympathized, but if this was his coping method,
perhaps Sonny was better away from the controls after all.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-So,
what&rsquo;s with you?&rdquo; Yoshi asked in the middle of him taking
another swig.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The toad
lowered it, face rosey. &ldquo;...Umm. Honestly. Umm.&rdquo; He
breathed out heavily. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t patrol last night like I
should have. There&rsquo;s some weird politics going on in my
&lsquo;office&rsquo; and I lingered to keep an eye on- &rsquo;the
head coast guard of Toad Town water bodies.&rsquo; I can&rsquo;t help
but wonder if I wasn&rsquo;t meddling, maybe.. I mean the tide swells
yeah but I coulda saved that guy in the tacklebox..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
cannot definitively state that.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well,
still looks bad. . I used to be an extra at a film studio with clones
of myself essentially. We filmed some </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadtanic</font></em>
<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">ripoff,
that&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;m familiar with water and rowing. For twelve
hour shifts. With only my left arm.&rdquo; The toad sat the canister
down flat. Flipped the other way, it curiously sported the label
&lsquo;Anti&rsquo;. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where the epiphany came
from, but I wanted more. I found a dodgy ad for what I do now.. &rdquo;
he trailed off vaguely. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m the weird new guy they
rib over literally everything, like my crush on Wendy O.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
flushed. &ldquo;I-interesting.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;m
19. Don&rsquo;t fret. It&rsquo;s that or they&rsquo;re wary of the
bipolar prognosis I&rsquo;ve had for a while.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
settled in the chair, not typically venturing here with just anyone.
&ldquo;..I understand. I&rsquo;m bipolar too.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-The
sequel?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So left
field, he laughed. &ldquo;No!-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Foolin..&rdquo;
He smiled back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve.. been waiting for an opportunity
to say that for an embarrassingly long time. Don&rsquo;t call me a
dork.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">To think
this would be the random thing they&rsquo;d bond over.. Yoshi didn&rsquo;t
know if he was becoming more acclimated to him in general, or it was
Sonny&rsquo;s canteen making him frolicsome (hopefully not) or a
phenomena specific to air travel he&rsquo;d yet to learn about (extra
hopefully not). The dinosaur couldn&rsquo;t stifle his giggling as he
asked genuinely, &ldquo;Not to pry, are you managing fine?&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No
worries. Just another label on me. Think it&rsquo;s worse than
&lsquo;koopaling lover&rsquo;?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Who
am I to judge? My Special One is world famous, twenty-five years
younger, and I&rsquo;m certain it won&rsquo;t be requited, nor can I
compete against the rival and his.. boisterousness.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sonny
appeared to ponder. &ldquo;...Mario? I mean with that mustache. Mhm,&rdquo;
he teased. &ldquo;Figured it out because he&rsquo;s thirty-eightish.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thirty-nine
to my sixty-four in actuality..&rdquo; Yoshi snuck in there, as if,
in his opinion, that made a difference. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t
shout that from a rooftop, perhaps you could meet Wendy one day. I
guarantee nothing. You know how girls are with their types.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The toad
flexed the bigger arm. &ldquo;Thanks. Don&rsquo;t underestimate me,
mister. I&rsquo;ll be right back.&rdquo; He sidestepped to a door in
the back, a restroom. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi was,
despite himself, drawn like a magnet to that silver canteen, not
properly sealed and leaking on the table. He stood it upwards without
thinking, some habit from being a father of an eight year old Poochy.
That was a mistake. The toad would know he&rsquo;d disturbed it now,
some all over his green fingers. It struck him, there was no smell.
Thinking back, Sonny never reeked of much except cheap cologne
despite guzzling that for a while now. Only with his super sensitive
nose did he detect fluoride. Was it chilled tap water all along?
Possibly, with one fainter aroma.. Of a chemical?-</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
scrambled to scoot away as the toad reentered the cabin. Before that
was addressed, if even noticed, there were two beeps from the cockpit
then a third, shut off prematurely by the pilot. A series of clicking
noises followed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sonny
checked his watch, eyebrows furrowing. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-What?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Nah.
Nothing!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Certain?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sure,
mister.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Floooooosh!</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Not
sure!!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A blast of
air mashed them against the back wall like Fly Guys on a sticky trap.
Cupboards burst open, unleashing papers and any other loose object as
the plane lurched downwards. Sonny, upside down, turned to his left,
or Yoshi&rsquo;s right, mouthing something during the perilous dive.
The blue curtains were blown horizontally, revealing the cockpit, the
lack of a pilot, a missing ejection seat, and the glass above that
spot gaped open! In vivid detail, the dinosaur focused on the nose
pitched at the blue sea. Then it vanished as their aircraft surged
upwards momentarily, oscillating from the warmer rising air of
southern Mushroom World clashing against colder air. Toad and yoshi
together collapsed with all of the amenities and objects. Sonny
crawled from under the pile up, scurrying up there. He secured the
control column just in time. They were low, so much that Sonny bent
at the side window and could see individual faces of the passengers
on a pink and white trimmed cruise ship limping along, partially
slashed up from some catastrophic accident. Emergency signals were
constant from the wounded vessel. The irony wasn&rsquo;t lost on the
&lsquo;coast guard&rsquo;.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
prioritized locating the cause of egress. The master caution was lit,
disabling automation. Fuel? He squinted and leaned in. Good.
Ailerons, check. Throttles. There was a gummy sort of resistance
against his forward nudge of both, preventing him from pulling the
engines out of idle. They were sinking as they crossed solid land,
the Mushroom Kingdom, famous for tall hills with eyes! As a fraction
of that adrenaline wore off, the toad noticed how heavy his muscles
felt. He pressed a button..</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mmm
mm mm mm mm!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
roused little by little under the unintelligible intercom message.
Like he&rsquo;d snapped out of some dream, he followed the roar of
wind on his hands and knees. Breaching the cockpit revealed a toad
slumped back in a co-pilot's seat so oversized for him, Yoshi had
room to slip in. The toad&rsquo;s &lsquo;stronger&rsquo; left arm
limply clung the controls, keeping them at a five degree bank,
otherwise paralyzed aside from his panicked beady eyes, darting from
Yoshi to his own appendage. Yoshi caught on, gripping the column in
the same position. Why did it smell like Lemon Candy up here? -Sonny
feebly tapped around on a low mounted Flight Management System, a
device that resembled a calculator with a VFC screen. Instead of
entering a waypoint as it was designed, he was communicating:</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">--Turn
--the-- blue-- knob --to --this --coordinate.-- You-- are --guiding
--us --down.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
gulped.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Roy
emerged from his shell and peeked through the crack in his fingers.
No, he wasn&rsquo;t scared of nuthin! When bricks fly at your face
you gotta do something.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">KABOOM!</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Another
heap of ammo going off. Pow pow pow, they went off like mines all
over the territory, delayed triggering from the earthquake. They
coulda used those! Roy&rsquo;s military calls would have shot off to
blank walls as hoards of the Koopa Troop, remaining at least, fled
across the hills to Giant Land next door, but there weren&rsquo;t
really any walls standing anymore. The handful not crumbed to bits
lay haphazardly in the field, tools were strewn about, some he
stepped on by mistake, ouch, otherwise, the chasm had swallowed it
all. If Junior&rsquo;s fortress had not buckled on itself, forcing
the work to cease, he and many others would have disappeared down the
wide trench in the Earth that split Bower Tower down the center, the
two parts laying on opposite sides. Morton would be outta his mind
like, &lsquo;the world is peeling, denuding, unraveling!&rsquo; Roy
couldn't believe he recalled some of those words. His only brother
rivaling him in size might also be, of course, useful right now! With
barely a second to comprehend the tremors that had undone all of
their hard work, dark skinned toads, native Skylandians rained on
them with tiny spears.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Roy solved
the problem. No Bowser! He barreled beyond the little toadys to the
remains of Bowser Tower, or the Tower of Lyribiris, chucking blocks
away until Sky Land soldiers closed in and dragged him away. Roy,
irately cursed so much the most hardy of those soldiers blushed. He
didn&rsquo;t get to lift the last one!</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
drifted into consciousness. There was a small crack above, the light
from it flickering as objects crossed over it, occasionally causing
pebbles to smack him in the forehead. Well, he was alive at least. He
propelled himself upwards and smacked into a heavy bulkhead, dazing
himself in the cramped pocket of space. Earlier events were like some
weird stew. -The kind Kammy might whip up with one-hundred different
ingredients because she sent their castle cook home early for the day
and desperately wanted to use her as-seen-on-tv cooking ware for once
while simultaneously wanting to punish Kamek because he kept falling
asleep as she recounted old wives tales to him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So it
didn&rsquo;t make sense. And was spicy. Wait. No, this wasn&rsquo;t
like that.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What had
he saved before his magnificent new tower disintegrated? Old scrolls?
Ancient Maps? Money? ..Something else, held rigidly against his
plastron, like he could not let go lest it float away forever.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
bulkhead shifted. Beep beep beep&hellip;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The debris
over Bowser slid away. His heart stopped. Some adventure group of
toads were standing over him and through fog, everything he&rsquo;d
built was&hellip; GONE. The Skylandians that weren&rsquo;t
celebrating &lsquo;victory&rsquo; (yeah right!) were disposing of HIS
Koopa Troop paraphernalia in the bottomless pit.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Golly!
King Bowser was here all along?&rdquo; The Captain muttered
afterwards, &ldquo;So when Mario catches up he&rsquo;ll still have
something to do, darn it..&rdquo; He snatched Yellow Toad, the only
of the Brigade without some sort of metal detector or shovel, over to
him. &ldquo;J&ouml;rg, retrieve that please.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yellow
nabbed the object in a flash, piling it on an overflowing wagon. The
effulgence of Bowser&rsquo;s brother's bust compared to those dull
chests was all Bowser could stare at.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The Koopa
King shot upwards. All but the Captain flinched. As much as he wanted
to melt them all into a puddle. He.. actually.. Thought it out. No
minions. The climate was cooler, enough to give him shivers. All the
clouds were low to the ground or gracing it, revealing more of the
kingdom than he&rsquo;d ever seen before. Barren fields now held
villages, houses, even a marble castle. They&rsquo;d plopped onto the
landscape when the cloud realm dissipated. There was the bluest sky
he&rsquo;d ever seen, with a star in the center, high up. A black
one.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Where
is everybody?!?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Captain
Toad dropped his defensive stance, blinking at him. &ldquo;As we
arrived they were exiled to the next kingdom over..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
tried to process that, his brain sputtering.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sir,
will you attack us or not?&rdquo; Hint Toad spoke up, jittering.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Heinemann!&rdquo;
The Captain scolded.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
know King Bowser is already infirm, but I did not prepare for a
fight!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
glanced down. There was dried blood from a puncture wound, where he&rsquo;d
held that statue. Like the real version of Clarentine, it managed to
stab him in the heart for one last measure.</font></p>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The hour
was up. Boiling over, the boo battered the metal mail receptacle into
pieces with their nigh-indestructible green Bowser racket. This
scared off their messenger, made the supporters flee the park, and
made Parakarry somewhere weep, but they didn&rsquo;t care. Had Luigi
forgotten after Mario &lsquo;crowned&rsquo; him the next big hero, or
stopped caring about Boo&rsquo;s aspirations to refold Toad Town into
something better- a place all enemies would face retribution,
regardless of the species they were on the outside? With a low growl
settling in their throat, they jabbed some digits, &lsquo;Mario&rsquo;s
new number&rsquo; as the bottom of the message stated. Waiting for
the line to pick up, the shattered bricks and debris of the park
scattered around Booigi II wiggled and rocked, as if their vitriol
radiated physically.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Kon'nichiwa
futatabi ky&#363;ban. Hahaha..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Booigi
rechecked the number.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ah
hem. Yes, Sarar&#299;man-sama, it&rsquo;s Kinopio-Kun again. Let&rsquo;s
cut to the chase. No less than five-hundred coins an hour with the
paid quarterly vacations and commission for each post with the
hashtag-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
message ignited in flames, the ashes scattering from Boo&rsquo;s
tight grip. &ldquo;Why are you making business deals with Mario&rsquo;s
phone? Are you with him? Don&rsquo;t lie. I. Can. Find. Out.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...Look,
Peach is sweet and kind. I enjoyed my stay at the castle despite the
spotty wifi and that disaster, but yeah, I&rsquo;m taking my
portfolio and-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ahhhg!
-Answer the question!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kinopio
snorted. &ldquo;I am blogging about your rampage, Boo. Check it out
sometime. 128 billion followers gave the post a like.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Booigi&rsquo;s
eye twitched. &ldquo;How many would your funeral get?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The boo
phased their arm through the screen to the other side, clenching the
neck of the toad who was at that moment, miles away relaxing in some
La-Z-Boy chair somewhere in Southern Mushroom Kingdom. Frost blasted
over his body, freezing solid the tears streaming down his blackening
out eyes, as if peering into The Underchomp itself. The young lime
green toad saw the flesh on his hands, squeezing the armrest crack
off, like ice, revealing his bone and sinew frosted over in crystals.
It began to roll up his arms reaching beyond his elbow.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Now,
</font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">fuzakeru
na!</font></em>&rdquo;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Booigi
severed the interdimensional hold with a chuckle. In Toad Town a tank
was rolling by the street over with a giant Kettle Thing tied to the
roof, not yet converted to a sticker. The boo began to follow, on the
hunt, until it crossed down Starman Lane, close to a particular
location. Booigi had slowly come around to the fact that they had
trigger points around the city, places where the &lsquo;wimp&rsquo;
Boo threatened to surface, which could not be permitted, not when the
other half of the duality held the strength needed to become
important and rid the world of evil. They wouldn&rsquo;t be like
their wicked cousin, who was punishment without order. They had a
purpose now. It was order. Then punishment.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Back
South, the toad gulped for air, swinging his completely normal, not
even chilled to the touch hands up to his face to examine. With a
crash a bunch of toads poured in and they found Kinopio trembling.
This rinky dink little home was a single room and housed everything
they owned, including the princess&rsquo;s treasures, mashed against
the corners so Kinopio could stretch out in this chair and recover.
Toadette assumed his cry was the hardheaded influencer trying to
stand or to walk against doctor&rsquo;s orders, but found nothing
wrong that he didn&rsquo;t leave MK East with, though there were claw
marks though his armrest fabric and his lap area was dripping wet.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bucken-Berry
slapped the fear status effect out of him. Before anyone could
question him, there was commotion outdoors from visitors in the
shanty town. Everyone was overwhelmed, nearly knocked off their feet,
by an aura of &lsquo;crotchetiness and moldy cheese&rsquo;. This was
marked the third bizarre happening since the departing of the Mario
brothers and Mr. Toad, the previous one being that time when a pink
jewel in a crate spontaneously glimmered, followed by a mild
earthquake.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
daddy-kins! I.. I only hope.. I can make you proud!&rdquo; sobbed the
koopaling princess under the dark green sky. Allowing his heart to
open up a smidgen, Roy snuggled her and Junior with a red scarf to
his runny nose, and Morton sniffling alike with his large arms.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wendy had
held on so stoically before, leading the pack to reconvene safely
when the majority couldn&rsquo;t think that straight, most
attributing her success to experience with dramatic frenemies, her
high grades in home economics, and perhaps the fact that she might
have been cut out to be a KT leader all along. Other members of the
troop, 500ish as meticulously counted by their lead sentry, observed
sorrowfully on the rocky elevations of Giant Land. An abandoned
orange Mushroom House up there held their captives as Wendy saw fit,
so many tended to their wounds closer to wilderness where some got
reported on by natives. It was prudent they officially establish new
leadership and now.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A teenager
holding his queasy stomach waved to a kid he recognized from Badlands
High as he reentered Camp Bowser. Jade was accompanied by Wendy&rsquo;s
old friends and all repelled from him, traumatized. Larry pulled his
long hair white back, forgetting momentarily he was a freak as
evidenced by his reflection in a pond. Wendy was the same, apparent
in her eyelashes and brows, except she avoided the questioning and
ostracism by such being easily missed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">To be
defeated like this wasn&rsquo;t new. Even losing their castle. Even
losing hordes of minions. It was the other &lsquo;happenings&rsquo;.
Wendy gave him a soul calcifying death stare and he knew he couldn't
confess to anyone. Overhearing his siblings however, a sense of duty
to his father became the angler reeling him closer anyway.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-So
we&rsquo;ve chosen Wendy O.? I mean Luddy and Lemmy aren&rsquo;t here
and Junior is, umm, yeah still a kindergartener.&rdquo; Morton threw
out there, unnaturally pithily. Junior, under all that elected to
keep kneading the scarf again and again.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yes..&rdquo;
minions droned. Wendy clasped her hands, giggling.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
cautiously stepped up. &ldquo;Yo, what are we doing? I don&rsquo;t
think dad is dead and even if he was you ain&rsquo;t gonna convince
me that Junior would pick Wendy as his placeholder!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Roy shook
his head. Without his glasses, Larry could see his reddened eyes.
&ldquo;Dem Skyland punks swept everything into da bottomless pit. If
nobodies seen dad, gramps, or granny, we ain&rsquo;t never gonna and
Wendy, I hate ta say it, while we fell flat, she was on fire.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">On fire?
More like on.. Whatever allows you to control a planet splitting
obelisk!</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wendy
lurched closer. &ldquo;And I adore thy- I mean I looooove MY precious
Bowser Jr.! Of course he&rsquo;d pick me.&rdquo; She nudged him,
hissing &lsquo;PICK ME&rsquo; through her teeth.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Seriously
sis?&rdquo; Larry rolled his eyes. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve locked Junior
in the doghouse tons of times.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
okay Larry.. I.. pick her..&rdquo; Junior squeaked, lip quivering.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wendy

us like he did our beloved Daddy-kins! ..Plus his hair is fugly.. &rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry was
shoved off the rocks, landing in sticks and twigs and a spiny minion
for good measure. At least he was not dunked in that torrential river
that ran through the kingdom like the first time he ran his mouth. He
sat with his head low.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
calloused yellow claw of a middle aged lakitu on a blindingly bright
cloud tapped him. A torn up balaclava was balled in his other.
Sporting a white rarely seen mustache in a short military style, he
also had heavy bags under his shifty eyes,</font></p>

will transport you.&rdquo; Thwomp #3 with an appearance of quartz
swung him onto his square head.</font></p>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Local
ninja kids from the Dojo waited at Tayce T&rsquo;s shop, where the
bus left them and where they knew their targets would make rounds.
Here came the armed King&rsquo;s guards on the sidewalk. They stood
innocently until they were close and then revealed their lit
bob-ombs. The bomb baddies in cohorts with the kids leaped at the
guards, blasting the trio off their feet. Then however came a tank
for backup. It swiveled around and fired back. One of the kids shot
through the window and collided with a glass case of delectable
sweets, scattering it all over the cakes and pies. The famous Toad
Town cook dropped her bowl and slapped a bill in their face. They
were paying for that.</font></p>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi spun
a beige, worn by previous fingers knob to the frequency of the

limp.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mayday!

white. No one acknowledged.</font></p>

muffled sounding person in the control tower. ~A screech of metal.

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
did not expect to see you in the office&hellip; Step aside, Spy Guy.

Anti-Guy on surveillance parachuting in like that?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Anti?&rdquo;
Yoshi repeated, stringing something together.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
airplane dipped in a mini stall, clearing dark purple ridges so
narrowly, Yoshi could count the insects trapped on a scuttlebug&rsquo;s
web hanging from the trees. Surprising himself that he remembered, he
lowered the nose following the declining terrain to regather speed,
enough to pull out of that ridge cut and continue the journey. The
engines were stuck at thirty percent, not helping tame the trills of
the wounded bird. He knew he had to land, just not here in the place
of Mushroomite pilgrimage, the Star Hills in two halves, indigo trees
torn from their roots lining the canyon down to deep in the Earth.
Rapidly approaching was Toad Town, equally unsuitable terrain to
land.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi was
mentally hurled back to the whirlpool, funneling down to his doom
until his gaze settled on a note he'd scribbled on what technical
details to announce on the radio. The engine temperatures, flaps
setting, and </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">souls

Not two, three. In the Overthere Poochy would gun him down with a
disappointed look, maybe even go on a hunger strike for giving up so
soon. The ray of a new plan cut through the darkness. Beyond Toad
Town, into Southern Mushroom Kingdom where the sun set, there would
be flat land and sparse developments for his best shot. The gleam he
was known for sporting during a kart race returned, more fierce than
ever before.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
rainbow haired koopaling was mesmerized, his brother glowing brighter
than the stars in the backdrop while he flipped through his lexicon.
Lemmy took a green crayon and scrawled another minute hand on his
hand drawn watch. He&rsquo;d been at it for thirty minutes to little
surprise, the commander infamous for delving into literature and
musical composition sheets while surrounded by rowdy plumber-hating
mooks, undeterred by their fleets&rsquo; tendency to get shot down or
explode randomly. By comparison, this intergalactic tractor beam was-</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Um.
Luddy?!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig Von
Koopa had a bout of panic at his form twisting, warping, and
stretching, before acceptance. &quot;Farewell, my trusted adjutant. I
will.. never.. leave.. you.. all...&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ignatius
Delta rocketed onward with some earpod thingies, oblivious to
Ludwig&rsquo;s dissipation. Virtually alone, Lemmy shuddered at the
black holes, clusters of poisonous gas, meteor showers, and angry
suns. The speckled stars in the distance morphed into threatening
streaks and lines from their speed, like the universe shredding
itself. Lemmy pleaded that they slow down while Iggy bobbed his head.
At at loss, Lemmy updated his watch with another crayon line that
came out all squiggly. He felt a push, like they were going warp
speed. His hair flew backwards, eyelids peeled back, and his cheeks
puffed open. </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What.
The. Heck.</font></em> <font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No,
he needed a stronger word for once. He&rsquo;d brave the soap later.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Phew. His
taste buds were safe. A second later they slowed before some black
mist. As Iggy made computer beeps, circling the unidentified galaxy,
the tractor beam graced the outer edge, where the mist snaked onto
and dissolved it. Lemmy plunged onto a ghastly planetoid of pathos
with a caliginous atmosphere, tombstones abound, and giant bones
jutting from the ground.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After he
was done screaming his head off Lemmy realized he&rsquo;d landed on
something soft, fresh soil that didn&rsquo;t match the terrain
elsewhere. Across from that mound was another of damp sand with palm
branches, beach umbrellas, and travel brochures mixed in. Adjacent to
that one- He swallowed the lump in his throat and investigated,
suddenly respecting his father&rsquo;s decision to not haul the
koopalings along for that centennial Star Festival invasion that
involved outer space. As he hoped he was imagining, the mound had
their unique Darklandian soil in it. He picked out the old stove of
Bowser Castle, the extra large refrigerator half buried, and at the
surface, a sealed copy of Princess Parlor on PS4.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There was
one more pile of something. He pressed onwards beyond a thick column
of bones. They were corpses thirty or forty bodies high, many
mutilated with puncture wounds deep, entrails hanging out and ripped
away appendages. As he nauseatingly studied he recognized: a line
cook, a shy guy: messenger #2, a koopa troopa: 15th infantry, and so
on, along with strangers, vacationers from their tropical outerwear,
now deceased and collectively draining blood and other fluids rolling
down hill in a darkened goo. Lemmy avoided it by accident on his way
there.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">AHHHHHHH!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
just dead people, Sumeet. How did you make it through police ac-
Oh...Similar voices. Sup.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The person
hammered down a wooden sign. The letters, previously drifting around,
arranged themselves into: &lsquo;Doom Star Galaxy- Work in Progress&rsquo;.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy fell
backwards. &ldquo;..H-how?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
Diddley shrugged. &ldquo;I dunno how they're gonna pull it off
either. Do space contractors even exist? Z.A.S. better not expect ME
to do, not cause I&rsquo;ve learned how to do-.&rdquo; While holding
his temple waved his other half-severed arm upwards. Lemmy became
suspended in the air.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo,
I don&rsquo;t know how this is happening but I&rsquo;m sorry!!!
Luddy&rsquo;s sorry too! He didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt you or cause
any of this weird stuff to happen!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hmmmm,&rdquo;
Zoo went for an overly long time. &ldquo;I knew that, hehe.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He let him
drop onto and crack a solid tombstone inscribed to a &lsquo;Gill
Toad&rsquo;. Lemmy hallucinated goonies flying around as he tried to
stand again. &ldquo;I meant, how could you do this?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
didn&rsquo;t!!!&rdquo; Zoo breathed out, calming down. &ldquo;Bro,
they dropped here like that. Can I make people&rsquo;s brains leak
out of their nose? Yeah. And does it sometimes coat the sidewalk and
streets in like what's happening here? Yeah, but here's deal bucko,
I&rsquo;m not THAT sloppy. I do leave bodies intact. I mean, duh! I'm
so efficient I gathered the mess once and tricked my brother into
painting with it!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
covered his mouth, gagging.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Never
fear, citizen!&rdquo; &lsquo;Sumeet&rsquo; Snufit, or professionally
Snifit Patrol, ran over with the lights on his helmet flashing. He
dropped a huge green anti-nausea mega-vitamin bigger than Lemmy&rsquo;s
head in his arms. &ldquo;Take that with plenty of water, young man.
Murders, pretending to be a reporter, fleeing arrest in another
dimension? That Zoo Diddley is so menacing it almost makes me sick
too.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
blinked at him, brain catching up. &ldquo;Thanks I guess? My brother
was looking for you and I think-&rdquo; He added to himself, &ldquo;I
know how to get him to notice senpai.&rdquo; He tapped around on his
phone. One minute later, a cyborg shot through the clouds, landing
with a tremendous thud. A stringy purple spiny piranha plant was
clinched between his teeth &lsquo;romantically&rsquo;.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy-sama,
where&rsquo;s the hot Gearmo chick that wants to check me out?!&rdquo;
The ocular sensors found no babes. He deflated, then perked back up
grooving. Fed up, Lemmy yanked those earpods out. This was when he
found that they belonged to Sam and Slam.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey!
Whoa!&rdquo; Iggy eyed the place as if for the first time. &ldquo;~99
errors reported in-. Excuse that. Where&rsquo;s Luddy-sama?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Your
tractor beam made him invisible as a side effect and hoarse, so he
won&rsquo;t say much right now&hellip; Isn&rsquo;t this officer your
target?&rdquo;.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Snifit
Patrol shook his hand. &ldquo;Hello. How did that confrontation with
your friends go?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy&rsquo;s
smile dropped quickly. &ldquo;Hi. Um. Can we converse about that
matter on the way home?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
projected from his open palm a new hologram in the shape of a
Biddybuggy, built &lsquo;extra strength&rsquo; so that the atmosphere
wouldn&rsquo;t affect its integrity and red, so logically faster.
While they were getting in, buckling up at the officer&rsquo;s
discretion, Lemmy located their straggler. Zoo had crept off to the
opposite end of the planetoid, juggling some femurs in the air with
telekinesis&hellip;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
have the gall to come over here still? You&rsquo;re alright, Ian.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
paused half way. &ldquo;I do jump through rings of fire on the
regular,&rdquo; replied dryly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Haha&hellip;
I'm not ready to go bro, and may never be. Just move on. And watch
Iggy listening to those earphones. Stars can talk to you through
that..&quot;</font></p>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Doll,
what I tell you bout writing scattered synopses?&rdquo; Steve dropped
the drafts back on the desk of Jessie the receptionist and more
accurately as of now, fill-in editor. &ldquo;And again you didn&rsquo;t
emphasize the MARIO!&rdquo; The bullet bill flew away.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yes
sir,&rdquo; she muttered, tapping the backspace. At this point she&rsquo;d
normally prop a vase to block his line of sight to her from his
office, but that had broken during the quake.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">While
continuously doing work she was inadequately trained for, counting
her blessings, things were calm, the Mushroom Press too boring for
the street fights between the King&rsquo;s guards and Boo poofing in
and out of scenes, freezing or thrashing on them with that
unbelievably powerful tennis racket. With other reporters on the
field getting pressure washed by the guard&rsquo;s endless supply of
water based thing stickers or caught in crossfire, she got to enjoy
being the only- She spoke too soon. In came a koopa that mystifyingly
left no salutations, on tuck in herself in her cubicle down the hall.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
redheaded human hid herself with a newspaper at what came next. Like
a micro-goomba infestation, there remained a few guards in every
pocket of the city, as seen now when one ran in, huffing and puffing.
He was mildly weasley, otherwise identical to others. A B-Dasher
screeched on brakes outside, making him sprint beyond the desk to the
back and corner himself at the big board of phone numbers. The driver
of that kart, a more stout guard barged in and menacingly closed in
on him, a mix of anger and agony etched all over her ruddy features.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Did
you really think you were gonna walk about with this-&rdquo; She held
out a dog tag. &ldquo;And expect me to not find out Benedict
drowned?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He fell to
his knees. &ldquo;Tried to save him, eh. I dragged his body onto the
shore, alone, and nobody helped or listened! A sergeant noticed he
was cold and marked his name off on some list.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She stood
there for a second, then dropped with him and cried. Jessie battled
between letting them have that moment and the unfortunate reality
that they might attract trouble somehow. With a small burst of
fortitude she slid away from her desk and stepped closer.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Excuse
me&hellip; Hi, I, um the Press isn&rsquo;t open for customers right
now and I gotta ask, umm-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The male
rose first. &ldquo;I understand, miss.&rdquo; He unabashedly snapped
a photo at their board with numbers of local eateries, shops, Mario&rsquo;s
old number and &lsquo;Peach Castle&rsquo;, both marked through with a
sticky note stating, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t call the castle please. It&rsquo;s
cursed we think- Steve.&rsquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
are you doing?&rdquo; the other guard asked.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
know we&rsquo;re supposed to serve the King and think Mario is bad,
and that the princess has too many non-toad freaks running around
undermining her rule, but I don&rsquo;t care. If Ben was nothing to
them and he slaved every day for the King, trying to do everything
right, the rest of us degenerates will be nothing too when that boo
grounds us to paste! Bridget, I quit.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip; <font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jon,
you weren&rsquo;t a dick for once, haha. Me too. I&rsquo;ll move in
with Trevor, maybe, and use my guitar to record custom Attack FX
badges till I&rsquo;m on my feet again. Sometimes I still like to
shoot stuff though, I wonder if that&rsquo;ll be an issue in this
district.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wide eyed,
Jessie backed away and into Kylie Koopa holding a cold mug of coffee.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;What
in tarnation?&quot; She slung the receptionist out of the way. &quot;I
heard it all. I don't know if I trust you folks, you seemed to hate
Mario awfully convincingly, but if you've turned a new leaf-&quot;
Kylie paused at a bunk noise. Jessie's wild orange hair spread over
her desk where she'd fainted. &quot;... Look you can hang here till
close. I'll ward Jess off when that power nap times out. After that,
sorry to send ya to the slaughter, but I'm occupied with another
toad's wellbein'. Or rather what he's doing to other folks.&quot;</font></p>

flushed, waiting as the two guards gave an uncertain glance at each
other.</font></p>

hovering ten feet over the ground lowered his binoculars. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve

ever use a weed whacker?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Because
they value the ecosystem in Giant Land, J.D. What species? Explain
please the colors, shapes..&rdquo;</font></p>

remarkable memorization talent to make up for your face blindness.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Don&rsquo;t
scream that to the heavens!!! I&rsquo;m 20/20 for sure and I DO see
people. Just gotta take note of em and hope they aren&rsquo;t being
stupid and wearing a different hat than usual or something.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yes,
prosopagnosia as I said. That you could not decipher who I was until
I shed all pretense in voice makes it conclusive. You did not think
it was literal?&rdquo;</font></p>

</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">If they

Hold on..&rdquo; He put his ear to the forest floor. Raising his
head, the teen&rsquo;s face broadened. &ldquo;I know this freakin&rsquo;

your trap. I thought this guy bailed on me!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A blue

forward. &ldquo;If that doctor&rsquo;s an ally to this traitor I

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Parakarry
depleted the last facial tissue from the box, despising such blatant
disregard for the mail system from those citizens who raided the Hot
Foot Locker for tennis rackets and set out to destroy the boxes so
that the guards couldn&rsquo;t write off to Poshley Heights for back
up. He didn&rsquo;t consider himself on the King&rsquo;s side, not
when he was privy to his inner workings, but there was room for
collaboration, even if they didn&rsquo;t realize it. MK East was
heavily fortified, holding most of the Mushroom Flu victims with no
cure in sight. (The method that Mr. Toad was cured not publicly
released.) This made their helipad, not being used for anything else,
his unofficial safe spot. It was decent up there, a breezy, and a
great view. He&rsquo;d seen a low plane fly over. Now he was seeing
more of the Booigi clan with rackets coming in. A shoot out broke out
in the parking lot. Parakarry voluntarily moved away from the edge.
As much as he wanted to confront Boo, to implore about what S.G. did
to them, he knew inwardly it wouldn&rsquo;t be civil. They were like
a different person from reports and the city couldn't lose its only
mailman.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">On ground
level, a toad grandma weaved around the young Mushroomites losing the
game of rock, racket, super scope blast, to slip in, whacking against
the automatic door. Correcting her crooked shaded glasses, she took
heed of the sign stating they were off and pushed inside the
hospital. It was as remembered remarkably the lobby, the paths down
the two wings, the receptionist desk, as disarrayed as she left it.
She folded her walker and sat astutely near two staff with badges
that indicated they were in a particular sector speaking low.</font></p>

be. It&rsquo;s a coma.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With a
start, the granny spoke up, steely and authoritatively. &ldquo;Lock
every patient's door. Immediately, before they violently coma walk.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The Crazee
Dayzee and Cobrat turned to her incredulously.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Give
it a go, sonny,&rdquo; she urged, remembering to sound geriatric.
&ldquo;You could say I was a nurse back in the day..&rdquo;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The rush
of acceleration, the breeze in their face, maybe the heart of one of
the pair doing funny things as indicated by that persistently beeping
monitor- they&rsquo;d accidentally stumbled into a picturesque view
of the deepest greenest and rural parts of Giant Land, channeling the
magic and wonder of the 3D maps Peach once kept in her library.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wish
I brought my camera!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wish
I brought..&rdquo; The caped-toad turned to the kitsune-plumber and
back. &ldquo;Nevermind. I have it.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dododo-dododo
do. Do. Do. Do..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Stop!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">How
about, &lsquo;Doo doo doo doo&rsquo;..</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
don&rsquo;t need background music, Toad!!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">*Deep toad
sigh* &ldquo;&hellip;Finally the page refreshed. Yeah, we weren&rsquo;t
imagining quote &lsquo;Bowser Freaks&rsquo; here in Giant Land,&rdquo;
Toad shut off Kinopio&rsquo;s phone. &ldquo;Sky Land is clean.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And
Mario thought Jr. Troopa was just showing off when he said he wanted
to secure a fortress on foot!&rdquo; Luigi teased. &ldquo;He probably
has all the intel at ground zero for Bowser.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His
brother in a tanooki suit folded his arms, half bemused, half salty.
He was embarrassed enough when he&rsquo;d lost track of his new
phone. &ldquo;I'll be a ukiki&rsquo;s uncle.. Wrong animal I know.
Shut up, but I see the smoke signal from Jackson.&rdquo; It couldn&rsquo;t
be missed, a square sector of cut trees for some structure. &ldquo;Ready?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
nodded eagerly. &ldquo;Definitely! Why cling to the numerical kingdom
by kingdom &lsquo;find out the princess is in another castle&rsquo;
shtick when the internet and those intrepid reporters can update us
on the dime. As for-&ldquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He nudged
Toad, who was scratching the back of his neck, off in his own world.
The tennis catastrophe canceled a haircut appointment, so in a rare
moment Luigi got to see his short often shaved off platinum hair,
given a blondish sheen by the sun. &ldquo;Earth to Mr. Toad K. Toad..
Shoot Jr. Troopa a text that we&rsquo;re on the way.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
hesitated with his finger over the application. &ldquo;S-sure.. So I
still need to drop by Sky Land. There's no snack machines I can reach
in Giant Land, and maybe also for diplomatic stuff I want out of the
way before Peach has to deal with it.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Relieved,
Luigi rubbed his shoulder where the yellow and blue super cape was
tied. It was foolish to find him being staid alarming. Mr. Toad had a
real job, and Sky Land's peace state was the better place for him
anyway. &quot;Godspeed.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The two
brothers delved into the forest before, upon closer inspection, the
signal came from some guy's home. World shaking, a trap door opened
up where a mechanical gloved hand emerged. It hovered over the
stunned twins, found them unplumber like to certain degree, and then
flicked them off the ground. Hurling across the kingdom, accepting
their fate, they questioned what Jr. Troopa's definition of
'securing' was.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The great
elevation of the caped-toad was no detriment to his jaw hitting the
ground. A stunning blue star filled sky draped Sky Land, invoking
historical sketches of the territory. The temperature dropped the
closer Toad drew observing the village. There were homes, towers,
even onyx outdoors monuments. Driving out Bowser and returning his
kingdom to its designated land at the same time in one afternoon
didn&rsquo;t match the King Ed Toad knew in passing, but he hadn&rsquo;t
daydreamed. The Skylandian&rsquo;s only battle scars were some cracks
in foundations here and there and that expansive long bottleless
trench. They weren&rsquo;t bothered by that, rather him. Maybe. They
kept pointing up and screaming. What, was something in his teeth?
Then he heard a ton of wing flaps, spinning as a swarm of Heavy
Para-beetles collided with him, flinging the toad out of the sky.
Golden leaves exploded everywhere from the super bell tree he bunked
on the way down.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">An
innkeeper was tipped off about a return of those &lsquo;beige
looters&rsquo;. They brushed off the leaves with a rake. Toad
uncrumpled himself, grateful he chose the hardier of the flight power
ups. If only he made use of the rear view mirrors attachment&hellip;
*Another deep toad sigh*</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
innkeeper, a light blue caramel skinned toad dutifully kneeled. &ldquo;Earl
of Mushroom Kingdom, my apologies for the delay in assisting you! Hey
Ciri, alert our King!!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
mistook that for a voice command until another toad, &lsquo;Ciri&rsquo;
leaped out of the inn and hustled away. With a closer view at their
villa, there were candle holders instead of electric lines and poles,
nothing motorized, and simplistic single story designs over all. The
onyx structures in abstract shapes were considerably older, he
suspected. Good thing he listened to his gut and relied on pen and
paper for his plan.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
coughed up a few leaves. &ldquo;Nice place, but you didn&rsquo;t have
to drag Ed out for me. Have him check this out somewhere
comfortable.&rdquo; He revealed a proper decree, on official stock
and lacking tall tales. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s some promises I&rsquo;ll
make sure my kingdom keeps for once..&rdquo; Like he&rsquo;d promised
himself when waking from the MF coma, that he would not stray from
Luigi&rsquo;s side. Now he had, for a worthy cause he prayed, but
impossible to determine currently.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The mildly
daunted villager accepted the message. &ldquo;-Thank you. Um, Earl,
we are also in generous spirits.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Really?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;If
not for the awesome and dynamic power, oh and sacrifice of our sacred
Pillar of Understanding, our king would not have been victorious.
Here is one of his inventions.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
pressed a short bronze telescope into Toad&rsquo;s hand. Something
unreadable was etched into the design.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-With
it we determined our enemies were limping around in Giant Land, the
ones not slain by their own sword,&rdquo; they added enigmatically.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Genuinely
intrigued, Toad rose it to his left eye and swiveled towards the
forest of the neighboring kingdom. There was a flicker of something
u..n..fa.t.h.o.m..a..b.l..e. Everything muted around Toad. Lowering
the telescope, he couldn't speak, recounting what that silence meant
too late. The world went sideways from his vantage with many pairs of
villager feet rushing over.</font></p>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The luma
was fixed to the main console display of the Comet Observatory,
flashing red as an indicator of abnormal energy in the galaxy.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong mama? Is it King Bowser??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Imagery
sprung of Bowser&rsquo;s lethal relentless doomships that stripped
them of their power stars and nearly left them drifting and powerless
in space.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Blushing,
the goddess leaned and hugged them tight. &ldquo;Nothing to worry
about..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Another
lie stinging her lips. &#9825;&#9834;!? stalled others by
conveniently requesting a tour. She coveted how guileful he could be
on a whim, pausing, pointing out a galaxy, telling a story, and using
his vast experience as a heavenly justice enforcer to keep them at
bay. Unfortunately everyone was rounding back around in time for the
energy at the core to flicker out. Rosalina felt the pinch of a
headache coming on, her experimental Gravitational Pull soul transfer
technology wavering-</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
understand your affinity for the Earthlings Miss Rosalina, but surely
you can do better than this..&rdquo; Stuffily, Polari accelerated
towards the Observatory launch pad where a new visitor, healthy,
lacking sluggishness, corneal clouding, or livor mortis
discoloration, regained his bearings and stalwartly faced the
accusing star.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Not
sparing an explanation he decked the black dwarf. Stepping over his
grumbling body, he fired at his divine helpers a stern, &ldquo;May we
talk?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&#9825;&#9834;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">!?
Swung his arm around the Koopa Troop commander. &ldquo;-About that
pizza we ordered. Move along kiddos, we need to show this guy where
the change is at!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig was
shuffled across a red carpet path, into a heavily decorated purple
building with gold trim around the entrance. Geno had a key,
suggestively, to enter that bedroom. A second later, Rosalina
followed them, relocking it. Ludwig tripped over the step and fell
forwards onto the soft made up canopy bed. Furiously he rose up and
glared at the other two, wagging the open lexicon.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
have familiarized myself more with those mythical &lsquo;Special
Objects&rsquo; scanning the glossary of this than your entire prep
talk. I especially appreciated the lack of forewarning that I was
susceptible at random to dark star influence. If reminiscences of my
brother didn&rsquo;t taper its hold on me, I shudder to imagine what
might have occurred at that critical moment.&rdquo; He shut the book,
the thick pages making a bop noise. &ldquo;To be concise, you two
would fit in with the more lousy of my college professors..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Rosalina,
holding an indistinguishable expression, turned to the star warrior.
&ldquo;My, he found his Special One.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
flushed bright red. &ldquo;Miss-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-It&rsquo;s
genuine love in general,&rdquo; &lsquo;Geno&rsquo; explained
preemptively. &ldquo;Romantic, family, platonic, whatev. You and Ian
are tight right?.. Or Lemmy, as I just recalled he prefers. My bad.
Just has to be love in its realest form, as real you are shacked up
here with us. -And you are really here so shut up and sit down
child!&rdquo; With a flick of his fingers, he flung Ludwig across the
room and into the wall next to the electric fireplace. Indeed he
physically felt it!</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Here&rsquo;s
a better version than that 109th edition watered down trash anyway.&rdquo;
Geno snapped. A spark landed on the retail book, upgrading it to
ancient papyrus scrolls. &ldquo;Agents of the dark star don&rsquo;t
usually come out of the woodwork to trigger the artifacts and
sacrifice portions of your planet in one Earth day, so forgive my
brevity before. Not having Millennium Star, the one that knows Great
Eld the most, put a toll on us.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The color
drained from the koopaling&rsquo;s face, the scrolls unraveling and
bouncing around. &ldquo;I..see. Could you.. Start from the top?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Geno
became resigned at this type of tale. &ldquo;So in the beginning,
lots of stars roamed your Earth as gods among the mortals kinda, and
the morality of some weren&rsquo;t so great. After Eldstar was like
&lsquo;enough&rsquo;, there were artifacts left behind that, prior to
the star's death, they&rsquo;d infused a part of them in it. There
wasn&rsquo;t much of a deal &lsquo;cause only somebody with psionic
power or a really strong connection with stars could make them react
in any way. Isolated situations in history where all the ingredients
came together were a drop in the bucket of the &lsquo;strange&rsquo;
that&rsquo;s commonplace in your universe. That&rsquo;s why we
weren&rsquo;t that versed on it. That&rsquo;s why things like the
Lexicon were the only surviving articles still speaking about it,
which few believe in your times, etc. Cue your janitor though, who
revived a very specific star. According to Rosie&rsquo;s console,
it&rsquo;s rallying all the other objects and amassing-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-With
all due respect, Rosalina, open up!! Quickly!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Higher
Authority, give me strength..&rdquo; Geno grumbled. Rosalina&rsquo;s
gentle touch on his rising shoulders kept him from Geno Blasting
Polari through the door and likely setting her bedroom and part of
the Observatory on fire.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Rosalina
cracked it open. Her heart sank, the secrecy of this mission
impossible to contain with Toadsworth&rsquo;s arrival. He was curled
up on the ground beside Polari.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Eldstar
forgive me...&rdquo; After he didn&rsquo;t respond further, they
brought the elderly toad to the observatory's fountain dome, dipping
him into the cool water.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Do
not attempt to cross the alluvion.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh,
no worries. I wouldn't with out the Marios around, er, folks-&quot;
Toad kept himself from the typical 'homeboy/girl' with this very
contemporary and genderless group of Skylandians. Not being able to
shoot the crap with these helpful dagger carrying warriors was the
least of his problems. He needed for them to leave him alone and not
notice his worsening arrhythmia.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
wish I could meet them!&quot; Many comrades agreed, strolling off,
leaving him at the bank.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Great, he
waved them off until the brush hid their light blue caps. At that
point he tossed away the ice pack and plunged into the river,
careening him though Giant Land uncontrollably. While getting drowned
nearly, he smacked against rocks and was poked by Spear Guys. His
best plan this was not, but he couldn't waste time following koopa
tracks, nor hit up Jr. Troopa, not with their last awkward conversion
looming over him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jr. Troopa
replied to &lsquo;Call this from now on -Toad&rsquo; with:</font></p>
<p><em>&lsquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey..
u didn&rsquo;t answer something..&rsquo;</font></em> 
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Like a
dunce Toad replied </font><em>&lsquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What?&rsquo;</font></em>
<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A few times.</font></p>
<p><em>&lsquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">U
like beards or not?&rsquo;</font></em> 
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
didn&rsquo;t reply then.</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Taking
that as a yes. What d u like ab them? Length, color, goatee,
mustache?&rsquo; Troopa continued to press. &lsquo;*laughing emoji*
jk jk&rsquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It hit
Toad like those Iggy&rsquo;s Castle pillars, that Troopa was teasing
him. He had to continue the hard way, paddling like mad, to tell
Luigi and Mario about what he saw with the &lsquo;Vrlrdyi Scope&rsquo;,
which was&hellip;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Recalling
the sight, his vision whited out- it was happening again! He lost
sensation as the river swept his body further along. Coming to,
floating belly up in an unknown area, a Boss Bass was on his tail.
Toad rose his arms in surrender. The fish tied on a tidy clean apron.
Toad then went &lsquo;psyche&rsquo; and dipped beneath the behemoth,
letting it pass over. He rose to the surface, watching it barge
through a log spanning the river and over the waterfall.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Waterfall?
He screamed.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hint Toad
crouched at the bank with the tranquility and shrewdness of a
documentary host. &quot;-Here in this quadrant of Giant Land, the
aquatic species include the emerald cheep-cheep, boss bass, Unagi,
and Mr. Toad as we see, kindly demonstrating in real time why it is
unwise to swim across.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Heinemann,
thank you. That was an opportune comment for once! J&ouml;rg, you are
unoccupied (as usual..) fetch the good man. Captain's orders!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A rope
landed over Toad's shoulders, his lips not quite parting enough to
utter his surprise as Yellow Toad tugged him out of the rapids.
Multicolored toads crowded him as he coughed up more water. They had
full heavy backpacks and a treasure filled utility wagon immobilized
by rocks at the wheels.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Mr.
Toad, why would you burden yourself to pursue Bowser?&quot; Banktoad
gave the wet bloated toad another once over. &quot;That is what you
were doing, right?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yeah.
Thanks.&quot; Toad rose up, picking the fancy, appeasing to the eye,
Vrlrdyi scope with him. Something mysterious settled over the brigade
members. They stared at it, hesitant to say anything until The
Captain returned shortly, tossing a giant tree to create bridge 2.0.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad hid
his 'treasure' behind his back consequently, noticing how Stan was
far stronger than he ever was in his heyday and, unsettlingly,
starting to look more like him as he was inadvertently weathered by
adventures and age. Well, besides the fresh looking scar that ran
down his manly brow ridge, creating a faint 'plus' symbol almost.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Mr.
Toad, take a gander at this.&quot; The Captain patted the trunk,
making it rock. &quot;Would you prefer to walk or ride?.. Ride it
is!&quot; he answered for Toad, proceeding to address Mailtoad. &quot;We
can make space by shedding those soulless commercial boxes.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mailtoad
flinched. &quot;I ..uh.. Thought those Koopa Troop documents were
fascinating and worth preservation but.. Yes Captain..&quot; He
unloaded a beige file cabinet, giving Toad a better view of their
overabundance of Bowser and Skylandian materials.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad knew
it. It wasn't about being a Mario brother aide, at least not over
treasure hunting, or since many could be dead, grave robbing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Everyone
is digital these days anyway, Mordecai. Your bottled notes may remain
however. That fits our aesthetic. Onward we go!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
simmered as the others were crossing the log bridge, aware of The
Captain hovering over his shoulder. &quot;Stan, I know the long and
the short of it. Luigi's gonna hear about this.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hm?&quot;
he replied mischievously. &quot;Why not Mario?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;He's..
You know he's in charge of everyone on this mission, powerups, and
spoils-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Including-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad went
'wtf' at The Captain's hand gracing his back, sliding where the
Vrlrdyi Scope was tucked in his rear pocket. &quot;Back off you f-.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;What?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Nothing.&quot;
Flushed, he put a little distance between them. &quot;Look. I was
given that willingly.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;T'was
cursed, I see.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;NO!...&quot;
Toad thought for an uncomfortable second. &quot;Or.. still no! I'm
cool with them and I just don't know how to use it right. By the way,
I'm.. antsy. Just being revived today and all. Just don't touch me.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Very
well. After this.&quot; The Captain pushed him hard, thee Earl
tripping into the treasure wagon.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad was
instantaneously carried off. It wasn't The Captain's prowess or
unwavering ambition that made him intimidating. It was, to Toad at
least, how casually he viewed his loyalty to the kingdom. Peach tried
to knight the brigade once and- thank goodness they would go on to
shrug that off. Only a couple of things made Stan click, prospecting,
gallant feats that might include the former, and exploiting
somebodies vulnerabilities. Toad knew he had more right then than
what was physically keeping him from abandoning ship.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
Captain joined his crew in turbo mode, tramping through brush and
high grass in a line. &quot;Brigade, let's remind Mr. Toad that, yes,
we can fight bad guys like we used to.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Didn't
we defer that work to Mario most of the time? And aren't we only
tracing Bowser because he has an expensive looking lapis bust we
want?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
Captain punched Yellow Toad. &quot;And isn't it time for you to
simultaneously walk and sleep again?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Zzzzz.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Better.&quot;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
evening sun tinted the haze of recently expired conflict orange.
Northern Toad Town, The Post Office, the local Inn, the item shop,
the library, and numerous other places were waterlogged empty shells.
Booigi would like them better as soot and ashes, but a Faucet Thing
sticker foiled that wish.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-You
cannot quit. You. Cannot,&rdquo; they snarled at the ten or so
hobbling off.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
shameful koopa dropped his racket. Banged up and chipped, it was
constructed of gray graphite and branded with a &lsquo;W&rsquo;
symbol, the logo for some obscure brand. More significant for those
brandishing this, it didn&rsquo;t have special &lsquo;launch victim
into orbit&rsquo; or &lsquo;shatter on contact&rsquo; powers like
Booigi&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Yeah. -Oww.&rdquo; He winced and held his
neck. &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t made of.. Whatever you are Boo-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Booigi
the Second.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Right.
Right.. Oww..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">At last it
appeared it had become too demoralizing for the supporters that only
Booigi could engage the King&rsquo;s guards and come out unscathed.
Every battle around town the boo lost a few, not counting anyone
arrested, fined and/or brought to the slammer, and here went the
final group</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Go
away then. Go!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The motley
bunch scurried into the nooks and crannies of town. Booigi was
already the change that was needed. All them. The others just.
Couldn&rsquo;t. See it. Puzzlingly King&rsquo;s guards were scarcer
to locate and they could not determine where they vanishing. They
didn&rsquo;t skip town was certain, nor were any more arriving per
local reports on the message boards, which came out exceptionally
fast and timely from the Mushroom Press. (Deciding for another layer
of mystery that they&rsquo;d have an internet presence now.) They
were simply going to have to patrol for them, zipping up familiar
childhood lanes. Familiar to &lsquo;Boo&rsquo; at least, not so much-</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hold
it, speedy..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They found
a middle aged dark green toad in the middle of the street, the only
living thing in a few blocks. Booigi ii huffed before the civilian.
&quot;I would stay indoors.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
laughed, his voice deepening. &quot;I know we all look alike, dude..
I was at the park. Mitch. Ring a bell?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Booigi
tilted their head. Mitch had hives on some of his exposed skin, and
despite his admirable effort to look sharp in a new suit, evidence
remained of a nosebleed issue by the wads of towels in his pocket.
His cold calculating eyes, one slightly askew, bore into the boo,
their vaingloriousness draining from the puncture.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
continued, &quot;I had to, you know deal with insurance and arrange
for a new car to be dropped off today. No big deal. Now I have an
offer you cannot refuse. Roll with me, baby.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Huh?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He sighed,
continuing down the kartless street. &quot;Hey kid. I'm trying to
make the best of this confined to a wheelchair thing. Don't.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No,
I didn't mean..&quot; Booigi followed reluctantly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Great
job whipping those Poshley toads into shroom shakes. Thing is, inside
scoop here, some local spoiled mushrooms aren't better. Peach is a
linchpin, hear? Just replace those guns and tanks with fire flowers
and stones and you're looking at some of your neighbors, still around
pretending to be model Mushroomites. It's an outrage!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;It
is!&quot; Booigi tensed, agitated all over.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Listen,
you could do something about it while Peach isn't around. Think
everybody knows you in Toad Town? Talk about the Mushroom World come
tomorrow!&quot; he chuckled. &quot;I love this diner. In here.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mitch
pressed the handicap door button to Club Gamecube, that other eatery
across the street of Club 64. Booigi blanked out apparently, they had
strayed back into normal portions of Toad Town, where some citizens
of all sorts were still walking about and only a few saw Booigi and
clapped admiringly or fled to alert the police. Booigi impulsively
ducked inside the eatery. There was a bartender stocking up and a
dozen patrons far back, otherwise no one at the waiting room but
Chuck the spike, seated like a doll or something. Odd, he said he was
not going to deal with Boo anymore, rather go home to his mother.
Besides that a purple Gamecube laying around in a high chair.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh
look who's here. See, that guy's fine with me. Actually, some toads
are too, like Dr. Toad. Red capped, blonde, as quintessential as a
toad comes... Not a problem tho. (Nor is he all toad anyway.) We'll
get something kid, and talk about the problematic ones-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Have
you been served?&quot; someone gruffly cut in.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Booigi
scanned around fruitlessly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
sentient Gamecube shuffled the menus at the podium. &quot;Over here.
I am the manager. I know it's strange,&quot; it groused.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mitch
slapped a one-hundred coin bill on his counter. &quot;Keep the
change.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Booigi and
the others passed beyond the velvet rope, in the main room where
there were dim lights and lounge music. They sat in between Mitch who
rolled up to the bar edge, and the spike, drooling, dazed, before
ordering tea.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Tasty
Tonic!&quot; Mitch barked, swiveling to Booigi. &quot;So, now that we
can get into specifics, let me exclusively chronicle your war on
toads connected to so and so...&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;There??&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yes.
I have access to the lists that used to work in the castle. You'll
get sixty percent profit back, that's right, I'm cutting you the
bigger slice. Deal?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Booigi
weightily tapped against the bar table. &quot;And I only need to
attack pedestrian toads..&quot; It had cryptically bitter aftertaste,
and they didn't know why. Logically it was sound, even if it included
some toads their other personality knew, like Russ T.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-You
wouldn't question that if I showed you this.&quot; Mitch's open palm
rested on Booigi's forehead. As a reflex they went intangible which
failed. &quot;Count backwards from ten,&quot; he whispered, his tone
dark..</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Why?&quot;
Booigi hunkered down, fighting against the dread overtaking them. The
entire room then had their faces blotted out, the lines remaining but
smeared beyond recognition. They continue to scrap a plate, sip a
beverage, or chat, oblivious to their struggle. Booigi submerged into
the floor, through the building's pipes, into the crust of the
planet, down, down, into the core, now burning, so agonizingly, no
matter how much they wailed in their mind that it wasn't real. It was
like dealing with- another boo.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Boo
E. Diddley&quot; Mitch said to the boo, still in the seat and
trembling in reality. &quot;C'mon. Count.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No!&quot;
Booigi spat with difficulty. &quot;Get.. your.. Paws.. off.. me!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He went,
'tisk'. &quot;I was gonna make picking your brain pleasant. Now I'll
just actually do it.&quot; His abominable abilities prevailed over
their incorporeal boo biology as he physically poked their squishy
frontal lobe.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-I
know better than to intrude after last time.. As I was saying wake up
or you will be excluded..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
drowsily tossed the pillow next to him at the girl in the open
doorway.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
huffed, adjusting her silver wig, clamped in a ponytail by two pins.
&ldquo;Dont ruin my makeup!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He turned
over, stripped of some covers and peeped with one eye. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
worry, homegirl. You still look like&hellip; what are you again?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Goomelda?
The wisest of female goombas?&rdquo; She leaned against the inner
door frame, indignant. &ldquo;Mr. Toad, I&rsquo;ve told you before
that for every Rebotco Fest, I will liken myself to someone
important, underappreciated, and in our mushroom genus so that I can
educate the other celebrants and simultaneously remain stylish and-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Alright
already!&rdquo; He rose out of bed, revealing his snow themed red and
green polka dot pajamas. He didn&rsquo;t even match the holiday it
was in that regard. &ldquo;Sure you didn&rsquo;t want an excuse to
wear a kimono?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Certain.
I better like, head down. I want to meet every guest coming in so
they don&rsquo;t miss out on a learning opportunity.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The pink
toad dressed as a scholarly goomba icon scampered off. Toad slid out
of bed, gigglish. Toadette was adorable when worked up over nothing.
A doorbell resonated though Peach Castle. Maybe it was something.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Overextending
his afternoon nap, that meant it was almost eight. He debated between
that much hated, meant to be renovated but hadn&rsquo;t yet, medieval
communal shower, where at basement level the water was more steamy or
his personal bath in the third floor bedroom, where it took
considerably longer for the water to become a quarter as hot. He
opted for efficiency over comfort and freshen up with lukewarm water,
still drying off as he hurried back to his half messy triple king
sized bed. Always only the left side where he habitually slept. The
opposite had never been occupied&hellip;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He laid
out flat a jumper he&rsquo;d purchased and accessorized to resemble
Prince Froggy. Aside from collaborating with Kamek, Toad admired how
chill, kind to his subjects, and carefree he was.. Also green.
Looking down from his high window, costumed friends were making their
way across the lawn of Peach Castle. A Mach Bike among them got him
excited. He moved away to preserve the surprise a little longer. He
had no qualms spilling the beans honestly, but while he and Luigi
were hanging out earlier today, just out in the lawn talking (they
didn&rsquo;t really do exciting things or stray from the house much,
and that was just fine) as Mario was on his back cursing in Italian
while fixing on the motorbike for the umpteenth time, the green
plumber danced around the topic of what he was arriving as.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
zipped up and practiced his frog hop on the way down. While the third
floor had no d&eacute;cor, the castle steadily shifted into a pumpkin
zone with orange confetti, glow sticks, autumn leaves, and
frightening cut-outs by the second. Big Boo&rsquo;s music box
blasting through the stone walls by the ground level. In the front
hall guests conversed around the tables holding refreshments or on
the mezzanine, leaning over and watching others. The princess
insisted they compartmentalize this year's party in here, the
kitchen, the aquarium, and the second floor den. Plus at midnight
they&rsquo;d better scram. It wasn&rsquo;t a favorite holiday for her
nor Toadsworth and it went south when they got more elaborate, like
hosting hide and seek tournaments. Yoshi still made off comments
sometimes about how he had to spend the night on the roof&hellip;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad slid
down the rails just in time for that distinctive rising of voices
when the Mario bros entered a building. Mario&rsquo;s costume... it
didn&rsquo;t even register really. It was Luigi he couldn&rsquo;t
stop staring at, a white helmet under his arm, waving shyly, eyes
darting around for somewhere to escape this loud busy scene, wearing
a perfect replica of a white armored Starfighter from </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Star
Slammers</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">,
a more geeky, hard sci-fi alternative to Toad Force V. Toad thumbed
towards upstairs to the left, the den, where Luigi and anyone else
less social could retreat and or watch Thrills at Night: The Movie
and not open themselves for potential ridicule from anyone over
&lsquo;secluding themselves from the party&rsquo;. Luigi caught his
signal, winked, and moved on.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Before
Toad followed, partygoers parted, letting him discern the crowd more.
As with many events people coupled up a lot. Mario, a pumpkin head
bat thing, and fans were around a crone, Peach. Toadette had
apparently educated enough so she was with Bucken-Berry, a Chargin
Chuck (likely a veiled way to get to tackle folks and get away with
it), and Ala-Gold was their third wheel, dressed, if it could be
considered such, as a green pipe so that people could toss their
candy in it and not realize it has feet, plus so on. Toad
involuntarily sighed as another person cleared security and got in,
the famous outdoorsmen Captain Toad, as.. &lsquo;Mr. Toad&rsquo;.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
splitting image, same shave, matching dye job, perfectly modulated
voice, so complete Toad, frozen the mezzanine noticed a pattern in
'himself' and interactions with certain ones, usually taller.. with
facial hair.. He concede that it would be more weird if he didn't
interact with the doppelganger raising everyone's cholesterol levels
at least once.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
caught up to him, next in line to play some dart game. &quot;Hey,
Stan. Looking handsome today.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Can't
say the same!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Jerkface!&quot;
Toad cracked his knuckles.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Says
the warty frog.&quot; 'Mr. Toad' struck the red center for max points
the first time. He was awarded a plastic wrapped Honey Shroom from
Zeror, dressed as Merlon (ironically as laical he was).</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Haha..
Oh yeah. Well, that's Prince Warty Frog to you!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He'd
commit to the bit for sure. Creepy but.. he had to have an eye for
detail to get it right, which Toad always admired in someone. It was
all too easy to look at a toad, in particular the red ones and paint
them with broad strokes. He knew him being not so docile made him and
individual among his ilk, so was The Captain imitating him recursive?
..He was way into his own head then. Either way, long as his loony
fan didn't do anything crazy he could stan, like his name.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Alright
I'm heading upstairs. You're annoying. Rude. Hammy. Not acting your
age. Yep, looks like you got my characterization as straight as
possible.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Phrasing,
homeboy.&quot; The copy smirked, spinning around. &quot;There's
nothing 'straight' about you.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With a
twitch, Toad socked The Captain. In slow-mo he smacked the
checkerboard tiles, the prize flying out of his hand and at Zeror,
who reeled backwards into a shy guy, who was actually a snifit who
collided with a yoshi who was actually a birdo who knocked over a
birdo who was actually a yoshi who flipped the entire drinks table
over Peach and Toadsworth coincidentally walking by. Gallons of punch
covered the entire room and soaked many in deep red syrup that never
washed out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad was
banned from that event from then on.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Someone
I recognize, finally,&quot; someone said, heavily German accented.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">'J&ouml;rg',
or Yellow Toad's boots were on the soapy floor, castle toads pushing
clear furniture for the next phase of cleanup behind him. He wore his
adventurer's outfit, no costume and no orange pass marking him a
permitted guest.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad was
on the steps, back in his pajamas, feeling both too sick to sleep or
do anything at once. The clock said it was near midnight and
weightlessness took over as the yellow toad sat next to him. &quot;W-what
are you doing here?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yellow
held this funny, slightly embarrassed, slightly something else look.
&quot;Just something I can do. Stanley is insensitive, we know. We
tolerate and try to making him a benign asset because he's William's
uncle principally. My sincerest apologies he ruined this event.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
skeptically scooted away. &quot;What is even happening??&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;In
your depression you overgorged on leftover candy, didn't you?&quot;
the lazy, or ostensibly so adventurer prodded.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;..Whatever.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Let
me lighten the mood. If your dreamscape reached the rooftop, I would
gladly go up there and perform all of Britney Spearguy's dance moves.
It's not like my crush would know. When I'm in his dreams I don't
flail like an idiot, or tell him I like him obviously, not with his
religion-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
tossed another wrapper into a trash bag tied to the newel post. &quot;If
this really is in my head, hush already man.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Of
course. He's way out of my league anyway, like yours's-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Mine
isn't out of my league!&quot; Toad shot back. &quot;I mean, I don't
have a... It's not a toad,&quot; he muttered low. &quot;That's the
bigger deal. I can't even pull the- 'we're technically all fungi'
thing.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yellow
nodded understandingly. &quot;Mr. Toad-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad shot
to his feet. &quot;Huh, well I feel better already vaguely describing
my problem without having a real solution yet... Security!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-This
isn't happening!&quot; Yellow Toad cried, being slung into the cold
outside by Bucken-Berry.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Couldn't
take that risk.&quot; Toad downed one more lemon candy, lifting from
the green wrapper to find a pressure washer nozzle 'accidentally'
aimed his way. Suddenly he remembered how that crazy night ended.<br/>
&hellip;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad woke
up- dry- but cramped in an awkward angle in the gear wagon. Looking
around, they were on a cliff surrounded by chiseled rock faces, high
enough where something got in his eye the moment the breeze picked
up. After some somber earnest thought he discreetly texted Jr. Troopa
for some gosh dang help. He replied right back with where he needed
to go, no harsh feelings. Toad settled a little more and tacked on.
'Btw, beards r fine. Moustaches are bttr.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He tumbled
out and rolled against Yellow Toad, standing upright and sleeping.
The other brigade members scanned around with handheld detectors.
Toad grabbed the unused one of Yellow, silently thanked the pudgy
weirdo, and crept to the edge. He saw the koopas far down with
something ominous going on, also much smoke. The brigade could only
be deliberately avoiding that, proving what he already knew. He
unfolded the cape mercifully still around his neck and leapt off
while they weren't looking. He flew&hellip; for twenty feet, then it
was more of a free-fall.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
trekked to the fortress again on foot, over chomping munchers,
sneaking around native homes, crawling through dense bush, and
ducking from swoopers, until they burst upon a semi-cleared out piece
of civilization, the fortress with the smoke beacon. It was actually
some guy's house.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">If
only I had the foresight to take the phone from Toad before he left.
We could just tell Jackson to, you know, have that security system
deactivated.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad&rsquo;s
probably goofed off and installed Thrice Candy Crush Saga.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Give
him some credit,&rdquo; Luigi snapped, flushing. He was starting to
worry about his friend, worry about if they&rsquo;d make it the
fortress this time, and worry about how his brother was so
discombobulated, likely thinking about how it might go down with
Bowser, he&rsquo;d walked the last mile without his hat and with his
shoes on the wrong foot.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Beyond the
sign stating: &ldquo;Hear ye, Voice of the Forest&rdquo;, a two
storied log home had satellite dishes, solar panels, and swerving
surveillance cameras on the roof, highly illuminated as night crept
on by the electric powered stadium lights. On the ground were laser
trip wires and old fashioned barb-wires surrounding the property.
While the recently cut grass held nothing, a sour greasy smell of old
tools, stale oil and gas was strong.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">In their
normal wear, they crossed the laser barrier, anxiously preparing for
anything. Mario had claimed beforehand that he&rsquo;d put up a game
of Roshambo to thwart that mechanical hand, and Luigi bet against
that, either way that would go unresolved as nothing happened.
Insects were their only fierce enemy left as they stepped on the
porch. The lamp was lit. The window had a blue glow. Luigi felt his
heart thump, hesitating to reach for the buzzer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He yelped
when Mario tapped him, sheepishly.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-I
left behind my duffle bag when we changed out of those powerups.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Face
palming, &ldquo;Mario, first your new phone, now-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It
is safely here,&rdquo; said a fellow Mushroomite by accent. The bag
landed in between them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
brothers spun into Larry Koopa, all blanched out, wearing Luigi&rsquo;s
spare overalls that dragged the floor, Sentry 11 in a red shirt, and
Thwomp #3 with a drawn on mustache and the M cap. The bare essentials
to exploit a rudimentary computer algorithm set to destroy anyone who
isn&rsquo;t a &lsquo;plumber.&rsquo; To see Larry rebel or do
something sneaky wasn&rsquo;t unusual, it coming together here and
now rather was baffling. Before Mario could comment on who they
blatantly were, Luigi covered his mouth. Someone was stomping closer
and a second later, a mega goomba with a hunter&rsquo;s cap, busy
goatee, and bloodshot eyes kicked the door off the hinge.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
told you Bowser Freaks to stay away!!! I don&rsquo;t care if y&rsquo;all
are wondering what to do while wandering around in the forest cause
you&rsquo;re lost and confused and lost three of your biggest leaders
confusing my chimney smoke for the your dagnabbit ceremonial- &rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Whoa
nelly! Don't X92 these folks.&rdquo; A little breathy from exercise
earlier, someone with a shirtless ripped physique and camo pants and
combat boots, a bandana, and a knife strapped to his thigh, squeezed
outside.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario did
a double take. &ldquo;Jackson, wow, this is a fortress?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
promptly shrunk into a dork. &ldquo;You mean the best one yet. It can
look like anything Mario, as long as you keep it sanctified&hellip;
Or is that saying about temples? Anyway, why did you speak Japanese
and then hang up when I tried to call you before?&rdquo; He nagged.
&ldquo;Nevermind. This is the fortress/ home of the Voice of the
Forest aka Dr. Richard Goomba Sr. PhD. This guy is an off the grid
post apocalypse icon I tell ya.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Like a
switch flipped the mega goomba became almost normal with a polite if
exhausted smile. &ldquo;First year nurses always get so enamored....
Ah hem. I see you are indeed heroes with such getup. I hope I did not
disturb you with my abhorrence of Bowser freaks. I loathe them. I
wish to not see them. Ever&hellip;And I'll destroy them on sight.
Anyway, welcome to my abode!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Plastering
on a smile in return, the plumber gang stepped in. Richard Sr. seated
himself at a comfy couch next to a newspaper covered window. The
cable television was next to it, the source of that glow, and across
from that he had doctorates on the wall, a human skeleton, a vinyl
player, a portrait of a younger grumpy goomba wearing a bowtie, and
an additional CRT that was set to a grid with dots on it. The
landline went off once while everyone filed in. He&rsquo;d answered,
hummed and hung it up.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Nurse
Troopa,&rdquo; he went, hiding impatience. &ldquo;Your presence for
the past few hours was exquisite, now I must now ask you and your
associates to state your purpose.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His direct
command caught them off guard. Then-</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Where&rsquo;s
my- where&rsquo;s.. That awful Bowser guy??&rdquo; Larry volunteered
first.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Richard
Sr. consulted that grid screen, able to read it in a way they didn&rsquo;t
understand. &ldquo;There are 497 KT in our mountains.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That&rsquo;s
where they are, right now?&rdquo; Luigi emphasized.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yes.
I cannot divulge specific identities however. Heed this. I &lsquo;speak&rsquo;
for this great proudly rural kingdom via my telecommunication. A
plethora of my neighbors, and we do stick up for one another,
recounted when they saw one. From this I was able to mark the spots
on my digital map. I&rsquo;ve already set up a portal there.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh,
another thing,&rdquo; Jr. Troopa spoke up. &ldquo;Dr. Goomba is also
responsible for the Portal Gun, which is how his son&rsquo;s crew, ya
know The MKDCU travel around the world in five minutes.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Isn&rsquo;t
that the wrong game?&rdquo; Luigi asked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Troopa
turned to Luigi. &ldquo;Not when a Pok&eacute;mon was seen driving
around here. Dr. Goomba used his special missiles for that one.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
meanwhile coughed up some nuts and bolts.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;m
going to have to see that to believe that.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The goomba
swung back a curtain to a pantry, empty, stuffy, and with an orange
oval embedding in the way. Mario believed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ogling
around the space, the view was too wavy to validate where it was
going visually. Luigi boldly surprised everyone by peeking through
first. Mario held his breath, it only lasted a few seconds when
leaned back in, radiant and determined.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Doctor,
since you live off the grid, do you keep a surplus? May we borrow
some?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Shortly
the Mario bros dove in with a pallet under a tarp. Despite it being
wider than the portal, it all fit somehow. Larry lingered behind as
they disappeared, contemplating, anguishing, and panicking alike
until he formed a puddle of sweat he hoped no one noticed. By the
grandfather clock&rsquo;s time the ceremony had commenced. If his
father was gone, could he allow his family to crown his sister when
the obelisk doing </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">her</font></em>
<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">bidding is
what killed him? Heck no. Bracing, he dove in.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That left
Thwomp #3, of which there was no such in Bowser&rsquo;s army since
five years ago when the real one passed away. Bowser Castle was a
logistical mess before a storm made it a literal one and the identity
withstood scrutiny until crossing old student J.D. He should have
terminated his espionage then, but how could he when it became
interesting for once. Now he was this close to contributing to the
rescue of his princess? He hopped right in.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Move
along partner. (I totally see through you..),&rdquo; Jr. Troopa
admonished the sentry he caught in perseveration.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sentry 11
blinked back, the fingers he was counting still held up. The lakitu
cleared his throat. He could hear Richard Sr. in the kitchen chopping
rapidly something meaty with knives. Indeed he did not need his
identity revealed right now.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He dragged
Troopa over. &ldquo;Kid, listen. I know where &lsquo;You-know-who&rsquo;
is now. I&rsquo;d tallied him before (Wendy) put &lsquo;two&rsquo;
people (the princess, Toadsworth) in the toad house. I just didn&rsquo;t
recognize his face cause he wasn&rsquo;t talking and was moping in a
way I&rsquo;d never seen before!&rdquo;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Flamed
torches walled off the Koopa family from the troop as the ceremony
began. A blue magikoopa, not Kamek, but one that shared freshman
class with him, approached with a large golden crown, a basic design,
not too heavy, only adorned with red rhinestones, on a pillow of
nesting material. Wendy O. sat, legs crossed on a throne of a cut
tree log, situated below the Toad House with the four others. Roy,
Morton, Junior, and presumably Iggy, held their breath as the
magikoopa presented the crown. Wendy slowly held it, watching her
reflection in the polished gold, tracing a gem with a claw. It was
pristine despite originating from many dynasties back, attractive
without being overabundant, but not really </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">special</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Stop!!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She gasped
at the defector, a green plumber in the sea of seated minions. Roy
barged ahead, through the torches, and got all in his face, towering
over him.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
do you care bout our business chump? Dere ain&rsquo;t no Bowser for
y&rsquo;all to fight!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
nudged him back. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do. Return our princess and
Toadsworth!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Roy
slapped him to the ground and sneered. &ldquo;Look at this green
loser, all &lsquo;lone thinkin&rsquo; he&rsquo;s bout ta stop us! Ha
ha ha!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Only
Morton joined in. Bowser Junior kept his mouth shut, knees folded,
Iggy statically did what he&rsquo;d always done, nothing, and Wendy
gawked. Roy followed her line of sight to the additional person
giggling, Luigi.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Didn&rsquo;t
any of you learn?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Behind him
Roy noticed that his minions, suspiciously quiet, sipping and gulping
down ice cold cans of soda, barely paying attention to proceedings
anymore. An unusually colored thwomp was near an empty pallet.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
the?!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Give
your lackeys a break. Fleeing a kingdom and staying outside all day
would make anyone thirsty!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Roy lifted
Luigi and half crushed him, shouting &ldquo;You are dead!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And..
you.. are.. distracted! Per.. your. surveyor.. minion,&rdquo; Luigi
explained, holding his grin despite the discomfort, &ldquo;You..
have.. a.. secret. captive.. you..might.. Not.. know.. about.. in.
that.. Toad House.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Roy and
his siblings whipped to the startling sight of Mario and Sentry 11
prying the boards that had been nailed on it. At the same time, some
rogue swiped the crown from Wendy, Larry. He scuttled with it under
his arm to the house and high jump kicked, the final blow that broke
it in.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Discard
thy sweetened elixirs and taketh these blithering fools!&rdquo; Wendy
howled, shooting to her feet. &ldquo;Cast them into the abyss!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Reluctantly
straying from their chilled Morel Moxies, koopas and dry bones
charged in formation to apprehend the plumber ensemble. From a jungle
vine, Jr. Troopa swooped in, bowling over many and knocking Morton
away. His body bounced down hill. Junior ducked from the tree stomp
Roy threw. Jr. Troopa&rsquo;s training all day kicking in, chopped it
out of the sky and then squared Roy in the jaw, freeing Luigi. It was
a knockout and in perfect view of the one stepping out the defunct
item home.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The red
crust filled eyes, scanned over the scene, his pesky plumber enemies,
the conspicuous crowning ceremony, awestruck minions, dumbfounded
children, and Larry holding the crown before him. His pallid second
youngest son looked from the crowd to his father, one tear streaming
down.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
knew you were still around, dad..&rdquo; He lifted it to Bowser, the
only sounds to them the sizzle of carbonated cans in the distance.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Speechless,
Bowser accepted and foreginly wore it for once on his lumpy head, the
unevenness of his unkempt hair crooking the placement. None the less
he was King again and that was that.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Or not!</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">WAIT
A MINUTE!&rdquo; He exploded, stomping the ground. All the torches
fell over and birds scattered from trees all around. &ldquo;What did
I just walk into??? A sham ceremony??? What the heck are you all
doing??! I avoided everybody because I wanted time to think and
somebody shuffled me in there for some reason then it got boarded up
and then.. I don&rsquo;t remember- but now you replace me and let
Luigi and Mario foil a plan for world domination I haven't even made
yet?!?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There was
an earsplitting eruption of pleas from his subjects.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">SHUT
UP!!!! This is what&rsquo;s up. Thanks to that time out I am a deep
meditative Koop King in touch with erm.. The thingies. Where&rsquo;s
gramps and old hag? .. Huh?!? Gone???? No way idiots. I feel an
overwhelming aura of crotchetiness and moldy cheese in my soul. Yeah
they are alive and will beat you all with a switch for drinking
caffeine drinks this late AND for replacing me so soon!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The Koopa
Troop shrieked in horror, running off and hiding into the trees or
underground to avoid the wrath of their elders. Wendy screamed in
place, eye flashing. Bowser ignoring that, only finding it strange
that her tantrum wasn&rsquo;t making it spontaneously rain like it
always did.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
confidently strolled past the shocked stupid faces of his kids. &ldquo;Is
Peach and Toadsworth in there?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And
moooooore!!!&rdquo; Invisible against the sky, a cape wearer landed
clumsily on the roof of the home with a detector flashing and
blaring.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad?!
You.. how did you get here? What is that?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
peeled his face off the mushroom tiles and slid off to the ground.
Luigi caught him, perplexed and immensely relieved the same to see
him again.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He turned
over. &quot;Thanks.. Haha&hellip;Was I late to the epic thing you
did? Darn. I fell for like, hours.. Captain Toad held me up. I took
this treasure detector thing to find you all and I was given back in
Sky Land a neat tele...&quot; He reached in his back pocket, eyes
widening at what wasn't there.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Telescope?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Nothing.
Just.. I can stand. Go do your thing,&quot; Toad urged him off.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser off
to the side rolled his eyes. &ldquo;Ignore these extra characters.
Yeah Peach and her old man is in there yadda yadda. Do your hero
thing already..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Back to
business, Luigi prodded him back to the Toad House with Mario in the
rear, making sure no one counter attacked. They entered the dark cold
clay building, emptied, with and upstairs. After flashing a signal,
Luigi darted for that while Mario remained with Bowser on the smaller
cramped lower floor. His nemesis aware of how this post-battle
interrogation went, he reversed until his spikes hit the stairwell
wall. He was in view of the window and in the moonlight, and a lot of
scarring popped out at Mario. There was also in there a blue statue
that detector must of been beeping at. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
did a bad thing.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well
duh.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Why?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">To
fight you!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
shrugged. &ldquo;So what&rsquo;s so different about this millionth
time I&rsquo;ve been defeated?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Because
Bowser this time...&rdquo; Mario steadied, channeling disappointment
and anger, along with solace that he was alive, the perceptivity that
he could not judge him without accounting for his role, into an
action.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lost in
the embrace that followed, something was new about it this time.
Bowser wasn&rsquo;t sure what it was except that it made him do this.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Alright,
I&rsquo;m sorry for this stuff I guess!&rdquo; he blurted out. &ldquo;I
mean, I took her, yeah then other crap started going wrong. Something
was in my system and I thought a good fight would bring it out. It
didn&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
separated only a little in their embrace. &ldquo;Bowser, this is
where I was getting at. It&rsquo;s different because.. Would you
retire with me?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
appeared to let that sink in. &ldquo;And &hellip;Just play tennis all
day??&rdquo; He released the plumber to fold his arms and stare off
grouch like. &ldquo;My EVERYTHING is awry in case ya can&rsquo;t see.
I&rsquo;ve lost my home and most of my troops. Two of my sons haven&rsquo;t
returned from outta town. One of my sons looks like a hologram. My
daughter just took being a brat too far! And my gramps is flat out
missing, along with my ugly hag in-law and my clown car keys!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-I
get that angle. Really. I had to start from scratch too once, you
know. After you get situated and we cure people of Mushroom Flu- You
still aren't getting out of that!&rdquo; Mario punched him lightly,
then eased up. &ldquo;I understand just by hanging with Peach that
there&rsquo;s a lot involved in delegating, but if you&rsquo;re
willing to consider it then I&rsquo;ll help you.&rdquo; He reached
for his claw and squeezed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
faced him tentatively. &ldquo;Stop. W-we can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Fine.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Cause
I gotta do this!&rdquo; He lunged at the red plumber, forcing him to
flip backwards across the doorway and against the opposite wall, in
the perfect spot for Bowser to snatch him and lift him upward, his
feet dangling.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser!
Come on!&rdquo; Mario fussed, punching and kicking the air.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
thought you loved it like this?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
stopped struggling.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">In spite
of that build up, the shallow breaths of both, the inferno inside,
all he could go for was a quick- strictly platonic!!! (he kept
relaying in his head) -Peck on those chubby cheeks.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">.&hellip;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">This toad
home was deceptively large, wider at the stop and with far too many
steps to tackle at night-</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi,
is that you?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
princess&rsquo;s voice was so&hellip;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Are
you two okay??&rdquo; he panted.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
am.. In one part, yes.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He felt
his heart thump in his chest as he bent down to her curled in the
corner with Toadsworth. She reached out and felt around until her
gloveless hand rested on Luigi&rsquo;s forearm.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach,
are you okay?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Some fresh
moonlight caught her visage, shining through a bang in her stringy
blonde hair. Luigi breathed out &lsquo;Oh God..&rsquo;</font></p>

somethin' new!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Alright
alright, calm down!&quot; the plumber laughed gently, not letting go
yet. &quot;Bowser... I don't think I've ever seen you in your crown
before. Not a crown. That one.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Really?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;So
last chance. Yes or no?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
stared back, flushed, cogs in his head visibly turning. (Just do it
stupid. For the past six years you've had a plan going. An ethical,
crowd pleasing- well 'cept for this part, way out.) &quot;I-&quot;</font></p>

&quot;Whatever's going on! I swear!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
carefully came down, stabilizing both Toadsworth and Peach. Mario
dashed over to help and, temporarily forgotten in the corner, Bowser
was relieved to get out of that. Pressure might have made diamonds.
He could see it in them, in how in a matter a few moments playing out
in front of him, they roped Fungus Face in there and he got a whole

amusement. He almost wishes there was an audience to witness how he'd
perfected his telepathy, skilled enough to cram decades of curated
information into a subject's mind in one session. At this point he

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
reporter snagged the fire ax of the establishment and rolled on to
his destination alone. He surveyed castle grounds from across the
glassy lake, the reflection it should have of Peach's Castle missing.
He followed the river towards Star Hill until he found a spot where
castle grounds intercepted the chasm. Evaporating the last bit of
doubt in him, he tugged off his shiny left dress shoe, chopping the
exposed pinky toe to the bone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With a
sacrifice for the fissure of the obelisk, he chucked it down before
he bled too much. Psychically imprinted on, the appendage that was
dead while attached told him everything about what was on the other
side of the abyss, as immediate as a lightning bolt. He smiled. What
else he needed then was buried, or submerged rather a mile down.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Covering
in moss and twigs, a towel wrapped around one foot, he gestured to
the lake upon returning to it. Bubbles emerged as fragments rose,
white painted bricks, pink tiles&hellip; He could sort for it right
then, but it'd be useless. Better to entice the 'owner' to do that
for him.</font></p>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dusk hours
made the blinking lights obvious to sheepish observers, realizing
with a slap to the grizzled face that there wasn't supposed to be a
second water tower near Mt. Rugged. One rancher was even zapped by
the entity's defense system after wandering too close. A party was
organized to sniff it out. Dr. Topper in the back of the candlelit
town square meeting rushed to the lab with renewed zeal. It matched
the description of the spaceship of none other than Prof. Morris
X-Naut. If they outpaced the Southerners and used it to beam the
professor in from his unknown location in Toad Town, problem solved,
except&hellip; Dr. Toad was </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">still</font></em>
<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">in his
atelier.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
flattened down his tie-dye jacket, resisting making a scene. The sand
in the hourglass on the table drained steadily, like their time
before Mr. X would expect results. &quot;Hi. Why don't you slip on
your shoes?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Startled,
Dr. Toad dropped some pastels. &quot;It's more comfortable without
them,&quot; the toad doctor replied, composed again.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The hammer
brother pursed his lips. &quot;Drew, we've found Prof. X-Naut's ship,
or the locals have. Better us get to him before they slingshot him
down...&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
brushed past to clack away on the Family BASIC PC. &quot;-Morris
would never drop his shields. No matter. I must tell Maverick and
Sigmund.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Topper
tried to bend around the tall toad and squint at the messages through
the narrow angles on the LCD. Besides it's purpose of accessing their
other facility via a terminal, it was said to host the best puzzle
games ever, locked behind Dr. Toad's passwords. &quot;Can't that
wait? If Dr. Gloom and Shrinkasaurus wanted to keep on our shells,
they shouldn't have stuck to online conferencing... Fine. I'll go.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
snatched the green hammer bro by the coat. &quot;John, you cannot!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Why?..&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He jabbed
the 'send' button. &quot;...Because doctor.. my diary is in there.
Yes, mine. No one else's. And.. there's stickers on the cover, see,
and... like I said, I'll do it. You can use the computer in the
meantime.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Topper
sighed against himself. &quot;Alright...&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The K64
was overshadowed by high speed rail services like the Toad Town 10X
line, or different styles altogether, but beloved still for its rich
history, dedicated staff, and rails that weaved around some of the
most inhospitable of terrain.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;It's
only brain fever. I will sleep it off.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadsworth
remained where he was. &quot;Where, my dear? That hotel is..&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No
no. It'll work out,&quot; she trailed, curled up in the rear of the
car.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad got
the hint by then to leave her be. Something one would never know with
the polished Lakitu Bros chronicling of their lives, the princess
always had a 'calling' of home, the most traumatic of these
adventures when Toad Town was utterly destroyed. He sure hoped not.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No,
crossing by Jr. Troopa, able to operate a phone despite being folded
into a paper swan by koopalings, it couldn't have went down like that
back home. He'd told them. Sure there was untamed wilderness outside,
but everyone under the age of twenty-five could find a signal if they
wanted to. Mario meanwhile, twiddled thumbs. With that tarp covered
object taking up the spot next to him, Toad couldn't dip over quickly
and ask what any of that was about. That left Luigi in the front,
alerted when Toad slid next to him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Everything
settling, that was what he planned all along. Still, he'd better be
discreet. He adjusted Kinopio-Kun's iPhone on the lowest backlight
setting and used the notes app..</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">'I'm
worried about Sam, he don't look good, and especially our girl.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He texted
back. 'That didn't escape me either. Toadsworth was cold! What's
next?'</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">'First
thing tomorrow we- (magnifying glass emoji) on those two. ...Also I
buy you a- (cake emoji). You saved the day! (streamer emoji)'</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
stifled a laugh. When Mario glanced over, the green plumber self
consciously ducked some, replying, 'Look, WE saved the day. It really
captured the zeitgeist of how it used to be. You know, us not knowing
what we were doing.' He chuckled openly then. 'Even 'I'm so retired'
Mario helped do whatever the heck he did so that Bowser never tried
anything. My only regret is not getting back to Boo today.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">'Srs?
Sorry man... Hey, do you have pics from that tennis game?'</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;What?&quot;
Luigi grabbed the phone. 'I mean, what? I'll tell you. You had a
whopping two-hundred volleys in one set! You didn't starch your vest,
you've lost ten pounds without telling me, one shoe was untied, and
your fly was not quite open, but dangerously getting there. I yelled
from the stands to no avail, lol.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">'Everyone
else?'</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">'I can't
remember off hand.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">'You
really are over Daisy, aren't you?'</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
blinked. 'That blunt? Sure. We're photogenic together and my fan club
really (he hunted for the bold button) <b>REALLY</b> wanted us to be
a thing, but our love languages weren't the same, and we had that
omnipresent issue, that more of us have than we want to admit, of
needing Mario to coalesces. If nothing extravagant was happening, we
weren't if you get me. Was I the problem? Probably.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad kept
fixed on their chatter forming one big paragraph on the display, the
legal pad skeuomorphism of the application bathing him in yellow.
Luigi steeled himself for some derision. He just undercut his own
success, his ability to sustain a relationship, everything short of
admitting that he liked some Brittney Spearguy tracks. (Some. Like
the 90s ones)</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
cleared a lot of it out, his reply interrupted by a huge bump.
Actually it felt like they hit a brick wall. Everyone in the train
was launched against roof, landing again on hard surfaces as amber
sparks flew outside. As soon as it happened, it was over, the
engineer peeking into the disarrayed cabin, apologizing over the
excessive speed at a switch.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dizzily,
Luigi grabbed onto a coat rack to crawled onto the seat again. &quot;Ugh.
What?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
was gonna say..&quot; Toad went blank, maybe from being banged up, or
maybe.. &quot;You're.. kind, articulate, empathic, clever, and
low-key braver than your brother because you've gotten you where you
are with a fraction of the support. It wasn't you, Luigi.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Huh?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad bit
his tongue. &quot;Or Daze. She's cool too, ha ha.&quot; He reached
over and flipped up the shutters. The stars were shining on him. &quot;Oh,
and look at that. We're almost back!&quot;<br/>
Everyone, including
Jr. Troopa, jumbled back into being crumpled but Koopa shaped erupted
in applause. There was a shimmering sea out there while they skipped
from rickety, just functional bridged islands. When Toad noticed some
paratoopas working under utility lights, erecting a billboard for
Wendy O. for mayor, he retracted that earlier thought, breaking into
a even colder sweat.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Bowser's
daughter..&quot; Toadsworth shook his head ruefully. &quot;Of course,
extend that stronghold will you?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Neo
Bowser City is still independent. I'm a candidate too.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He whipped
Toad's way, making him shrink. &quot;Preposterous!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Besides
reunification, I know about all of their problems, the demographics,
and the area codes by heart from you sending me there all the time,
Sam! What if instead of commerce, I actually help them?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
stood slowly. &quot;Toad's a famous face, has never been in a
scandal, and knows Darklandian, a good ice-breaker to those folks.
Let him cook.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;See
you get it. I was wondering if.. you'd be my deputy?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
rayed. &quot;Absolutely.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach shot
up. &quot;I... Could we discuss this later?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Then Mario
leaned over his seat. &quot;Peach, this doesn't sully you at all.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;That's
not what I-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Toad
I'll vote for you.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Me
too, partner!&quot; Troopa chipped in. &quot;I'll tell my workers
too.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Me
three!&quot; was the muffled shout of the conductor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
princess massaged her temples, her and Toadsworth giving up
seemingly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Cool,
so we survived that- somehow, homeboy. Thanks, we'll talk about it,&quot;
Toad shook Luigi's hand, which they mutually pulled into a hug. The
toad used volume control as they finally seated, whispering. &quot;And
I was thinking, like.. Over dinner sometime? I mean, if you want..&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi felt
the pressure increase slightly in the clasp of the hand shake they
were still holding, forgetting to breathe as they locked eyes. &quot;Ah...
You mean?-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;A- a
date, yeah. Or going somewhere if you want to think about it that
way,&quot; Toad continued, low and just a bit shakily.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Where
is this coming from?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Truthfully,
&quot;From way back and from just now at the same time.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
plumber leaned back into the wooden seats, blushing. &quot;Why not?
Just- nothing extravagant.&quot;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Can
we go, Kinopiko?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yes,
sorry.&quot; The pink toad closed a bookmarked page, the lime green
toad leaving her behind. At least the 'let's stop and rest' and by
'rest' she meant 'I want to study' worked three times consecutively.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kinopio-Kun
might have had to use a walker, cocooned in heavy blankets when they
all knew by then of his Yakuza tattoos, but she had breaking her neck
and shoulders Peach's parcel, why she struggled to catch up on the
country roads. If not for its resemblance of a purse, she'd not be
asked to carry it as the female identifying castle toad. Oh wait, she
specifically begged for the honor. Still though-</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hey
Kinopiko, I know you aren't on borrowed time like me, but you know
this area more than me. Do keep up.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Boos
have terrified people with hallucinations for centuries. I wish you'd
stop saying that.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I'm
running from kodokushi. That was a vision then. It'll be a reality if
I don't resign tonight.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Excuse
me. What is?-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Don't
worry about it.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ala-Gold
would have known, she thought. Always with access to the imports from
King Omarinon's domain. Also why Kinopio showed up with the 'bishie
sparkles' and all, he was totally immune.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">As they
were dressed relatively like cityfolk and toting items, bags, etc,
they appeared like nocturnal salesmen or evangelists when strolling
down someone's driveway by mistake, it indistinguishable from forks
in the road. Awkward times.. Eventually they were out of residential
area, where the stars twinkled in the deep blue sky and insects
chirped from high bean farms, the stalks waving frequently in the
wind.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
soured as they crossed a pillory belonging to the local jail at the
side of the road, wooden individual cells side by side. Imprisoned
Paper Macho Outlaws clamored at the bars.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Psst.
You over there. Help us out,&quot; croaked someone in the last cell.
&quot;We don't belong here!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
flashed a light upwards at two short snouts sticking out the bars.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Like
we're going to fall for this..&quot; Kinopio said down low. &quot;Who
are ya anyway?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Mr.
and Mrs. Hotstuff,&quot; answered a different screechy and softer
voice.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Both toads
rolled their eyes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No,
it's true! We were minding our business in our jacuzzi then- wham!
We're in this smelly old vehicle of some health inspector weirdos.
They locked us up because we're koopas! We're sweet 'n innocent!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hmph,
mostly..&quot; groused the other inmate.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Got
somethin' reflective? Couldja just, erm, write our names in it?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
gestured to silently walk away. Kinopio in pity slipped them a
business card for a good attorney. Toadette found that unexpectedly
thoughtful and was inspired to spare a little mirror anyway, whatever
it was wanted for. She'd not miss the cheap thing. They continued on
until a bright flash casted their shadow as far as Vick's barn a
quarter mile off. They spun to find two wrinkly magikoopas outside
the cell, one in dark blue trunks, the other a purple one piece, the
mirror at their feet and shattered from behind tossed out by them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Kamek!
Kammy!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Hotstuff,
toady brat!&quot; Kamek sneered. &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Hotstuff to you!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;We
used the internet to legally change it so we could fool some
schmuck!&quot; Kammy 'Hotstuff' revealed a senior oriented phone with
oversized buttons.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
had a..&quot; she trailed, gawking. &quot;Excuse me, but why not just
call someone for help?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
magikoopas shrugged at each other. &quot;Maybe our folks were in
mountains or something. Sayonara!&quot; They whisked off in the
country.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Ugh!
Just what we needed.&quot; Gritting her teeth, Toadette tugged
Kinopio along, chasing the baddies to a western styled theater.
Spotlights lit up the advert for the traveling Paper Macho Friends
Troupe. Jazzy music bled out the open swing doors and ostros of those
inside were tied to stakes. Someone blocked the toads.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Sold
out,&quot; informed the noki nurse they seen around, name tag bearing
the odd name 'Laki Bond'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kinopio
whipped out a platinum VIP pass. Laki adjusted his glasses, quickly
shifting out of the way for them. Indoors the lobby was devoid of
anyone, the snack booth was closed, and one person was in the timed
coin operated massage chairs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She tapped
Kamek, crusty feet up leisurely. &quot;I am so reporting you!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Why?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;...Uh&hellip;
You have no shirt or shoes! &hellip;And you used a wooden coin for
the machine. I literally see the string attached to it in your hand!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Go
on Karen, ee hee hee!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Determined
Toadette stepped away, spotting someone ostensibly of authority
entering the auditorium. She tracked the country toad girl down in
the isle.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Howdy!&quot;
Rou T. as the nametag stated squeezed the mess out of Toadette,
pulling her with her. &quot;Sorry Luci T., didn't think you'd wander
down. I see a spot!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Some Birdo
lookalike lip synced before dancing cowboys as Toadette found herself
stuffed in a front row seat with the nurse. She glanced to her left.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
adore this show!&quot; Kammy squeed. &quot;....What is it called
gain?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Then the
lead singer pointed Toadette out. &quot;You there, darling! Come on
up!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
intonation, drawl, all inaccurate to the real pink dinosaur. Toadette
would know, Birdo being one of the few non fungi she cared to study.
With infatuation and a teaching opportunity both reeling her in, she
was up and on that stage in a jiffy!</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Losing
sight of Toadette, Kinopio backed outside again, panged with
enervation. His island dwelling instincts resurged, taking note of
the bright spotlights. He carefully dropped without bending his back
and swiveled one towards the clouds, jiggling the plug to power
switch it in a pattern. He then offered the noki approaching a wad of
cash.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
will not accept a bribe to ignore you,&quot; Laki replied sternly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The toad
let the bills drop, like they were worthless. &quot;That's to not
ignore me. Get me home.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Sir?
I-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
know you can. You have spies in your family. Two of them. Actually
three, unless they finally got that divorce.&quot;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
did the King say? Over.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Koopalings
spotted outside palace. Earthquake ruined the construction zone for
daughter&rsquo;s castle. Hoooold it, I&rsquo;m doing the
interrogation here!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She gave a
snort, with the hand off the receiver button.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The senior
guard continued, &ldquo;-You&rsquo;ve been absent for hours! We&rsquo;ve
set camp at so and so coordinates. It&rsquo;s southward and not on
any maps for some reason, eh. Very flat and fugitive Boo Elenor
Diddley hasn&rsquo;t been seen. I suggest you and Jonathan get here
for discipline. Over.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sure.
Over.&rdquo; She clicked. &ldquo;&hellip;My dead body.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The toad
guard dinked around in protest, plucking away at the guitar, hooked
through an effects pedal and into the speaker of her radio via an
adapter she found at a Radioshack, creating an awful screech that fit
right in with her audience of cicadas in the bushes and shrubs of
Toad Town park. A few coins were in her pocket from manning landlines
for Kylie Koopa, phone bombing MK East, leading to the &lsquo;scoop&rsquo;
that former nurse Nass T. might be in town. Now that chapter was
over, and Bridget wasn&rsquo;t too invested in the ramifications of
that.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The guard
half tiredly fixated on the metallic green Boss Waza-Craft BS-3
&lsquo;Blame-Shifter&rsquo; modulation pedal in the grass. It was
from the pink boo Trevor, her boyfriend maybe.. He&rsquo;d truthfully
told her to not activate it until Festive Tree day after she found
the present early during the first and only time she&rsquo;d been
inside his home. No telling what he&rsquo;d think considering she
snuck it out with her and held on to it until now, when at last she
had the guitar to accompany it. She stomped on it. The &lsquo;Check&rsquo;
light came on. The knob was on the &lsquo;bassist&rsquo; mode.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Far far
away, Lemmy Koopa was smacked with depression. &ldquo;I feel like
everything is my fault, the thing with Iggy, you, and Wendy. I
remember it as well as yesterday evening.. Because most of it was.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig, in
the backseat of the intergalactic holographic Biddybuggy, swept him
closer. &ldquo;Fret not. Look at this mission of what we need to
gather..&ldquo; He unfolded an ancient scroll, from Geno.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Eggs,
a figurine, and an engagement ring?-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The blue
haired koopaling flipped the shopping list around and bashfully
tucked that way. Before he retrieved the real thing, Snifit Patrol in
the front passenger spot pointed to something twinkling on the
approaching home planet.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
distress signal!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Officer,
we are occupied enough with a treasure hunt!&rdquo; Ludwig said.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No,
let's help Sumeet, Luddy,&rdquo; Lemmy squeaked. &ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;ll
feel better..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Groaning,
the blue haired koopaling let them take the detour.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bridget
got bored with that and spun the knob counterclockwise to the &lsquo;vox&rsquo;
mode.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Birdo shut
tight her blinds to darken the motel somewhat. In Subcon it was
morning and her sleep schedule was already wrecked from traveling the
entire way straight. Her luggage was dropped next to the fluffy cloud
couch she flopped down on. Yoshi&rsquo;s revelations were stinging
but dead-on. Anxiously sitting on the side of the bed when he was on
adventure, the frequent arguments, it all drained her soul. Distanced
from that and the modeling, she&rsquo;d be motivated to take on her
greatest pleasure again, stage performing with her campy theater
crew. Something she&rsquo;d packed was calling to her- or delirium
from guzzled tea was settling in.. She unzipped the hot pink
suitcase. A golden phanto mask was on top of clothes, that other
modeling prop aside from the Bronze Egg.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
relaxed again and made a call to Yoshi. It failed to even ring. He
must be on airplane mode. She shook her head, gaily. No that can&rsquo;t
be it. He was terrified of flying! She wanted it gone like the
abhorrent egg. Who could she call? She tried a fellow influencer..</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Hello,
Kinopio-Kun darling. It&rsquo;s Birdo. I can&rsquo;t reach Yoshi, so
would you like me to mail this artifact over? I used to collect and
I&rsquo;m out of that game. I know you work with brokers.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">....Uh
-Hey! This is Mr. Toad, his boss.&rdquo; He covered over the speaker
and turned to Luigi, looking back expectantly. &ldquo;We have a
museum so send it. By the way have you heard of- Hello?....&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">As a last
ditch effort to see some effect, Bridget turned to the center &lsquo;self&rsquo;
mode, instantly getting thwomped with despair.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He slung
her gear into the hard case, sat for a moment and then screamed. A
cog in their machine she was no more. She ripped off her black combat
helmet. It bounced into the sandpit and her auburn hair was released.
She crushed the radio with her boots. She unsnapped the armor. Freed
from that heavy gear, she felt weightless. All she needed was to fly
in her B-Dasher. -Which was revving up on the park's curb, headlights
on.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jon!&rdquo;
she howled, sprinting through the park. She flipped off the top of
the jungle gym, spun in the air acrobatically and caught the kart by
the bumper.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Then it
sped off.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Her head
banged, completely unlike during a concert like she&rsquo;d dreamed,
against the metal chrome parts as she was dragged around, noxious
gasses from the exhaust choking her. A sharp curve flung her off into
the middle of the road, where another kart swerved around her.
Lifting up painfully, a few bikes went by and pedestrians were on the
street. Without commotion in the city, Mushroomites made up for
missed business very late or stayed out to see the princess return.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
gleaned that rather accurately from the loudmouth on the sidewalk, in
front of the HotFoot Locker.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Good
take?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah.&rdquo;
The other Lakitu brother lowered the camera. They had Mushroom Press
patches.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Now
we're gonna cover that abandoned tank around the block?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His cloud
riding brother nodded, then spun around rapidly as Bridget pushed by.
She found the unattended tank, not preferable and sluggish, moreso
with the Kettle thing strapped to it, the reason she enrolled in the
bring your own vehicle program. She took it anyway, pinching her nose
for the inevitable stank of the interior and made off again. With
knowledge of the city from earlier joy riding, she took a shortcut
through the garden leading to Flower Fields, cut through the pipes to
the tunnels, and intercepted the B-Dasher as it crossed the Shy Guy&rsquo;s
Toy Box amusement park portal.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Stop!!
I need your teapot or I&rsquo;ll become almost unbearable to deal
with!&rdquo; Some crazy guy leapt in front of the tank and wrapped
himself around the gun.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
slammed open the hatch, fuming. &ldquo;The kettle??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The small
alien slid off. A mildly portly shorter grey skinned humanoid, he had
a grubby white doctor's coat, a tin foil hat and thick goggles.
Outside the unmarked eastern building was his ratty medical bag.
Scratches on the door told her he&rsquo;d been lockpicking and
succeeded, as light bled through the sides of the entrance.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-However
you northerners refer to it. You would not want to venture too far up
north anyway, with those psy waves abound. Ah hem. I am Prof. X-Naut,
#1 scientist and secret organization target. Since you are not a
proponent of the powers that be, Ms. Bridget Jane Toad, considering
you reside in Poshley Heights, room 74 at the Inn, I thought you
might be inclined to assist.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Baffled,
she staggered back against the armored vehicle. &ldquo;Hey, dude.
Just.. take it!&rdquo; She released the elastic bands. The one ton
cooking ware slid down the sloped tank edge and flattened him before
she could intervene. &ldquo;Crap.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
no, half capacity is sufficient to nuke the diabolical hideout the
most dangerous covert organization in Toad Town.&rdquo; Prof. X-Naut
chortled, effortlessly slipping right out from underneath. The paper
character flipped upwards, unharmed except a small crease on his top
corner. &ldquo;If SS HQ is not remediated, the documents regarding
Mushroom Flu will be compromised, a fate worser than you can imagine.
I am grateful for your cooperation. You may carry my MacGuffin for
now. It catches Red Chomps in Neon Heights after a player has landed
on the happening space, wearing a Close Call badge. I&rsquo;m Feeling
Fine. No, I did not have an anachronism..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He shoved
a brown leather messenger bag at her, so lightweight it wanted to
lift out of her hands on its own and with a strong hoydenish aroma
she enjoyed more than she should in that brief whiff.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Haha,
you mean aneurysm?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No,
I mean a stroke.&rdquo; The odd little man revealed a golf club and
left her dumbfounded, all the way until she encountered her baby, her
B-Dasher in a wreck a block down.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It was
lodged between concrete poles designed to prevent an outlet from some
E-rated gambling district. The Game Guy alley was a mini Mario Party
board with less than twenty functional spaces and props of a carnival
lining the sides for atmosphere. She winched, zoning in on the
scratched paint. Enraged, she yanked the other guard out of the seat
by the ear, standing over him as he splat flat on the pavement.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Explain.
Com'on. Right now!!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His eyes
fluttered open. &ldquo;Ben called for me. He&rsquo;s out of the
water.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She leaned
up, scowl fading. Jon had to be delusional. The squad wouldn&rsquo;t
keep Benedict&rsquo;s body rotting in Peach's lake, would they?</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Much
excitement and uncertainty alike pooled in the toads waiting under
the canopy of the Mt. Rugged rail station. The usual procedure during
a kidnap was to stick to the castle- an impossibility. Would Princess
Peach be disturbed by how desultory they were and the hijinks that
ensnared them due to that? What about that they&rsquo;d accepted a
new steward from Dark Land that she never met? What of losing
Ala-Gold Wolley Toad following Zoo&rsquo;s attack? A blue toad scaled
down to make a call across the globe. At Ricco Harbor it would be
about sunrise now. He just wanted to talk to someone. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Not them
though. Some rowdy looking shy guys and koopas with red scarves
wrapped around their faces wrestled with their ostros next to the
payphone stall, their steeds spooked wavy northern lights, casting
over crops and fields with a rouge glow. The blue toad dodged behind
a large rock and peered at a clump of lights on the horizon, the city
where it wasn&rsquo;t originating from. Something zipped across his
vision, escaping the gang&rsquo;s clutches.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
impulsively pursued the Mecha-Yoshi rider down into a moo moo pasture
where the robot valleyed in a dip in the ground. The rider hopped off
and pensively examined an open panel on the mecha&rsquo;s neck.
Bucken-Berry tip toed. The stooped low farm animals had him recall an
old sailors superstition from Ala-Gold. That meant a storm was
a-brewin&rsquo; brah. ..But there weren&rsquo;t cows in the ocean and
it was just as likely they were sleepy since it was midnight to the
dot. Bucken-Berry could read the familiar looking analog watch on the
red toad&rsquo;s right wrist- that&rsquo;s how close he was.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey.
Dude.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The other
guy juggled his pda in surprise, just catching it. &ldquo;I
apologize. I struggle with this skittishness when..&rdquo; he
trailed, a spark in his eyes.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wait..
are you-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bucken-Berry
was cut off by a charging debull. Instinctively, he pulled the other
toad away as the beast plowed through the Mecha, mechanical parts
scattering on the farm. All the moo moos were roused into a stampede.
Bucken-Berry snatched the other guy up by his collar and leapt
upwards, bouncing from each one until lobbed over the perimeter
together, where a big googie styled city limits billboard cast light
on them with its mix of working and blown out lightbulbs. Painted
purple, it stated &lsquo;Area 64 Starts Here&rsquo;. A little ways
down was an army camp with a fire, tents, parked Dry-Bomber tanks.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bucken-Berry&rsquo;s
heart skipped a beat. Not hunched over some screen with a white coat
on, that red toad was even taller and more lively with his blond wavy
medium length hair down. His revealed undershirt was tailored short
sleeved button up, a sky blue with a shine sprite pattern printed on.
Striking black tribal tattoos wrapped around both arms. Another layer
of intrigue regarding Zoo&rsquo;s..freakin&hellip;brother.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
freaking knew it,&rdquo; the blue toad hissed. &ldquo;What even put
you out here??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">My
myopic ways. Anyway, thank you Bucken-Berry,&rdquo; he replied,
suppressing inflection. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m intact to handle
something long overdue-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hold
on!&rdquo; The blue toad caught up. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Drew L.
Diddley, artist of.. Whatever this word means. Take the thing.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
had a flicker of something and then slipped &rsquo;Assemblation&rsquo;
into his back jeans pockets. &ldquo;That classic.. I supposed the
signature on the back uncovered some oddities. That I am of half toad
and boo lineage and that Zoo Diddley, yes my younger psychotic
sibling, owned it. I will explain it all some other time if we&hellip;
exchange numbers,&rdquo; he beamed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Not
thinking, Bucken-Berry agreed. He glanced from the digits on the slip
of paper and back up- the doctor had teleported almost a third of the
way up the ladder of this bulb shaped water tower, shimmering silver
in the moonlight. Bucken-Berry dashed to the barbed fence around it.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">HEY!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Maintain
your distance!&rdquo; Dr. Toad advised, still sounding pleased with
himself and continuing to climb.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah,
right, the blue toad spat. He&rsquo;d just jump that tiny gate thing.
Backing up for a running start, he trampled on something hidden in
tumbleweeds. He kicked some dislodged battery pack.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thanks,
could we please have that, Blue Toad?&rdquo; The polite inquirer had
a sweet little voice, Darklandian accented.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He brushed
against Lemmy Koopa, stature stretched out a lot, glowing like the
environment.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Eek
a.. I mean.. Koopa freak. Your scheme failed bro! Piss off!!!!&rdquo;
he shook a fist.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Shrieking,
Lemmy retreated behind Iggy, on his knees twisting a screwdriver at a
heap of something that had crash landed. Ludwig was tapping a foot,
busy with scrolls, and they all had a glow matching the astral
phenomena. Before he got to walloping, a fourth person was revealed
when a stubby arm rose from a dented up water trough. They reached
over, and a snufit exhaustively spilled out of it, panting.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">State..the..
Emergency. Snifit Patrol&hellip; at.. Your.. service..
Citizen..Oof..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bucken-Berry
marched to the officer. &ldquo;What the heck is going on?!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy Delta
rose. &ldquo;My Transporter-To-Convenient-Plotpoint-Location DLC
downloaded!&rdquo; he triumphantly announced. &ldquo;Except I
prematurely blasted this area with intense gamma rays when there was
no distress signal, only a blinking theater spotlight. And it was to
the wrong plot point.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy did
a twirling gesture at his ear.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Reserve
that for me, Lemmy, for your shell is green and Ignatius orange, you
six feet two, Ignatius four in a half, among other discrepancies in
your physical appearances!&rdquo; Ludwig commented.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Aaahhh!...Oh
my God, our bodies are swapped! Or our heads. Or something!&rdquo;
Lemmy screamed with Iggy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The woozy
officer whipped between the two. &ldquo;At least Ludwig and I came
out unscathed.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thank
the stars. I cannot tolerate any more setbacks!&rdquo; However
instead of walking off in a huff, the blue haired koopaling
inexplicably inched on the ground like a worm&hellip;in a huff.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ho
ho.. Let me find an incident report slip,&rdquo; Snifit Patrol
sighed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The water
tower seemed like the normal option to Bucken-Berry after all.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
breached the hull of the disguised spaceship, larger on the inside,
the interior a mid century living room on side, mad lab the other .
Puzzled at something else present, his eyebrows lowered.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Did
Houdini Toadley conspire with you? I wonder what quenched his
reservations about Miracle Cures..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well..
first of all. Hi, I&rsquo;m Daisy. Princess Daisy Bloom.&rdquo; The
human women had one leg over the other, gaming in Morris&rsquo;
wicker chair. She dropped a game machine into her lap, Pac-Man played
all the way to the kill screen.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
certainly are.&rdquo; Dr. Toad snatched the precious object from the
counter, what he had to conceal, Zoo&rsquo;s diary. That anxiety
clamping at him subsided as it was apparent no one had touched it.
He&rsquo;d never leave it here safekeeping again, not when the x-naut
insisted he never took the ship out of his hangar on the Moon when he
clearly did.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
know this is off topic but, just been to Pinna Park or something?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He felt
the tag from the gift shop on his shirt. Except on the </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">inside</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">.
&ldquo;Princess..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daisy
tacked on, &quot;I got x-ray vision now cause of those rays in junk.
Anyway, yeah Dr. Toadley visited, my people found me and I had to
hide somewhere. People be crazy here, yo.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No
way-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bucken-Berry
burst the hatch open. &ldquo;-Drew watch out there&rsquo;s bad guys
and&hellip; Daisy, you&rsquo;re up??! I mean great but-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
backed into the buffet, mirthfully. &ldquo;I presume you are immune
to heavy radiation after all.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The blue
toad stared blankly. &ldquo;No I ain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
plummeted all the way to the ground and curled up, trembling.
Lightning flashed out of nowhere. They gathered around, Daisy
staggered out, the ranchers and the ostros gaped, King&rsquo;s guards
a mile away snagged binoculars and Thomas at the station was awoken.
Iggy Delta obsequiously faced his brothers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Guess
who'll go back to beta testing from now on?&quot;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Shape
up. We'll go there, alright?&quot; she explained softly, the other
guard's head in her lap. His tears soaked her pants and tank top.
Jon's deterioration was shocking, draining every ounce of
combativeness out of the GI. She stood him up. &quot;We can even play
this board game thing to get through the alley.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
proceeded on to the blue space. Three coins popped out, making her
gasp. She saved face, cooly scooping coinage. &quot;Brilliant.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jon held
his helmet against his hip and groaned, &quot;Let's play this 'ting.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The next
space, a Game Guy spot, didn't do anything. Bridget ignorantly chose
a red space, penalized by the coins poofing into dust. The Bowser was
even worse. With the real guy unavailable, a Bowser Statue spawned
out of mid air and crushed her before phasing away.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
know nuthin 'bout Mario Party,&quot; Jon snarked at her back.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
exasperatedly explained the basics, almost like his old self. They
only hit good spaces onward, Bridget enjoying herself while Jon
lumbered at her heels. They escaped the Game Guy gala, marched
through the dead flower fields, up the steep incline of Royal Raceway
and to where elevation leveled off. It was so hazy over castle
grounds, and so unexpectedly frosty, all they could see that castle
parts were hovering around, joining on their own with uncanny
precision.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Stunned,
Jon snapped a photo with the standard issue polaroid. It developed
and, though they couldn't see it with their naked eye, there was a
white boo hanging around. The castle was known to keep a few of
those, not to mention that killer was one, so they marched off
quickly, so much so they triggered a happening space. Tweester
spawned, forcing gale force winds down the alley. The leathered bag
containing the MacGuffin was launched high in the sky along with
them, dumped out into an adjacent street. Bridget whacked a mail
receptacle. She grimaced from impact and through her teary eyes, she
spotted Prof X-Naut's bag drift into the ether.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Bloody
wonderful,&quot; she said as Jon found her again. Whatever he'd
whacked into, it gave him a black eye.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Why
you freaking out?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;That
was important. I think.&quot; She shrugged if off. &quot;Well, we got
photo evidence of that row back there at least. Here's how the hustle
can go. We avoid cops for now and-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;And
that one too?&quot; he asked, looking over her head.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Someone
yawned behind them, a boo wearing a floppy blue and yellow stared
sleeping cap, floating under the flickering street lamp. The green
Bowser racket hung from their dominant hand, also with a matching
sleeping cap stretched over it. Their hair rose. It couldn't be. Must
of stepped on a boo space back there.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Steal
coins or a Star?&quot; Their eyes then blotted out white for a flash.
&quot;Let me start over. Thought I was.. Working my dismal summer job
in that Game Guy board a block down..&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh,
we can go then-&quot; Jon backed off the sidewalk.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Stop,&quot;
they zoned in on him, freezing him. &quot;I AM who you think. I. Am,
hehe. You want to see Benedict again, don't you?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Y-yeah..?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The boo
swiveled to the other. &quot;And you want&hellip;Trevor Buddy, my
neighbor. Ah, he's not home. Guess that means he broke his promise to
you, yes, even with all of those texts you've sent. &quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She just
resisted going off on that perspicacious creep. &quot;Hey. It's
deeper than you think kid. Let's go Jon.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Not
yet. Let me grant your wishes. To escape.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They wound
their arm up, it obvious what they were about to do with the racket
in those microseconds. Bridget was paralyzed, yet Jon smiled
peacefully, unwavering until he was sliced. With a sickening crack
the frame wedged in the middle of his exposed helmetless forehead. A
thin line of blood ran down and dripped off his chin. The boo
unjammed it from the slot it carved and he crumpled on the spot he
stood, the smack of his split open head on the sidewalk splattering
the other guard's boot with brain matter.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She broke
out of the daze and fired her zapper from her hip, possibly the best
shot in her thirty-four years, a perfect shot between the boo's
widening eyes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~Ladies
and gentleman, we got 'em. No one put a scratch on the toad killer
but her, and all she had to do was become some vagrant that had seen
too much. Oh, and dodge. She didn't during the retaliatory swing of
the racket racket. Bashed flatly in the face, there was a snap, her
lifeless body fell backwards before the entrance of SS HQ</font></p>

the blistering headache made them wobble. Boo phased into the Super

not even as, in their semi conscious state, they phased through the

<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">By a
miracle of Eldstar, Yoshi soared over the desert dunes beyond Toad
Town, but he&rsquo;d lost against the clock. Trepidation seeped into
his system, piloting on pure visuals, unable to determine altitude
with the terrain a black sea. He turned the radio up, again for
response. The cockpit was filled with the sound of banging metal,
then a plunk.</font></p>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There were
all sorts of zapping noises, followed by the flop of something heavy.</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Good
job, Spy Guy!&rsquo;</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No

it Charles. Hey, N, uh, this guy.. See them papers on Mushroom Flu?&rsquo;&rsquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi&rsquo;s
heart raced. Why would that be at this fake airport?</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">N,
he&rsquo;s getting up!&rsquo;</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">My

<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yes
you will. Yoink! By the way, all of you, including the bandit in the
full body cast that has purposefully laid on the remote the entire
time, broadcasting all audio live from this secret base as we speak,
have been out of it for the last five minutes due to my Startrooper
mind trick.&lsquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Noooo!&rdquo;
several bellowed under the sound of hot steam.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi&rsquo;s
gaze darted to the clock. There was an incision in his memory of the
last five minutes.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Wow,
I&rsquo;m numb all over but alive..&rdquo; hoarsely babbled someone
under Yoshi, securing the yoke. &ldquo;Some Startrooper mind trick
must have woke me up.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
sprung off his lap. &ldquo;Sonny, my goodness..&rdquo; In his own
state of frenzy, he planted himself in the jumpseat behind. &ldquo;Not
to divulge what I shouldn&rsquo;t, but the pilot abandoned us on
purpose and your uh, &lsquo;base&rsquo; has a nutjob attacking it
right now.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Emerson,
already groggy, deflated with familiarity. &ldquo;Mr. Munchakoopas,
hate to pull a dejavu, but brace.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A peak of
Mt. Rugged was in their path. The aircraft lurched nose up, with a
crunch following somewhere around the tail section, and a sharp veer
downwards. The toad adjusted the flaps at the last moment. They
glided erratically, avoiding another plateau. There were bursts of
orange and yellow speckling the ground from warfare. Then some
humongous creature pulled the plane out of the sky, it&rsquo;s grasp
crushing in the fuselage. The awkward angle made Yoshi tumble
backwards into the cabin. A red slit pupil was trying to search
inside.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><b>SUP,
YOSH! Lemme set this down nice and easy- OWW..</b></font>&rdquo;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A missile
made the creature drop the plane, sticking dino to the ceiling until
impact. Yoshi came to with flames dancing all around him, metallic
scraps and loose debris pitched across the land, and crops ablaze.
Gradually voices faded in. His throat seized from the nauseous fumes
and billowing smoke, crawling on sharp parts, gravitated to his son&rsquo;s
barking, treading embers until colliding with reeds and grass. He was
doused immediately by Snifit Patrol with a garden hose stretched taut
from the train station.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
rolled onto his back, panting, facing red tinted stars. He rolled,
observing beyond Poochy shaking water from singed fur. Tanks and
black spotted mushroom guards were fighting some Kaiju that vaguely
resembled a toad and even more vaguely looked like Bucken-Berry, the
fight veering away from the mountain.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thoughts
of pilot &lsquo;Emerson Lake Toad&rsquo; (he kept reiterating so it
couldn&rsquo;t dissipate, hoping his revival wasn&rsquo;t a dream all
along) swarmed his mind under the locomotive horn blasting.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
burned rubber to show up, weaving through the armory, Snifit Patrol,
and with the aroma of popcorn and cheap theater, only stopped by her
staff blocking the station&rsquo;s entrance with their jaws on the
floor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here at the expected arrival time!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette,
don&rsquo;t you see what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; Joseph looked at
her funny. &ldquo;Even I heard the explosions.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She paled,
taking a gander. &ldquo;Oh.. heavens. Really hyper focused there,&rdquo;
she signed and spoke simultaneously.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Thank
you.&rdquo; Peach swept the parcel straight from her fingers. The
princess had squeezed out the K64 before the squeaky doors completely
opened.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The pink
toad tagged along, appalled at her condition. &ldquo;Princess are you
okay?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
monarch simply nodded as she marched, stumbled rather, down the
mountain path the way Toadette just came, equally as imperturbable.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
uncomfortably put on a smile for the staff. &ldquo;It appears I
learned from the best.&rdquo;</font></p>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She'd
committed to hiding, now she might as well seek or try to, backing
off from the last of three green buttons. The labels were in her
native language, not too weird in a spaceship as much as aliens loved
to stalk around Sarasaland. It was the translations making her leery,
saying stuff like... 'Do not put under children of 3 years.'
'Carefully slip and fall?' 'Infinite pleasure?'</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Meanwhile
disturbances outside were generating deep percussive booms, rattling
the world. They had to safely relocate using one of the buttons and
levers scattered around the living arrangements. In desperation Daisy
smacked the other two options, making that machine that had fallen on
the floor spark to life and cough up dozens of screws and
unidentified parts. The lights blinked, though there was no cord or
power source.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After
tying his blonde hair back to regain some appearance of
professionalism, Dr. Toad heaved the machine back on the lab table.
&quot;Of course. Morris fully embraces his paper form! Princess, I
suggest you depart while you can. I'd loathe to get you in trouble
with Mr. X.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well, if
only he knew that firstly, she'd already heard of Mr. X, he like the
aliens hung around her desert land, (though unlike the aliens he
would ask for permissions in long detailed letters) and secondly that
she </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">loathed</font></em>
<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">to let
'Peachy' down way more.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Don't
worry about it doc. He recognized my name and sent me down here, but
otherwise it ain't nothing, and he especially got nothing to do with
the artifacts in my backyard and little jerks like Zoo Diddley using
them... But you've hardly heard of that.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No I
wouldn't..&quot; Dr. Toad murmured, quickly requesting the first tech
support he could on the pda.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A proudly
licensed technician beamed in, wearing a blue logo embroidered polo
and matching ballcap. &quot;Greetings, Iggy of Nerd Squad here!&quot;
The cyborg koopaling's ocular sensors retracted at the scenery.
&quot;Oooooh crap,&quot; he mouthed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
opened his wallet. &quot;Repair this please.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy
accepted the coins, wary of a princessy death glare from behind.
&quot;Sure! I'll, uh, proceed with the emergency call, only this is a
liiiiittle short of my new rates. Sure I no longer need to sleep and
can teleport anywhere, but I can't be a charity while saving up for
the upcoming PlayStation-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
shoved more at him and pushed him before the sparking and grinding
fax, its death throes. Iggy skittishly unrolled a tool kit and began.
The toad doctor was so engrossed as the koopaling sorted disassembled
bits with expertise, he didn't notice that there were five angry
Hiyoihoi, moai secret service agents, cornering them against the lab
table with huge rocks dwarfing the tall pencil thin geeks.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hold
up! That guy caused this stuff!&quot; Daisy fussed, commanding their
attention across the table with a shaking fist.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The toad
doctor shrugged. &quot;I suppose I had a more fluid idea of heroes
and villains and what they do in their off time.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
princess's fist froze. &quot;Yeah, it is weird when we're fine one
moment and fighting the next week. Go on. Long as Bowser and his
folks aren't being a nuisance and kidnapping people.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Who
hasn't?&quot; Dr. Toad covered his mouth. Thankfully Iggy's eureka
moment was the prominent spectacle.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
eighteen year old raised a mangled up sheet of paper from the feed.
Cleaning his glasses- &quot;OMG. It's Dr. Mario's, page one of
five-thousand!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
snatched it up, scintillating as if holding Gold Bar x3, if
short-lived. &quot;&hellip;We should move out of the way of 4999.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Every
document stuck in limbo was unleashed machine gun style, pages
knocking some of them off their feet worse. The lamp was struck at
the base, crying 'OUCH!'. The others dove for cover until the
whirling fax machine slowed down for a full HD color print out.
Spying through the gaps in the wicker chair he'd ducked behind, Dr.
Toad witnessed the shoes, pants, white coat, and ultimately head of
Prof. Morris X-Naut roll out, floating tranquility to the orange shag
carpet.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;That's
for disregarding my PhD in revenge, secret agents!&quot; He flipped
upward, fists raised until his younger toad friend tapped him on the
shoulder, unenthused. The space alien quickly shaped up, hands behind
his back. &quot;I didn't waste eighteen hours for folly, Drew.. Oh
look, I remembered to send Dr. Mario's notes ahead of myself in the
queue, freshly starched.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A camera
flashed from an unknown location.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Wow
oh wow. In the nick of time, the missing professor and the Mushroom
Flu notes are found WITH the assistance of a koopaling behind the
pandemic? Scoop of the CENTURY!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
unnoticed lamp removed its shade, revealing a baggy eyed Kylie Koopa,
unaffected by the nasty paper cut on her knees. &quot;Iggy fella, was
that redemption planned?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
koopaling ripped off the shirt, puffing out his chest. &quot;Yes!
This is my arc, my true destiny! Super Mercenary Iggy Delta&hellip;
Desu!&quot; Kylie snapped more of him before she was tackled by
Daisy's servants.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I'll
uh, ack! *cough* I'll change names in the reports!&quot; The reporter
gasped from the bottom of the pile up. &quot;PLEASE! At least share
the findings with MK East tonight!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Fine!
Huff!&quot; Prof X-Naut groaned loudly. He pulled down an industrial
looking lever with the most alarming Engrish statement yet, 'Enjoy
your fright'. Everyone felt a centrifugal force.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jr.
Troopa's phone was on silent while waving his brightest torch around
the darkness, the magnitude of the wreckage scarily impressive for an
aircraft that could have fit in his parent's garage. He wouldn't want
to look like some distracted, technology bound young adult in front
of such a big shot observing his efforts. Fragments of shrapnel were
still warm as he picked through, trying his best. No toad pilot or
tackle box. Tail between his legs, the paratroopa showed the gauze
wrapped dinosaur fragments of a bronze object.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;The
rest must have gotten up and walked away.&quot; He adjusted his
ten-gallon, remaining shorter than the dinosaur. &quot;That good or
bad?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
fixed the face he was making. &quot;-It's great! I appreciate it.&quot;
He accepted what was left of the Bronze Egg, mouth tightening. Sonny
being some secret agent couldn't have made him immune to injury,
furthermore this made an unidentified body unaccounted for twice.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A kart
circumvented the koopa, yoshi, and reluctantly leashed poochy on the
rural stroll to civilization, suspension squeaking from rough
terrain.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The window
rolled down. &quot;Mr. Munchakoopas, I know you are eager to join
Mario. Hop in.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jr. Troopa
felt for his pop gun at the sight of Captain Toad. It was one of
those hair on the back of the neck raising feelings someone like Drew
his, uh ex, would disregard. Well it was a thing, Troopa was as
certain of it as he was that the sun would rise in a few hours. That
toad would be stopped tonight.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Or, would
have. The buzzing in his pocket was unbearable, keeping him from
popping a tire. Calls from all over flooding in, a real flying saucer
sweeping above. He turned around and- ZOOM, rocked out of his cowboy
boots.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mushroomites
in slippers and night caps clambered to windows or poured from
darkened homes onto the streets to get a glimpse at their sovereign,
cheering at her return. This continued without letup all the way to
the chokepoint of Royal Raceway. Peach separated from the Cloud 9 of
the Lakitu Bros and continued with the assistance of an aide,
discovering her castle exactly how it used to be. The painted white
stone was radiant in the moonlight, pink roof tiles unblemished,
wrap-around sandstone driveway immaculate. The only blotch of her
opulent abode was perhaps that the mysterious contractor did not get
to the lawn yet, patchy parched grass, zero arrangements, and the
gnome Ksitigarbha missing- that and there were a dozen pipe frame
carts lined up and waiting.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Princess,
er.. Surprise!&rdquo; The approaching black spotted toad tipped their
officer&rsquo;s cap. Like an ant trooper infestation, they could
never shake these pests!</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
slid from behind Peach, scrutinizing &lsquo;Warden Dylan&rsquo;
closely, uniformed in dark blue like a typical police force-
blatantly not the original wave of King&rsquo;s officers. While they
might not have faced Booigi&rsquo;s wrath, they and the rest of the
squad interestingly had a few minor scuffs and scrapes. &ldquo;How
did you do it??&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Our
squadron arrived only an hour ago, after completion. You are not to
question the King, steward. He&rsquo;s already spoken.&rdquo; They
revealed a note, once tapped to the doors. It was the official
parchment with the seal, handwritten in the middle with cursive: </font>
</p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Gift
from your future KING.&rsquo; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With the
celebrating crowd catching up and washing the rest of her friends in,
there was no peace to ponder anything. The interior, some of their
old belongings, the leaky faucet in the basement, all restored to a
level of convincing detail. Toad was the last to arrive &lsquo;home&rsquo;,
the vision from the Vrlrdyi scope zombifying his gait more than
usual. This castle wasn&rsquo;t was he saw spring from nothingness,
but he wished it was so there would be less questions. The King was
once known for his mastery over bricks, the famous brown kind, via
his scepter, a major player in his great post WW63 kingdom expansion.
</font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
Castle did not contain those bricks however&hellip;</font></em></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
okay?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
blinked at Mario, completely alone in the doorway. &ldquo;Totally&hellip;&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The red
plumber told the lingering guards to hightail it and they did, eager
to do so as there was something coming, huge. Civilian stragglers
fled as a three headed eel monster, larger than an Unagi anyone had
seen, slithered onto castle grounds, its glistening blue skin
emitting a radioactive red glow.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><b>Heeeeelp!!!
Don&rsquo;t let them blow me up Mr. Toadsworth!!!</b> </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Only a few
feet from the open doorway, the elder&rsquo;s tea cup slipped from
his grasp. &ldquo;T-the m-monster w-was a t-toad, eh wot?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><b>I
don't look like a toad anymore?&rdquo;</b></font> <font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
middle head swiveled back and forth with the other heads. &ldquo;</font><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><b>We
don't?&rdquo;</b></font> <font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">asked
the leftmost head. &rdquo;</font><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><b>I&rsquo;ll
do a trick. Cool Blue style. Somebody come here,&rdquo;</b></font>
<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">said the
right, seizing control. &ldquo;</font><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><b>I
will..</b></font> <font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">try
to speak normally. I respect privacy.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
stepped up, protectively closing the entrance door partially behind
him.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Curtis
Mario, you secretly sold your castle after Luigi won his mansion.
That&rsquo;s why it never shows up in games anymore. Months after the
incident, every time you heard a boo cackle you&rsquo;d wet-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
plumber spun back in, petrified. &ldquo;This is definitely our Mario
encyclopedia- I mean Bucken-Berry.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
heavens. What will we do with you?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mr.
Toadsworth um.. Closer. Sam, can I say that? Your secret is..oh
weird.&rdquo; Slit pupils thinning out, the nostrils of all three
heads flared open. &ldquo;You smell like death.. I can&rsquo;t
describe it. Is this a trick?? I wanted Toadsworth, you phony!&rdquo;
Their spines rose, and their cheeks filled from something amber. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The old
mushroom man screamed madly, retreating behind Mario. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
unstable and about to-!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hot lava
deluged the lobby, leaving Mario and co scrambling out of the way.
They gawked from the mezzanine at the searing pool, melting all of
the princess&rsquo;s furniture on ground level, the podium, her
chairs, the sun rug.. The curtains caught fire and heat bulged out
and shattered many of the windows. Peach burst open the upper level
doors, breathing rapidly in her nightgown. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">This
is why I have no choice but to welcome my father tomorrow.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Later in
those early hours, Toad snuck out, easily from this lonely third
floor, wondering what the heck was going on with two folks. What
freaked Bucken-Berry out? He waited at the lake until mosquitos
drained a quarter of his blood. No answer. Okay, then what happened
to Luigi on the way? Again nothing, at least by text.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">During the
rescue parade, Luigi diverted to the precinct upon catching stray
chatter of Boo being held there. He found the desk unoccupied in the
ex-fast food joint. No ostentatious if earnest Snifit Patrol,
bumbling but kind Inspector Douglas, or grouchy but diligent Sergeant
Howie. Luigi wandered around until at a hard corner, where an array
of bars lined both sides of a hallway. He was drawn to a casted foot
sticking out of one cell. Turns out it was only the cast. A cot was
left behind and lots of wrappings on it, like the person crawled out
and got away. The messily written note on the ground, on the back of
a receipt for a shoe polish store, confirmed such.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">'Yeah
mane, I been healed up and bounced like SSHQ always do. Coming back
for the captain too, like it or not. -0069'</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;The
heck?&quot; he thought out loud, pouring over the rest of the cell.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Imprisoned
was possibly that captain, a middle aged yoshi businessman on the
bench. Sitting up, he had a hauntingly blank stare, drool from the
side of his open mouth creating a puddle. Last was Boo Diddley in the
corner, facing the concrete wall. A sliver of moonlight from the
window hit them partially, illuminating exactly half of them from the
back down to the tail.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He grabbed
the bars, relief wafting over him. &quot;Buddy! I made it. Bowser was
taken care of. Everything's better, okay?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Barely
perceptible, they squeaked, &quot;Is it, Luigi?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Perspicaciously,
something made him step back. &quot;Comparatively. I realize what led
to what the columnists are calling your 'day of retribution' hasn't
been dealt with. Just bear with me. To be brutally honest, I'm
learning as the champion of the kingdom that there are a lot of
issues beneath the fa&ccedil;ade we have of being so far ahead of the
others and 'better'. I get it, but Peach had to be our priority or we
couldn't have even begun. Do you get it?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He let go,
the pressure from his hands fogging the steel. A belated thought hit
him. Why hadn't boo gotten out of here? It would surely be easier for
them than whoever 'cot and wrappings' person was. They must be ridden
with guilt right? Or-</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Luigi.
Yes. This entire time.. Something got into me.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The boo
slowly rotated, making the green plumber's smile fade. Boo had a
puncture, a perfectly centered head wound and gazing into it,
something was escaping, impalpable, and clawing out for him. During
his studies with Prof. E. Gadd, the mentor himself only had the
briefest notes on this arcane phenomenon of the boo, the usual
possessor, being possessed, creating a psionic vacuum.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;And
now it's getting out of you,&quot; he sputtered.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
glided closer. &quot;I'll be brutally honest too&hellip; No wait.
I'll just be brutal.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Back
against the opposite bars, Luigi steeled himself. His mind had to be
a fortress against the wicked rays, except like the real thing,
cracks were inevitable. &quot;Why?&quot; he croaked, sliding to the
floor, eyes propped open. To resist was muscle tearing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
are in love with a toad.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A response
crawled out of his throat, the rest of him disintegrating from the
top down. &quot;I..don't know that yet, Boo!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Booigi.
Boo is somewhere safe, and I know you don't. This was a warning. You
won't get another.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He got
out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">How?</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And out of
what?</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The green
plumber wasn't sure. He was somewhere in his own grassy yard. One
lamp on in a window. Gill T's abode next door still dark and empty
and the other house on the opposite side still for sale. An early
morning paper thwacked him in the back.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad Town
News: MK Hospital East and South join peacefully at Peach's Stadium,
curing all Mushroom Flu patients with custom Dr. Mario patented
mega-vitamin. Special thanks to: International Medical University of
Special World, Princess Daisy Bloom, Ignatius H Koopa, and an
anonymous local reporter.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">....</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And that
was it. The castle would have rather they'd overshared like usual.
Every bit of their routine wouldn't be so off kilter this morning.
Joseph flung the covers off his bunk bed, oversleeping with his
special alarm clock not vibrating the bed. Peach's car keys were thus
misplaced in weeds, then the trip to the market took forever. The
washing machine was overloaded and bubbles filled the castle,
breakfast items were missing like the butter, jammin jelly etc,
despite Chef Tim's best effort and so on. The topic of Kinopio-Kun
arose from nowhere. Toadette kept her head down, blushed. They
understandably didn't understand his decision, but she shelved white
knighting him for the moment. Toadsworth looked horrible.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The heavy
star patterned blankets just swallowed him up nearly. The only time
his hoarse voice was heard was when asking the adjacent toad, Thomas,
to rip open a box of something, the label marked out. The kid's head
was barely above the table level, picking at the mushrooms on the
china silently. No one put on a particularly strong display that they
had this under control except for one, and sliding his clean plate
away, he was about to leave.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Don't
worry. I'll beat Elderberry back.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadsworth
nodded at Peach with some coded expression.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Mr.
Toad, wait a moment.&quot; The princess gently patted her face with a
napkin. &quot;We are ready to see the message!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A King's
officer stepped in, impervious to all of the scathing or alarmed
glances. They held a tablet fixed to a virtual meeting, the person on
the other end represented by a B symbol. The toads crowded around as
the camera cut on, revealing Bowser! His background indicated Dark
Land with a red sky and volcanoes, though no castle was in sight, his
troops bustling around in the distance from under temporary tents.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Bwa
ha ha! It is I, King Bowser! I bet you and your dumb toads are rarely
surprised by stuff, so here's a treat. We started it, and we ended
it. Check your papers. We, the Koopa Troop, take (partial..)
responsibility for curing the Mushroom Flu! &hellip;I don't know how
you got a castle already and NOT ME! But whatever, all we want for
payment is.. Not to kidnap you but..&quot; Someone off screen
whispered, Bowser responding with a subdued groan. &quot;Alright, we
want all your old treasures.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;NO!&quot;
Peach replied, scaring some in the kitchen into flipping plates into
the air.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Their
savior was another user hopping on. Mario and Luigi were on a couch
at their home, identified easily by the game collection displayed
behind them. Mario was animatedly speaking with Luigi beside him, an
ice pack on his head and a whole lot else off, at least Toad noticed
right away.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Mario,
you're muted!&quot; Toad said.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sheepishly
the plumber reached around the screen. &quot;Got it. Bowser, you were
supposed to get on with us first. How did you threaten them so far?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
didn't do nuthin!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Cut
it out. You wanna get wrecked twice in twenty-four hours?&quot; Luigi
snipped, the directness of this tone having immediate effect.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
was just throwing out facts&hellip; According to YOUR news! It's my
son worried about some artifact deal..&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Vater,
be discreet!&quot; cried that person off screen again.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadsworth
in the far rear wavered. &quot;What is his progress?&quot; he asked
Zeror to ask the tablet, deferring attention. The green toad tried to
speak up, unable to succeed with the topic moving on.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;So,
we're hunky dory right?&quot; Mario whistled for someone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;What
up what up!&quot; Daisy sat on Luigi's side, in some baggy casual
clothing, not what she wore at the game, nor the hospital smock
they'd expect.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Then Yoshi
flopped down next to Mario, waving. Below at his knees Poochy circled
around, wagging.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Figured
we'd all want to see each other before splitting off,&quot; Mario
began, his cheery tone not fooling anyone. &quot;After all, once
Peach's dad gets here...&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;...What,
Mario?&quot; she asked, leaning in.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Well,
he'll be a handful won't he?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario left
it like that. Possibly he caught on that a King's guard was in
proximity, or he was behaving appropriately because it was like that.
This was why her adoration for him would never wane, no matter how
much she knew it wasn't as perfect a match as most believed, or how
much she was starting to think of someone else on the Zoom call.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Someone
tiptoed across the molten rock in the lobby, inconveniently blocking
the basement (something to deal with later since the leak wasn't
fixed..). Sun rays reached castle grounds early from the fissure in
Star Hill and, he thanked the stars, no guards were hanging around
anymore. He rushed to the street, carefully dodging mud with his nice
shoes. A sail equipped New Donk City cab should have been there for a
quick in and out. It wasn't. He sent a text every minute nagging, in
the process finding a message from his doctor about the need for a
pacemaker. Way to make him feel his age, just before he met his
Special One at a special place..</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-HI-YAA-
*cough* I mean, sup Mr. Toad ova there.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He glanced
up at the gang.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No
trouble here, man. Just lookin!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Her
place's really back!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
know. I'm tripping.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The red,
black, yellow, and green ninjas ogled every inch of the property.
They had been working hard it appeared, sweaty, with tool belts on
their hips and fluorescent construction hats, quite a career change
for a once vicious Koopa Troop aligned gang.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Are
you fixing the basement?!&quot; he yelled over.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The black
one, Eggplant, twisted around. &quot;We're temps for all that
construction going on downtown so no, old man. Call a private
contractor.&quot; The bros snickered.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad let
them be, gravitating to his reflection in the murky lake. He hadn't
worn a suit since the Mario All-Stars event, adding to it a top hat
and carrying hooked white cane. He looked spiffy!.. If he kept
repeating it. Better go for this now prove to himself he's not lost
it, than wonder, have nerves eat him alive while also dealing with
Peach's father for a week or more. Some rowdiness made his ears perk.
He rolled his eyes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;WOOO!
Catch!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Over
here! Over here!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yep, the
Koopa Bros were cooling off in the moat. Whatever except- Toad
thought he was imagining. Their 'ball' arcing in the air was one of
their precious lost garden gnomes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He rolled
his sleeves up. &quot;I'm gonna kill em..&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With each
step closer, a ninja was mysteriously pulled under. Something moved
swiftly downstream and a second later, a pile of koopa bones shot
onto land.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
staggered to the shore. &quot;WHY? AHHH!&quot; All of the shell
colors were there, with ribs, skulls, femurs.. He went green, queasy
as the surface undulated. It was right there. &quot;Uh, hey. Let's
talk&hellip; We'll tell Peach it was a mistake okay?... And weren't
you vegan?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Three
pairs of red eyes became visible from the deep. Toad braced-</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-I'm
sorry Mr. Toad. I hadn't had breakfast and.. I don't know anymore!
Just let me go. Fire me!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The Earl
breathed out slowly, still alive- for then. &quot;Yvan, we're working
on you. Ignore Samuel and don't talk like that..&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
impression he got that the steward wept became stronger when he
ascended a little ways up, baleful form curled into a ball. Despite
that the words of the once blue toad, in his normal tone, came out
clear and blunt enough to give Toad a concussion. &quot;Like I can
recover from this when I can't fit in the castle or not accidentally
kill somebody? Like I wasn't already something of a freakazoid
before, never acting how toads are supposed to act??&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The suited
toad buttoned and unbuttoned the end of his dress coat over and over.
&quot;Look, about that-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-I
don't know how you got your immunity to act any sorta way. Pretty
sure my luck was used up surviving the first bout of gamma rays and
crap, since the way I am now is the outcome of the second-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Stop
there-&quot; Toad cut him off. &quot;Bro. No, there's nothing to envy
with me. At least when you lost your family, they loved you.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He thought
he perceived the slits in the water widening. &quot;What are you
talking about?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
slipped off the increasingly constricting dress coat. &quot;I never
got away with being 'different' at all. Peach doesn't know why I
stuck around when the nobles left with the King. Think I told her
that I got lost or something. No, besides not agreeing with anything
they stood for, I wasn't into toads. See, I was born in some special
sequence or something, they had high expectations, and that dashed
it. 'Oh no I'm not going to make clones of myself'! I was still
disturbed by that man, for years, wishing to the stars I wasn't the
only Toad banished to his own native kingdom. But nothing could
change that- or me. You get it?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;...Wow.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad tied
on a super cape, cathartic, feeling energized enough to just fly out
of there if he had a running start. &quot;What do you think's
actually your problem? Being weird or whatever doesn't count
anymore.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;...It's
dumb.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Go
on.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Like,
not going 'too far'. Keeping my power in check, I guess, in whatever
form I'm in.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No
that's perfect. And mature.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Really?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;And
we'll work on that. Hang in there. I'll be back before it gets bad. I
promise, alright?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Quite a
bit daunted, the monster watched the cape feathered toad take off
like a little jet in the sky. He sighed, somehow less miserable than
he began.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Alright.&quot;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A blur
from the other side of the world beat the Sunset Express on full
steam to the Tangerino Grill, a famed one paint star restaurant with
contemporary styling, two floors, and a luxurious VIP area. The cape
wearer scoped it out when his date appeared out of nowhere, pointing
upwards and- BAM! Colliding with a billboard, he plummeted below,
bouncing off the roof, an open umbrella at an outside table, and in
the midst of all the tourists from the arriving train, getting
trampled.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Toad!&quot;
They parted through toads to assist him, readjusting his top hat.
&quot;People wait for months for a reservation. Don't die before our
name's called.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He still
didn't know what made the plumber in the tuxedo so extra snarky, but
he loved it. &quot;Totally.&quot; Toad, after coughing up dirt,
offered a stringy purple piranha flower, mailed in super early today
from </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">SPACE</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">.
Hopefully that made up for how his stunt put them in the back of the
line.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
accepted, smiling so wonderfully. &quot;Thank you... Do guys do
this?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Uh..&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;And
I'm not into flowers but-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Jeez!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Teasing.&quot;
Luigi gave him a gift too, a bronze little egg thing, riddled with
lines where it had been melded, in turn making it neater looking.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Sweet,
man!&quot; Toad rattled the Bronze Egg around. &quot;...Wait, what
does it hatch into?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Nothing-
Er, I hope. Ha ha.&quot; They laughed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hands
cooly in his pockets, Toad stole a few glances over. This was
asinine, especially how it made him feel. He'd seen him a million
times. This wasn't even his first exposure to the plumber in that
black, well fitted tuxedo. His full head of brown hair was gelled
back and his voluptuous darker brown mustache was trimmed up, just
the perfect contrast against olive skin. The only little issue, it
mostly hid his lips, especially while breathing in that flower. Toad
paid way too much, but it couldn't be that great.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;So
how do you want to swing in? Like with swagger? Or low-key? Or roll a
D12?...Luigi?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Frazzled,
Luigi rose from the plant. &quot;-OH. Sorry I.. had a.. strange
morning. Whatever you're comfortable with-.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Perfect!&quot;
Toad boldly reached for Luigi's full gloveless hand. A spark traveled
up the Earl's arm, to the rest of his nervous system. It was
officially depressing how long he'd been waiting for this. At least
no one was paying attention to them so far back at the map boundary-</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Zhis
is merde!&quot; grumbled a toad host pressing through the crowd.
&quot;Reservations first please! Hey, zhey have one!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Additional
waiters came out and dragged Luigi and Toad in beyond countless
leering toads, tossing them into the moodily lit dining room with
hardwood floors, beige plaster walls, and assorted culinary
knickknacks decorating the wall. A Peddler Toad with a glint in his
eye ambushed, intruding on Mr. Toad in particular.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
sell spare pizza dough. You'll never know when you'll need that
around here!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hardly
having a moment to dust himself off, &quot;No thanks. I think I do
know that I won't need that, homeboy..&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;How
about salt, pepper, lemons?.. To make it zesty!...&quot; He gave up,
hiding his wares. &quot;You don't like zest?.. I KNOW YOU! YOU&quot;RE
FAMOUS-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
zoomed away in a flash. Shortly Luigi tapped gently on the door of
the restroom, Toad dry heaving in there. He thought. A waiter had
their table ready and on cue, Toad reappeared, playing off his
blanched nature. They were led through the dining room, beyond antsy
looking toads, and seated in a red themed partitioned and candle lit
VIP area with a smaller more intimate table.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">When the
menu was placed in Toad's paws, the selection of Italian and grilled
delicacies crowded out much else. His steak request was denied
suspiciously. There was no one to 'defeat' it. Luigi chose the Momma
Mia Pizza and since it was the size of the table, they could share.
As VIPs, a chef came along and 'entertained' by flipping the soft
powdery dough in the air until it arched over and burst out their
window.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The red
faced chef brushed the shattered glass away with his foot.
&quot;Gentlemen, just an itty bitty wait. Dough quantity is low due
to those black market fiends.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">To
complete the cringe package, he left the curtains half open, exposing
them to the other diners with empty plates.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Staring
intensified.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
scooted up closer, ignoring it. &quot;So-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-How
long?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He paused.
&quot;At this rate like an hour...Oh, you mean. Me.&quot; Toad
slapped himself. &quot;It's when you won that mansion. I had the crap
scared out of me man, along with everyone else Peach sent to find
your brother. Still not sure how she thought that would work, but
whatever. What did you mean by that polka dots bit?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;That?&quot;
Luigi shifted, introspectively. &quot;It means what you think! Huh..
that far back?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Eh..
I had issues to sort out. What about you?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
blushed, compulsively arranging and rearranging silverware. He would
have started it out by saying he's 'brutally honest', but merely
thinking the phrase made him shiver eerily. &quot;I won't be
loquacious, not with our 'audience', but I've always thought you were
great and when you asked, I figured.. why not?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;That
casual?&quot; A waiter came around with beverages and courtesy
appetizers. Toad gulped down the fizzy drink, not that he liked those
now, rather his throat was going dry.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;With
you running for mayor in Neo Bowser City, and I doing my thing, would
we have time?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad's
countenance flatted in earnestness. &quot;I'm about to do the most
subversive yet helpful thing I could do as the sort of Toad I am, and
I'm pleading to every star, even the obscure ones for this, Aurelius,
Iris, Adrian (I don't know where I was going with that) but whatever.
I get that angle, but you don't think they want us to be happy,
responsibilities or not?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
reached over the table of small diameter, holding his semi muscled
upper arm. &quot;Yeah I do... In fact that was beautiful.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
are more.&quot; Lost in his blue optimistic eyes, a greedy side took
over. Toad gently reached around the nape of his neck and met the
rest of the way, navigating around Luigi's nose, the mustache, zoning
in on the plumber's lips and pressing against them with his for the
briefest one in a half seconds of his life when-</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
Eldstar- A hoard of toads violently ripped the rest of the curtain
down, crowding their table. &quot;Did we hear something about Bowser
over here? That was the last problematic VIP that closed down the
kitchen. Get them!&quot;</font></p>
<p><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I'm
hungry!&quot; &quot;My butt went to sleep!&quot; &quot;My husband
left me.&quot; &quot;Luigi wouldn't- or WOULD do this!</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;
etc physically battered them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Ugh.
Here's something for all that whine!&quot; Toad threw a giant cheese
wheel at the toads. The heavy thing rolled into the nearby kitchen,
seemingly triggering a cacophony. Cooks escaped, arms in the air. On
instinct, Luigi super jumped over several heads to peep in. Pots and
pans littered the floor, food was dying at the pass or sizzling to
carbon on the stoves, and the freezer was wide open, blasting ice.
Most chillingly however was the sous chef curled up next to the
cutting table, their life drained by a shy guy with a paper straw.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A crinkled
yellow toad creased over a spoke of the ceiling fan, a head chef,
reanimated. &quot;Help!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I'm
sorry alright! I'll never waste cheese again!&quot; Toad materialized
at Luigi's side. &quot;...I caused this, right?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sensing an
extra person, the shy guy bent backwards with an unnatural ninety
degree angle, making eye contact as horror violin chords screeched
from some incorporeal location.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
angled it downwards at the six red eyes in the depths, a sports
program on. &quot;Is this sufficient?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Uh..
Yeah.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">When she
tripped a bit on the chord afterwards, he wanted to reach out and
help her. He certainly could reach with the tendrils, even when
submerged. He hesitated too much and missed his chance. She'd
recovered, and had their outside joint situated, the TV, extension
cords, Ksitigarbha for spiritual motivation, and anyone willing to
hang with a man eating monster. That turned out to be, besides her,
Thomas, and Chef Tim for a reason only he knew.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Conclusively
it wasn't because he liked Mario Strikers games.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-I
thought this was soccer? They're scoring so much it's boring!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Chef,
there are other televisions you can watch,&quot; Toadette droned.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Ms.
Toadette, can I keep these?&quot; Thomas asked all a sudden, holding
a picnic basket that held picked clean white bones.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Eeek!
What's that?!&quot; the chef flipped off of his upside down bucket</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Remember,
he's used to this kinda stuff!&quot; the monster reminded them.
&quot;Forget it Timothy. It's nothing...unlike that birdo player in
the 4 jersey.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Huh?&quot;
Toadette asked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No
not like that.. they're from Donut Plains. I don't know why they keep
tryin to pass them off as Yoshi Islanders. Sound nothing alike.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ah, great
subject change the pink toad thought, especially with the new kid
playing catch.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Sir,
may I ask how you became so proficient?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I've
met a lot of different people kid, at the orphanage and on adventures
now.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Sorry,
sir.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Don't
be. Tim should be sorry he didn't drop any snacks in that wipeout
though..&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Huffing,
the orange toad got up, as peevishly as his mother Zess T. &quot;Fine,
back to that empty shell of a castle. Here's something for you, by
the way.&quot; He passed along the other half of the document from
Hotel Mario, Toadette jolting as she accepted.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;How
long were you sitting on this Tim??&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Is
that a fat joke?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;What-
no! I meant-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Kidding!..
You were so engrossed in that sports game.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Exasperatedly,
she checked it out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
know I had to sneak into Zeror's room while he was showering for
that. He could check that rash... Anyway, yes that is dangerous, just
like other articles I was told to burn on my first day. Samuel showed
which from the basement archives. That's why I sabotaged Zeror, Joe,
and Les with the dessert.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
covered her mouth. &quot;Stars in heaven..&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Miss
Toadette, are you okay?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She turned
to Thomas, nodding. &quot;We should analyze this indoors. Blue, need
anything?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yeah.
Phone.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Without
questioning, she placed a cordless one at the water's edge. Once they
were gone, a thin tendril surfaced and called long distance to Ricco
Harbor, fulfilling that check-in he never got a chance to last night.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hey,
Brah. It's high tide and people are everywhere, swarming. Can hardly
breathe. Gotta go-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
monster quickly stood from the lake, revealing semi-translucent skin,
two tree trunk sized legs and giant swooper-like wings on his back.
From his armless sides sprouted the innumerable tendrils, stretched
out in surprise. &quot;Ala-Gold.. You're okay?!&quot;</font></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Better
than okay, brah. I&rsquo;m home.&rdquo;</font></em> 
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bucken-Berry
leapt on land, stomping around out in the open, not caring. &ldquo;So
you reanimate at home, or however you're alive again and don't tell
me?!? I loved you dude. I&rsquo;m sorry I treated you like crap
sometimes!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yes
dude!!! God, I'm so messed up inside.. I&rsquo;ll stay on the meds
this time and- stop blaming other people for everything. I don&rsquo;t
even have beef with Mr. Toad anymore like you and Toadette hated.
Just come back. I'll never hurt you again, I promise.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Only
now?? Too late to salvage, brah!&rdquo; his friend jabbed. &ldquo;Think
Toad or Toadette or Thomas can shield you now that you&rsquo;re that
freak? Just give u- I mean, join </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">me</font></em>
<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">here.&rdquo;
The tension in the golden toad&rsquo;s deep voice eased. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d
be safe from uh, those tanks and banzai bills, Cool Blue.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bucken-Berry&rsquo;s
gargantuan strides lead him to Star Hill, the pelt of stray star bits
on his scales waking him up with one three toed foot hanging off the
gorge, a bottomless pit in the center of the mountain. He hurled
himself backward, smashing trees.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Still
there, brah?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
floodgates opened, the monster&rsquo;s eyes opening. &ldquo;Yeah..
I&rsquo;ll stay here. Where you're at doesn&rsquo;t sound fun. You
know I need space.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Cool
Blue-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-And
you ALWAYS refused to call me that! I don&rsquo;t think you know me
anymore.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...I
should have never shielded you,&rdquo; he hissed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bucken-Berry
felt the spines flare again. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t. Ala-Gold did.
WHO ARE YOU, PUNK!?!&rdquo; bellowed across the entire kingdom.
Lowering the phone, the left head noticed they&rsquo;d death-breathed
it into melted plastic. Darn. That was castle property&hellip;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
ceiling fan chef cried, &ldquo;Unlock that cabinet!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
barged forward, rolling under the fire billowing from the ovens. His
klutzy skull bash undid the latch and from out of it split another
shy guy with a white hat, the Tangerino Grill&rsquo;s secret weapon.
Luigi used the cane to hook Toad away as the Slurp Guy&rsquo;s straw
punctured the attacker and drained his paint. Shunned Guy twisted
around at an abnormal angle, latching on the Slurp Guy to drain them
back.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
an infinite paint exchange cycle over there, an ouroboros..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oww..
Phrasing.. I mean thanks.&rdquo; Woozily, trying to grab both the
plumber and the wall to stand, Toad flipped a wall switch, speeding
up the fan.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
caught the chef, both going down and tipping hot pans. Toad caught
them in turn, only forgetting the fireball jetting across the
kitchen. Melting out the freezer, a steam cloud and wave of ice water
swept them out! While the paper characters panicked, the snazzy duo
collided against the dessert display, layer cakes and someone&rsquo;s
abandoned to-go order flipping into their laps. Luigi couldn't
believe how absurd this Paper Mario entry was. Why wasn&rsquo;t he in
it? Or was he?</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">During
that crisis, Toad patted his shoulder, idly munching on the sweets
like a starved barbarian with the other hand. It was like gravel down
his throat, and the cheese curls flavorless, lacking&hellip; zest.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Blessings
unto you gentlemen.&rdquo; Someone disturbed a puddle next to Toad.
&ldquo;Looks like this is a destination the brigade can skip,&rdquo;
chattered a yellow toad, not of the staff here, in adventurer&rsquo;s
garb with tan thick pants and hiking boots. Lifting from his crumb
filled suit to J&ouml;rg, Mr. Toad&rsquo;s eyes widened. He screamed.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They came
to facing upwards, tied and bound to the roof of a station wagon
kart. It sped treacherously and weaving around palm trees on the
coastal edge of Water Land with a siren blasting police kart close
behind. They were dressed like at the outing, but the time was
ambiguous, Toad&rsquo;s watch irretrievable and the sky purple and
hazy, no sun visible as smoggy as it felt.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
squeezed his eyes shut. &ldquo;I knew I&rsquo;d obtained a head
injury at some point..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Cool as
the other side of the pillow, Toad used his free enough hand to stab
through the roof beneath them with a blade, prying it open like a
can. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t a dream. Stan will wish it was&hellip;&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
turned to him and back, eyebrows knotting. &ldquo;Knowing your sense
of humor, were you carrying a straight blade everywhere to be
ironic?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad eyed
him endearingly. &ldquo;Uh, no. You were less PC than me for once,
niiiice!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He lay
flat again, back of his head bopping against the metal. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
definitely brain damaged.&rdquo;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">An intense
rivalry span across every kingdom and the Great Sea, where at last,
at near inhabitable Inception Island of Fahr Outpost, the camo-clad
thirty-fiveish aged noki was worn down by the fortyish something red
boo and cornered against a frigid solid rock. In all of the
detective's fifteen or twenty, depending on which he was going with
that day, years of experience, he'd never had a target as dangerous
and persistent as Agent M, lowering the rocket launcher to smirk and
display all those sharp cascading teeth.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;We
both fabricate our age, how cute!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jelectro
tilted his sunglasses to wink. &quot;At least I don't have to, Patchy
McGraybeard.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hey!
Heeeey&hellip;&quot; M rubbed his chin. &quot;I'm doing my best and
chicks dig it. Now you and Jeremy are still in the condo at so and
so..? How many pieces you wanna be mailed back in?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The red
boo aimed the launcher again, cackling like a maniac. A mound of snow
had accumulated on the barrel that quick. If the 'friendly' chat went
on, Jelectro would soon be buried alive anyway. Of the rogue gallery,
he found himself longing for on and off hours friend 999, or Lt.
Stone. If not spike deep in Koopa Troop espionage, he could have been
around, salving the unhinged as was his unusual knack. 0064 supposed
he could use his own powers and it wouldn't be hedonistic for once,
but evidently M was only thinking about home at Toad Town and being
with some girlfriend..</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
are despicable, Trevor!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;That's
what my old therapist said! You know he prescribed me a rope, Bond?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The noki
mumbled some reply, trained now at something down the dark barrel,
the size of his head. There was an object stuffed in, and not a
bullet bill-</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-I
know! What a quack. Chains are far better, you know, for gagging
people. You'd be able to testify! Fine, FINE enough stalling-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And then,
the noki reached and latched onto the object, creating a backfire
that blew the red boo off the cliff. The snowball containing him
smacked against a cabin, sending its occupant, a bob-omb in a fur hat
out to investigate. Agent M emerged before the spherical baddie, the
remains of his rocket launcher in the lawn split like a banana. He
decked the civilian and retrieved his backup, the SS HQ shotty,
approaching the cracked up dark blue shell of a noki, surrounded by
colorful fun confetti.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He froze
for a bit, literally as well, an ill feeling building up until he was
gently prodded.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Mon
ami, I thought it was time to come out of my shell.&quot; Jelectro,
runny nosed and in an undershirt, loaded the silenced handgun. &quot;Last
words?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Agent M's
lip curled. &quot;Yeah-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No
no-&quot; He revealed the red boo's own cell phone he'd pilfered. &quot;To
your Mademoiselle-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">M scanned
the text and cursed to himself. &quot;I promised Bridget I was gonna
be home every night from now on&hellip;&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The noki
checked his dive watch, the dunce cap then on him. Unless he'd reset
the calendar under the cyclops by accident, it was Sunday morning.
&quot;Aye aye aye. We can kill each other another day. Oui?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The two
scaled down in the six feet of slush, ice beating down.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;If
you say so,&quot; Agent M breathed down his neck.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;That
was unnecessary.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;It
wasn't. You know this whole thing was me trying to frame the Spy Guy
alliance.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jelectro
made him trip on purpose. &quot;What part of me going down a canyon
in your rust bucket would accomplish that, mon ami??&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;The
part where I would phase you out and fake your assassination? It was
that koopaling that mucked it up Either way, this fiasco is off the
books. Us boo buddies aren't terrible secret keepers like the boo
diddlys... Hey Jelectro!&quot; He scowled as the noki jumped on a
rickety ski lift in the middle of his sentence. M leapt for the
sidebar, dangled for a moment to catch his breath and then sloppily
spilled onto the chairlift. &quot;Don't even try to ditch me, Bond.
People that turn their back to boos never make it long..&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Rules
and conventions are nothing to me or you. Are not Red Boos an all
female species?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hey!
&hellip;Heeey.. Just for that you're paying the tab into town!
Clear?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jelectro
focused ahead only, fighting against the nosebleed coming on.. &ldquo;Wrong
again, Trevor. Everything is </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">opaque</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">.&rdquo;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Around the
fortress in Neo Bowser City, agitated volcanoes spew lava all around
town, mesmerizing a toad girl in the window, pressed to the glass
drapes fully drawn. Mayor Koton and his rock baddies gave her and the
gang the conference room, the lounge chair, the computer, and an
awesome snack machine.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Emery.
Uh. Emery?&quot; A koopatrol in a pink dress suit and tie, the men's
uniform companion the girl's suit of a more feminine cut, stood next
to her. &quot;That kind of thing isn't healthy for even us natives..&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Startled,
she bumped into him, righted herself, and flashed an ok, smoke
pouring from her eye sockets. &quot;Noted.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Guess
this is a bad time to discuss Queen Wendy O's official statement?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No,
go ahead.&quot; She smiled, trying to not look blind.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Tanner
fiddled with his pockets. &quot;She'd texted me it. And then my phone
died forever.&quot; Looking over the old Bowserphone with a Koopa
Ball Z shell cover was bittersweet. Its abrupt end flushed down a
couple of old pictures he had of Zoo.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Well?&quot;
She poked his hard chest.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh.
Umm, the basics are: if anyone doesn't want to support her 'fabulous
dreams', reshaping the world, killing plumbers, being good looking,
blah blah, expect death.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;How
could anyone say no to that?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
know. She sounded like her old self in it too, and to be messaged
directly, I must be doin' great!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
can't see that.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Deflating,
&quot;-Yeah, I'm just a door and pizza box guard..&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No I
mean-&quot; She held his elbow, she hoped, and led him toward what
she was hearing . On the surveillance screens showing downstairs,
Skylandians were gathering on the Dark Land crest rug, darker skinned
toads with mostly light blue spots. Decorated in armor from
yesterday's battle, and running on that same high by their boldness
in speaking to Johnson, they were all going to march down tomorrow to
vote for Toad!</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Guys
guys guys! Something crazy just happened!&quot; Hippity Hop announced
in the doorway after the fact. They shrieked regardless.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Emery
found the worn, hand me down desk and sat. Funny, she despised being
propped behind these when at MK East, dealing with paperwork or some
drivel. Now she was willing because she saw the big picture. -Once
the black dots faded from her vision she would rather. She called up
Wendy on the conference phone. The distaff koopaling appeared on
screen. She had an influencer angle, so she wasn't too close, showing
others in the background looking gaunt and tired. As for the
princess, she positively glowed, like she'd spent the night in a
fancy hotel, exactly like her glamor shots, infatuating the three
until her low venous tone shot them back to reality.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I am
aware of encroaching dangers, disciples Emery, Tanner.. And
Flippity-Flop.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A Fighter
Fly escaped the open suitcase, all that was in it. The green dinosaur
wished to the stars for a reset and he got it, already having a
banality free for once phone conversation with his ex-fianc&eacute;
for closure. She&rsquo;d tied a balloon to her problems and released
the string, per her &lsquo;elegant&rsquo; quote. The Marios could use
that advice, his short tail managing to whack into everything during
his respite stay. Ripping Poochy away from cartoons caused an
avalanche from boxes near the TV.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario shot
up from the kitchen table, leaving behind the toaster he was
repairing. &ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d shoved those Nintendo console
boxes in the closet..&rdquo; While assisting he discovered a music
box he lost a year ago, dropping the dino all over again in his
haste.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A lump on
his nose, Yoshi rescued himself ultimately. A broken up statue in the
pile stood out. &ldquo;This is why that happens, Mario!&rdquo; he
lectured heatedly. A self deprecating smile almost crept on him,
recalling the rafter in the eye parable. &ldquo;Sorry.. What was
that? Maybe we can replace it,&rdquo; he offered.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
downtrodden plumber let some of the blue parts spill from his arms in
defeat. &ldquo;Doubt that, Yosh. It&rsquo;s Bowser&rsquo;s brother.&rdquo;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After an
enduring light speed journey through disorienting pewter colored
space dust, it was only at the impenetrable gold gates where
Millennium Star grumbled. The white fields of Eldstar&rsquo;s court
were scorched, sporadically unveiling the bare sapphire platform, and
the aqueduct of the perpetual motion machine was desertic. The
ancient star&rsquo;s omniscience allowed him a window inside the
tarnished temple:</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~Mamar and
Kalmar chat on a rear balcony, empty pie pans stacked two and three
high. Muskular was in his ground floor gym, a pan on a bench while he
lifted a dumbbell. Misstar sat at a vanity, adjusting her sun colored
silk ribbon, a partially consumed pie also reflecting along with her
stunning self. Kevlar and Skolar, distanced by rows of shelves in the
library, identically had their workspace soiled by crumbs. Eldstar
was in the hall adjacent to his room, like he&rsquo;d only made it
that far before he had to stop and tap on his pager, the flakes on
his mustache and a berry colored smudge on the side of his mouth
revealing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Millennium
Star rattled the gate. &ldquo;Absurd!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Exactly!&rdquo;
From out of the fog emerged a miniature golden star. He bowed,
explaining through his strained breaths. &ldquo;The Mario Kart
results soured my appetite, so I passed when the Absurd Apple Pies
were sent.&rdquo; Twink hovered again, his natural glow framing a
face etched with agony. &ldquo;It broke something in the Star
Spirits. They&rsquo;ve been dithering since. I saw the deliverer
but-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ho
ho, splendid!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Uh,
I.. was actually told by the star kids I was fussing over a
coincidence.&rdquo; Twink glanced off into the cosmos emptily. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
scattered since.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Millennium
Star took his pointed arm, raising him to his level. &ldquo;Shame on
those insolents. They will be forgotten in the annals of this journey
unlike you. Steer me to the assailant!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The cosmic
clouds almost parted for the ancient star sweeping Rosalina&rsquo;s
Comet Observatory until he found the idyllic zone abandoned. The
console display was powered down, uncharacteristic of the watchful
goddess, and there was but one luma visible, waving him down.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Help!&rdquo;
A dark brown star begged, flat on the floor. &ldquo;I tried to warn
that star warrior against &lsquo;rolling up gangsta style&rsquo; on
Earth. He seized Rosalina as well, Milly. Knock some sense into him!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Coming
down, his eyebrows furrowed. &ldquo;..What did you just call me?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Polari
peeled himself up. &ldquo;-Excuse me, Millennium Star I'm so
overwrought- Oh hurry please. </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I</font></em>
<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">will become a
launch star for you.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Why
thank you..&rdquo; Millennium Star mumbled, watching Polari spin on
the spot and transform into a black colored version of that
distinctive form of star powered transportation. A sense tingled as
he stopped outside it, examining and in fact about to decline, when a
particlized tendril captured and dragged him in with crushing
gravity. He grit his teeth, the outer ring spinning rapidly
counterclockwise around him.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That&rsquo;s
what ya get for pokin &lsquo;round, Milly!&rdquo; roared the launch
star.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
was always a curious bugger, Zachary A. Star!&rdquo; he spat back.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A nerve
hit, the adversary spewed him through the universe so quickly the
fabrics of it warbled. Not concerning much to Millennium Star, the
lord of two things, one of which the Dark Ztar was running out of.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">If Mario
got away with pretending small refreshes made something original, he
could too. Without fortresses, bloodwood trees, banners, and other
works cluttering 444 Dark Drive, fresh angles were unveiled on the
swampy Badlands, the flat traditional Darklandian village, scaling
modern Neo Bowser City, and the distant rural volcano range. It could
be more appreciated if they weren&rsquo;t drained from travel and
stuck under leaking flimsy tents. Something had to be done, Bowser
recognized, if he didn&rsquo;t want to lose the tiny bit of morale
he&rsquo;d scraped up, calling for a different type of wizardry. He
was going to put on his best behavior and delegate. (Unlike those
&lsquo;lazy&rsquo; Mushroomites who got everything handed to them,
grrr.)</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Hello
caller,&rdquo; the company picked up, &ldquo;Did you hit the 1 or the
3?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...Hello?
Yeah, this is Bowser!!&rdquo; he blew the speaker out, covering his
mouth afterward. &ldquo;None.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">..</font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So
it defaults to three. Noted,</font></em>&rdquo; <font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It
was a gravelly Mushroom accented voice. &ldquo; &hellip;.Thank you
for calling 'Authentic Restorations and Replicas Inc.&rsquo; This is
Mr. X speaking and, unfortunately, how may I help you?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Who asked
for that sass? Bowser held his rebuttal. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve returned
to Dark Land and I would like to order a copy of my castle. Don&rsquo;t
worry, I won&rsquo;t illegally rip off the REPLICA stickers.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Your
slaves can&rsquo;t build for you?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No,
LOSER- Erm. My point is if I hired minions to do it, which means I
pay extra by the way, it&rsquo;s just as much my goal to keep the few
folks willing to support me from getting hypothermia!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">..I&rsquo;m
sorry I wasn&rsquo;t keeping up. When did that change?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Like..
I dunno.&rdquo; Bowser checked around the alleyways of the camp,
cupping over the speaker. &ldquo;Years back. Yeah. Not too long
after.. My marriage end. Is that even your business? What, need a
background check? I have the money. You in or out??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sure,
sure. Send to here..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">While
using a dry tree stump to write on, Bowser found it quaint that
someone was that out of touch with the biggest menace in the Mushroom
World. X really didn&rsquo;t get out. Shortly he had the checks
filled, his large handwriting requiring multiple to hold the zeros.
Runner minions came up, including a paragoomba in a pink officer's
cap. After having the check containing the important decimal point
slapped in his face, he shook it off.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">This
is Hippity Hop sir, 13th aerial forces. I think Queen Wendy O. wanted
me to escort her into the city.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Bowser
parted through the Koopa Troop until he brought his only daughter to
the front by the shell. &ldquo;You are grounded and you CANNOT go
downtown with all the malls until that election tomorrow. I&rsquo;m
sick of this craziness. Know what? I don&rsquo;t want ANYONE by
Hippityface going back right now..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
pouted. &ldquo;Daddy...&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Enough!
Who volunteers to guard the path so nobody sneaks off???&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Like he&rsquo;d
proposed a raise, there were goombas, bob-ombs, shy guys, heck even
Morton rallying until Ludwig tapped him. A drone of unaffiliated
airships filled the turbulent skies.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Four
carried over the KT camp a huge structure, releasing the cables over
the castle plot. Bowser and others unearthed from the tidal wave of
mud, blindly crawling in the direction of impact. Only when Kammy
bumped Kamek into the moat did it click for the less sophomoric.
Compact, boxy, non-self indulgent and with relatively low towers, it
featured a parasitic fortress that was once Larry&rsquo;s, and a neon
board screaming BOWSER that was in fashion during the Dinosaur Land
takeover era.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Consequently
the Koopa King dragged his feet across the drawbridge, the others
overtaking him to disperse happily. After some used that BACK DOOR
however, he recalled that this was Mario&rsquo;s favorite design in
the day. He was just so dang athletic if he wanted to be...</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Settle
down, your viciousness. You seem smitten. Should I call a medic?&rdquo;
A crone blocked his path.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
soot-covered magikoopa shoved her aside. &ldquo;Lord Bowser would
rather not when we already owe this.&rdquo; Kamek handed the
flustered Koopa King the MKDCU bill.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">WHAT???&rdquo;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daisy,
I&rsquo;m delighted you&rsquo;re delighted of the progress so far!.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Didn't
mean to holla. Sorry.&rdquo; Daisy squeezed her tight under the
arched lattice entrance into the newly renovated garden. The blonde
princess ignored how crumpled her fancier more exaggerated dress was
getting. She also had ringlets in her hair, new opera gloves and pink
shined heels. As long as Daisy didn&rsquo;t mess any of that up,
she&rsquo;d be able to shape herself back up for later.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daisy
scoped Joseph's maze, hands on hips. &ldquo;Wow.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There&rsquo;s
a developer's exit to skip-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Where&rsquo;s
the fun in that? Come on.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The tanned
princess led her, hand in hand, through the leafy zig zags, at one
point passing right by the gardener without recognition. As they
hadn't gotten together in a while, Peach remembered how much she
admired Daisy's super power. In addition to how she attracted
Flutters, made buds on potted plants open, withered hedges flower,
and the parched ground green, she could amble with messy shoulder
length hair, an orange hoodie, blue track pants, and tennis shoes and
be treated 'normally'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Spray from
the waterfall released Peach from that tangent. They'd reached the
clearing at the end, a tranquil spring setting yards from the river.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;How'd
I do without a map?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;..Wonderful,
dear!&quot; Peach worked through her off kilter feeling to show her
to the metal table and chairs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A steward
materialized on the spot, sliding the chairs out and setting the
table expertly in five seconds, with tea in cups. Everything was
easing back into what Peach envisioned for this 'business meeting',
until the auburn haired princess leaned way back in the 19th century
bedizened chair like it was some ratty old recliner, her long bronze
legs stretching beyond where Peach's were. Peach glanced to Toadette
and back, flushing, and said nothing, trying not to stare. Thusly the
toad girl persisted with the 'script'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She pulled
out a violin and a bow, screeching one note before Peach stopped her.
&quot;Wrong mood we're going for, dear. It's a tea party with Daisy,
not..&quot; She whispered, &quot;When Mario and I would do this!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
sheepishly lowered the vintage instrument. &quot;Princess, your CD
with the ambient bird sounds is misplaced.&quot;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><b>I
know where to find another!!</b></font>&rdquo; <font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
gigantic three-headed monster sprung out of the joining lake.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">While the
blonde princess hid behind a paper fan, Daisy shielded the sun, eager
to see the kaiju sweep around Toad Town with his bat wings, cries of
confusion or terror resonating out there. &quot;That's wicked!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
stared off dreamily. &quot;Blue has really glowed up. I love the
confidence, the fire breath, how he wears a size 500 shoe &hellip;Enjoy
the tea!&quot; She inched away from that TMI admission, replaced with
a taller heavyset purple toad.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Les
chatted up Daisy. Unfortunately for her or him, it was enigmatic to
Peach either way, she knew the discography of the band on her shirt
better than he did, as she was more into 'metal' and he into 'rock'.
Joseph swung in, dropping some fire and ice flowers on their table as
his excuse to intrude. That didn't last however, Daisy not knowing
ASL. As more toads spontaneously realized that another princess was
on their property, Chef Tim informed them of cupcakes in the oven,
though he blabbed so long he suddenly had to sprint away to put out a
small fire. A shy kid, Thomas came up with the CD over his finger,
but no player to use it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;We're
going to have to proceed without some accommodations, I'm afraid.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daisy
shrugged and laughed in response. &quot;Great. It's sorta awkward to
go all out when this is nothing.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
abruptly sat down her emptied tiny ceramic cup. &quot;This was an act
of war against your kingdom too!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Nah.&quot;
She patted the pink princess's poofy sleeves. &quot;I bet they didn't
even know who I was in all this mess. I'm fine, and if I get home
before tomorrow I won't get chewed tf out.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh.&quot;
Peach didn't know how to react, especially when Daisy sat straight,
somewhat serious faced.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Peach,
besides restitution, what else do you want to talk about?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Unable to
look into the other princess's deep blue eyes, she pretended the
waterfall she'd seen all her life was exceptionally interesting right
then. &quot;My father will have some very valid matters to question
me on today. I can't keep peace. I keep needing assistance. I'm not
engaged yet! It makes the way I took over haunt me again, because
after all that, I'm still failing.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daisy's
hands covered over her wrists as she wavered. &quot;Straight up. I
know your story and all that, so was sending him out of town the
right choice?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
gathered the courage to face her. &quot;Yes.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She handed
over a red and white checkered keffiyeh she'd packed. &quot;K. Put
that on. It's important. Now road trip!!!!!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
found herself basking in the sights, smells, and sensations of
typical life, no agents of her father ruining it with tanks. The
strict classes she grew up with were vanquished, toads, koopas, other
'friendly' and 'enemy' species alike bustling around Toad Town.
Together, without a steward or guide, they could do whatever. They
window shopped, visited important landmarks like the coliseum, busy
with helping Mushroom Flu patients in the wide space, and tried out
questionable or odd items sold on the street, like a 'never-melt'
snow bunny that did just that all over the place. During the last
fifteen minutes of 'BUZZY: The Movie' at the one coin theater, they
were asked to leave, because Daisy kept sharing far more entertaining
memes on her phone. An attendant caught Peach's identity once in the
lobby and prostrated, but she let the decision stand. This was all so
unprincess like, yet invigorating, even when they almost died on the
way back to the castle.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Okay a
truck- almost- by accident surely, splashed them from a puddle, but
still! No hysterics. No one hurled their body in the way to block it,
nothing. It was as clear as the lake in the center of Royal Raceway
that she needed to fix her perspective.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;So
we learned...&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
didn't answer quickly enough she supposed, Daisy shaking her
playfully. &quot;In a theater, don't operate-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Besides
that!&quot; she laughed. &quot;You've done more than any Toadstool
ever, girl. That's what. They feel safe here, dedicate their lives to
it, fight for it.. The King had better be proud!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A tear
she'd been holding in rolled. &quot;Yes. He should.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daisy
handed her something. After accepting, she realized it was a
sweatband. &quot;Umm.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;It's
clean! Now lemme teach ya about going nuclear.&quot; She sat on the
concrete barrier.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Though the
flawless condition of her dress flashed in Peach's mind, whatever the
Sarasalandian had to say somehow became more tantalizing, and she
joined her. &quot;What does that entail?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Remember
when nothing was going on for a while? Back home artifacts were
making pyramids fly, possessing folks, causing plagues-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach was
inadvertently squeezing the tan princess's freckled forearm.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
know. I excavated bout fifty plots, including my own backyard, and
the catch was to gather them up. With the conflict, we could blow the
suckers sky high. So it's literal.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;...Is
it that simple? Thank you, by the way.&quot; She awkwardly returned
the sweatband.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No
prob, and yep, it is. Thanks for listening to my Ted Talk.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;What?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yeah,
nothin..&quot; Daisy stared intensely, leaning in. &quot;Peach, I
dunno if it's your perfect race track backdrop, the waters
reflectin', or the darker colors of your dress, but your eyes are SO
effin blue right now. Like more than the beautiful Great Sea.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The blonde
princess blushed. If.. if only she wasn't complementing contacts.
&quot;I'm not used to head coverings. Yes.. and I'm a little dizzy.
Let's get out of the heat,&quot; she sputtered, climbing up.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daisy
rose, visibly disappointed. &quot;Not stopping those racers. Just
sayin'.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A silver
Aston Mushroom drifted around the curve leading to the starting line,
braking aggressively in front of them. The window lowered. &ldquo;Princess!
Yoohoo! Could I ask a few things?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
Koopa, famed reporter, jumped out. The way her pen hovered over the
notepad made Peach&rsquo;s stomach twirl- or in a bad way now rather.
Her first instinct was to skip out of there until a poke in her back
made her leap forward almost into her.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
got this!&rdquo; Daisy winked, moving off to blend in with some road
workers in the background.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
fired questions, basic ones the princess always got post rescue. The
only new detail was that &lsquo;toad destroyer&rsquo; Boo was
arrested. Lo and behold, her friend called it. Nothing to be afraid
of. Kylie finished jotting and, like something pinged her, glanced
over her shell and back.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">One
sec.&rdquo; Kylie hopped in, started that kart and made a U-turn so
that the passenger side was stationed at Peach.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She gasped
as it rolled down and a toad she had a long history with flashed a
white smile.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;m
a quarter mile from your castle, so this is permissible right? Got
one question..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
struggled to not eyeroll. He was banned from her home, not
specifically from herself, quite and oversight to realize now. The
green toad had crinkles and since last seeing him, but with that
strong deep voice for a toad and decent male fashion sense, it was
undeniably Mitch Toad. &ldquo;You may proceed.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
leaned into view. &ldquo;I might be recording this too. Just for
backup.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Stuff
it..&rdquo; Mitch shoved her face out of the way. &quot;A suitor, the
richest guy in town is interested in ya, and he&rsquo;s the one that
rebuilt your castle!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Interview
over-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mitch
flipped his notebook like some luxurious game show prize, pink
official parchment with a perfect forgery of 'THE KING'. &ldquo;-And
he&rsquo;s right here! ...Oh you think you're safe because I can't
hop out? That doesn't stop me anymore&rdquo; With a loud crack, the
raised dash panel section of her raceway crumbled, terrifying nearby
workers. &ldquo;Now eyes back to me. As king I'd show the cretins
round here what fair society looks like, unlike-&rdquo; He covered
his mouth scandalously. &ldquo;</font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
contents of that parcel you&rsquo;re hiding.</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">.
&rsquo;ve already predicted every move of yours. Give it up. Marry
me.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-You
got some nerve talking smack to her.&rdquo; Daisy popped up,
snatching the toad by the necktie.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Then a
door was kicked shut by the irate pink shelled koopa storming out.
&quot;If you're trying to gather a harem, forget about helping me
with this Nass T. case!&quot;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Whatever,&rdquo;
he snorted to her. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know &lsquo;Peachy&rsquo;
as much as ya think, Daisy. How&rsquo;s she gonna explain who rebuilt
the caste? Why she&rsquo;s wearing colored contacts? Why she won&rsquo;t
be engaged when she&rsquo;s embellished to her dad she was?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daisy
stepped back from the sports car, unreadably. &ldquo;No lies told,
dawg!&rdquo; She drew closer to Peach. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s&hellip;
with me.&rdquo; Slapping Peach&rsquo;s behind with apparently an
authentic enough reaction in return, applause and whistling erupted
out of nowhere.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Color
draining, Peach whipped left and right. Pianta, monty, and toads in
hardhats lined the sides, Kylie, not quite out of ear range spinning
on her heels, gawking.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A taped
recipe slid from under Chancellor Samuel Toadsworth&rsquo;s red door,
bunching against Toadette&rsquo;s shoe. He&rsquo;d scrutinized it at
least she hoped, he tried to destroy it decades ago after all,
because as dutiful as she was, smothering himself in that room was
derisive at his point. Before she went ham, she saw words on the
other side, his written reply. That wasn&rsquo;t the etiquette for..
She&rsquo;d reluctantly accept that for now, running late. She darted
downstairs, beyond Mr. Zeror digging in a supply closet, and took
some keys off a hook. She got to drive a car unattended, brightening
her mood considerably. See, flooding the Birthday Kart like a klutz
sent it to a shop, and in an ironic way now, what was one of Peach&rsquo;s
newest assets pre-castle destruction now fit in better with the
surviving relics sealed in the basement. She rolled it out into the
driveway-</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette!&rdquo;
The frenzied princess clung to the side of the kart, scaring the
daylights out of her. &ldquo;We must stop the presses, the message
boards, and the gossip of the Toad Town public transportation. -Or,&rdquo;
Peach beamed, like she had the most brilliant idea then. &ldquo;I
need an invention that reverses time!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daisy
rested her foot on the bumper, less traumatized but breathing as
heavily from the mad dash. &ldquo;Maybe I can work on that last one.
I see the sunscreen, the sunglasses. Head&rsquo;n down South?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
nodded, dumbstruck.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Good.
Btw Peachy and I are engaged until then.&rdquo;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It
ain&rsquo;t working out,&rdquo; Roy wagged fingers in the face of the
Koopa Troop general gazing endlessly into the overcast. &ldquo;Face
it, Luddy. She&rsquo;s just not dat into yer meetings.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A thorough
sweep of the graveyard of upturned and nonairworthy airships behind
Bowser&rsquo;s New Castle did not unveil Wendy or Larry, mirroring
the previous meeting. &ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; Ludwig grunted, settling on
what crowd he did have, a dozen assorted baddies, not counting
siblings.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">All
attention on him, woozy with a thick scarf he&rsquo;d never be caught
in normally hiding &lsquo;influenza&rsquo; sores, in reality an
unsubstantiated side effect from the Gravitational Pull, he shattered
on the spot, his knees buckling.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-IT&rsquo;S
NOT FINE!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A rainbow
haired koopaling detached from the others who had never seen that
part of their commander before, followed by a taller one with a green
half shave.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After
we acquire the Special Object, how can we keep it safe?? I cannot
believe I am doubting myself,&rdquo; he wept onto Lemmy as he patted
his shell comfortingly. Iggy's arms were out stretched and he totally
didn't go for him. He knew Lemmy was the Bish&#333;nen between them,
but what the heck..</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We&rsquo;re
this close despite all that, though! Now we can ALL fight the dark
star! We don&rsquo;t even care that we can die!... Welp, I
coulda..reworded that...&rdquo; Lemmy watched Davey the whomp, Claude
the albatoss, Annabell the pom pom, and other minions whose names
only he knew scurry.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After a
grateful nod of acknowledgement to his &lsquo;trusted adjutant&rsquo;,
oh and that other one, Ludwig obtained his equilibrium. &ldquo;You
are correct. I should appreciate what I have.&rdquo; He squinted at
the bony beetle doubling back.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sup,&rdquo;
Leo greeted. &ldquo;My cousin just texted me that Miss Wendy uh..
Left Bowser&rsquo;s New Castle on an errand, clack clack.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">But
it is integral that we monitor her!!!&rdquo; Ludwig demanded. &ldquo;The
Jewel of the Stars, WW63 relic is somewhere in Mayor Koton&rsquo;s
office. &lsquo;Parallelogon&rsquo; belongs outside her clutches.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ooh!
I can track her with my &lsquo;Way Awesome Intelligent Futuristic
Utility&rsquo;!!&rdquo; Iggy Delta bounced around, waving for
attention. &quot;Lemmy, would you like for me to show you my super
cool abilities?&quot;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;d
like it but..&rdquo; Lemmy struggled for a second,
uncharacteristically.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He&rsquo;ll
wuss out anyway! Bawk bawk bawk!&rdquo; Roy sneered, overdoing it
blatantly to Ludwig. He was apprehensive himself!</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Knock
it off! I&rsquo;m Super Mercenary Iggy Delta now, cybernetically
enhanced koopaling soon to get at least a two season anime and a
finale episode! Or a manga volume, I&rsquo;d take that too if any
publishers are listening-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
must vouch for Iggster.&rdquo; Morton was given a bizarre once over
from Roy but he continued, from the safety of standing behind Ludwig.
&ldquo;My bookclub is raving about his tech services saying he did
not budge, capitulate, or back down when they wanted a discount.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Junior
paused his playing with a toy train. &ldquo;Can I get an opinion?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Nope,&rdquo;
they unanimously answered..</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
rubbed his chin. He observed how Neo Bowser City had a bright halo,
befitting of how it was his salvation. The end of this was nigh
assuming Toadsworth, kingdoms away pulled his weight. The next page
for him? Likely sending postcards to his friends- no scratch that,
his family only from the Overthere.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
shall go Ignatius,&rdquo; he decided, just in time for the dinner
call. Roy made a dangerous &lsquo;I see you&rsquo; gesture to Morton,
Junior was still ignored and Iggy was the last remaining outdoors,
despondently soaking in the rain&hellip;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;How
wonderful for you sartorially immaculate gentlemen to drop in!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The roof
folded under the weight of their hostages and dumped them in the
middle row, The Captain amused while Banktoad, also in the front,
sunk out of view from embarrassment.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The blue
geeky toad secured a sleeve of the stylish plumber. &quot;Did you
know the average toad has 2.5 times the strength of a human?-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
swung his leg up and kicked Hint Toad across that cheeky face. &quot;No
average human here, bucko.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
unconscious spectacled adventurer slumped into the lap of Mailtoad.
He jut his arms up in surrender, as Toad already had a blade to his
neck.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Stop
this thing, or paperboy gets it!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Captain
tapped the wheel, thinking it over with no urgency, oblivious to
Mailtoad pleading for his life.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Banktoad
had enough. &quot;Here! Take this in exchange!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
clumsily caught the tossed backward Vrlrdyi Scope.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;William!&quot;
The Captain pinched his nephew's ear and they fought in the front row
like animals, the serving, tilting vehicle jumbling Toad and Luigi
around without seatbelts.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Like a lit
bob-omb went off, &quot;I HATE YOU STANLEY YOU STUPID BISH! STOP
MAKING EVERYTHING HELL FOR US AND STOP THE CAR! !!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Captain
Toad mashed the brakes, sand flying, before they careened into the
ocean. Luigi and Toad smacked against the back of their seat and
bounced off, dazed. &quot;William, watch your language,&quot; he
hissed, fingers quivering over the wheel. &quot;I regret ever
approaching you while you were down, bestowing an irregular a
lucrative career and- How did this wonderous bridge get here?&quot;
He pointed to the rainbow road sprawling from the island.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bank
settled back into his seat, breathing heavily. &quot;(I freaking
heard that you..) Yeah, I did that with the telescope thing.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His palm
slid onto his left thigh. &quot;William, you are simply spectacular!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yeah.
Sure.&quot; Banktoad distantly dropped that tuft of hair he'd pulled
from The Captain. &quot;And I'm sorry.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Me
too. May we proceed?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Huh?
Uh. Y-yeah I guess-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
Captain stomped the accelerator a fraction of a second before the
hostages regained their bearings. The steepness and speed going up
that newly formed ramp flung them into the wagon's rear cabin,
colliding with glass bottles with a tremendous clang as the sirens
and lights caught up.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
Captain adjusted a mirror. &quot;Who knew pigs could fly?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Pull
over!&quot; buzzed from the hovering space cruiser. Several warnings
later, it unleashed super scope blasts, turning the kart into swiss
cheese. A door latch was blown off, ejecting everything and everyone
in the trunk. The plumber, toad, and bottles slammed the solid ground
of the connected island.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The next
thing Luigi remembered was being numb all over, spitting up grit
while on his knees and elbows. Toad, disguised as a lump of mud to
his side, or the other way around, gave a sign he was a-okay,
rewarded for lying obviously when a blur buried him deeper in sand as
it came across. The airtight hatch clicked, released steam, and
lifted upwards.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Give
it your all, Delta,&quot; Snifit Patrol cryptically spoke into his
radio.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi's
head stopped spinning from whatever that was. &quot;Officer-
we..Who..?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Have
no fear Mr. Luigi, I will arrest the scum of the Earth who inverted
all of your pockets-&quot; (Stunned, the men then noticed their coats
and pants like that) &quot;-Crossed seven kingdoms illegally, and
kidnapped you! Now let's kick it.&quot; He plucked the toad right up,
like the vegetables in Subcon.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Thanks,
Sumeet..&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad's
expression remained brittle through the invite inside the cruiser.
This entire time he was worried about encountering someone that knew
him while he was obviously on a date, when the real danger was
another red toad who's known his secret for ages now. As much as that
sucked, this patrol car's intense, rocket like ride made up for it.
There were more vibrant rainbows bridging islands, red and green
cheep cheeps leaping out of the water underneath in choreographed
formations, and they saw it all up close.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;This
is a phenomenal metaphysical projecting device.&quot; The green
plumber geeked out over the Vrlrdyi Scope, eighteen inches by
estimate, very light, non-telescoping, and inscribed around the
barrel in a spidery language. &quot;How does it know what to cast?
Might it be sapient? Does it read nerve endings? Can I find a manual
somewhere?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
laughed weakly, easing up. &quot;Just find out.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well, he
didn't expect Luigi to aim the telescope in his face.</font></p>
<hr/>

Wendy-chan, and it made everybody leave our Princess Parlor discord.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
crossed one leg over the other. &quot;I'm not! I'm vibing in my salt

talk to him.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The canoe
rocked when he skeptically sat on the other end. &quot;You got some
explaining to do sis. I sorta hyped up that I'd have an epic battle
with you. Besides I thought you were like King Dad. You don't like
toads and hate twilight?&quot;</font></p>

her knuckles in the water to hide the pain, nonetheless proud he'd
toughened up &quot;Here's why I'm like shook, Iggy. I've already
triple crossed the line, but I gotta keep going to contrast Luddy.
I'm not misanthropic like him, I do love people, if they listen to me

twiddled his thumbs. &quot;Entirely so, Wendy-chan. The more of the
outside world I analyze with my sensors, the less I can ignore that
my talents are kinda underutilized here. Plus I think Lemmy dumped me
as his BFF. I've teleported five hundred times now and no amount of
coding or doing tech support calls fills the void. We have a
predicament don't we?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Gosh,
somebody gets it.&quot; She wrinkled her nose as this huge ocean
liner came up, a senior oriented one with no amusement to be found,
with the audacity to honk like they were in the way. She flung a ring
at it, striking the hull and it didn't even sink like what the movie
'Toadtanic' taught her. &quot;Brought headphones to drown that drab
thing out?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy
rotated the small plastic square case in his paw, reminded of who it
came from.. If these dark stars entities could use up someone in a
day or two, he had to sever their hold on sister. &quot;Right here
sis. It's playing.. 'I need 'A Doctor Mario'. Yikes, Dr. Greg got hit

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Her
appendages roved on their own, taking the left piece. There was a
jounce in the ocean princess as, eyes widened, she swiftly snatched
the right earphone and inserted his. They partied and jammed from the

them.</font></p>

the meteor rock where the dark matter pools could not reach, over
scattered fresh bones, around larger drier ones embedded in the
ground, and dodging blackening debris piles, mostly a conglomerate of
&lsquo;borrowed&rsquo; Earth soil, but with the pungent odor of death
and the source of the trails of some festering liquid. Had his very
very distant friends plunged as well? Pinned under the weight of
those worries, he fell flat, his glow revealing every sordid detail

compliment I&rsquo;ve ever heard,&rdquo; he laughed dryly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Millennium
Star shifted closer, concerned. &ldquo;Don't you miss your family?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The dark
boo&rsquo;s jaw tightened, forgetting he was already backed up
against an object. &ldquo;No!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
are you holding then?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
clutched the photo under his hand in panic.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Feast
your eyes on this.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
don&rsquo;t have my glasses old man..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
will not need them.&rdquo; Millennium Star projected his Book of
Casualty, a window into the past. The open middle page showed Dr.
Toad swamped with study notes, wearing those sweaters, long sleeves,
and khaki pants he frequented to hide his &lsquo;tribal&rsquo; marks
from hybrid boo lineage and blend in with red toads at Mushroom
College.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His
brother discovered Zoo&rsquo;s &lsquo;Death Ray&rsquo; made breaks in
DNA cells in scientific terms, akin to radiation, and with that
understanding he sought to repurpose it benevolently, or perhaps
defensively. Anything but what it was then with his dark boo brother
maiming or killing people randomly. Zoo felt a stab in his chest
recalling his reaction to that discussion later, how on reflex, like
scratching an itch, he ventured into his head. He didn&rsquo;t want
to be dissected like some experiment. Fleeing to their parents was no
better. Lou deteriorated back home, forgetting names of his children,
who was older or younger, etc, and Sue Sr., the toad parent was
consumed with caregiving. Afraid of abandonment, Zoo took the first
steps and high tailed on his own-</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Freakin
cut it out!&rdquo; He begged, resting on the tear soaked ashes
underneath him. &ldquo;Like, whatever anyway. Airship&rsquo;s
sailed.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Millennium
Star dissipated the illusions. &ldquo;Your brother risked the empire
he built to respond to your letter. Your old commander has acquitted
you of the Special Object ordeal. Tanner is reminiscing about you
perpetually and, despite his efforts to honor your wish, I will
&lsquo;cheat&rsquo; and foresee that.. Ah yes. Your vote for-&rdquo;
A smile overtook him. &ldquo;Ho ho, you improved your literacy for
him. How.. sweet. Well, the only hole you cannot dig out of is the
grave.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Making a
face, &ldquo;Bro, we're in one!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-And
that is why I am not one of those auspicious heroes with axioms of
good will prevail blah blah. I will be truthful.&rdquo; He thumped
the ground hard, shaking the planetoid and the abominable mounds,
flipping the tombs. &ldquo;I am a god of chaos, as are you with your
mind, fascinating as a broken clock once said. (I&rsquo;d know. I am
one!) Your resurgence would be nothing short of </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">fun</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">.
Disregard what the others implied, you will not regret this.&rdquo;
There was a mutual glimmer of mischief between them following that.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Tensed
shoulders dropping, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come home, I mean I guess-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Splendid!&rdquo;
Millennium Star attached to the dark boo and skipped the launch star,
rocketing them through the galaxy on his own, exponentially growing
power.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">In
Bowser&rsquo;s New Castle, the buzzing neon sign and squeaks of
minion shoes as they settled down was the only sound outside of
distant thunder claps.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo; <font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Forgot
your little &lsquo;mission&rsquo; didn't&rsquo; ya? When in Rome..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Perhaps,&rdquo;
he groaned. &ldquo;As the stars might not align our paths again, I
must confess I was wrong to dismiss your career here. It is not some
&lsquo;phase&rsquo; and you are respected and- g-g-g-&rdquo; he
struggled.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Uh
huh?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">MorethanadequateatyourjobJ.D!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ha!!
What made it click in that hard head, Stone?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Your
willingness to work with Larry. Why don&rsquo;t we move aside for
him?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Spotted
all along, the supernaturally bleached white haired koopaling stepped
from behind the corner, pissed. At least they weren&rsquo;t snitches.
He tapped on the ceiling high red door with the knocker.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">YEAH??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
gulped. &ldquo;Dad, it&rsquo;s me.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">COME
IN. AND QUIETLY.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Eek!&rdquo;
The fifteen year old crept through. Bowser&rsquo;s throne, actually
an office chair, was against the back wall, stacks of chests to the
right, a poster of Mario doing a V sign on the left, and then an
actual desk before him with a laptop. Plans and blueprints were
stacked, verging on messily, but decent by his standards. Bowser
lifted from his latest plan, chair compressing from his weight shift.
&ldquo;K?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
approached the desk, staring at his toes. &ldquo;Umm.. So Luddy was
obsessed with those Council of Conscientious Villainy hipsters and
in, umm, in their archives the motto &lsquo;Take a slice of their
pie&rsquo; came from, they claim I mean&hellip;your brother.&rdquo;
He dared to look at his father head on. Bowser was picture still.
&ldquo;Sounds like tycoon stuff. So why do you think a guy like that
woulda been better leadin us?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The king
sighed and laughed simultaneously, relaxing. &ldquo;Growing up,
Clarentine was always running off while I was homebodied. Yeah, you&rsquo;d
never guess. Then the war started and never.. Stopped in a way.&rdquo;
He coughed the raggedness out of his voice, tossing the silver pen
into the #1 villain coffee mug. &ldquo;-Er, in retrospect, King
Morton saw the writing on the wall and one of us two had to keep this
thang going..&rdquo; He typed clunkily for a sec, then swiveled the
laptop around.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
artistic reproduction might have been discussed in a freshman class
of Larry&rsquo;s. He&rsquo;d know for sure if he wasn&rsquo;t
skipping so much.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">In
Kingly Law mythology, three cosmic koopas &lsquo;G&rsquo;, &lsquo;O&rsquo;
and &lsquo;D&rsquo; held this planet up by </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">never
moving</font></em> <font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">or
listening to anyone telling them to. That&rsquo;s why it's so hard
for us Darklandians to be flexible at times, even when what we&rsquo;re
doing over and over ain&rsquo;t working.&rdquo; Unlocking a memory,
Bowser rolled the chair, facing a window battered heavily by rain.
Lighting flashed miles off, volcanos revealed in silhouette. &ldquo;Erm,
so it was time for dad to judge. Couldn&rsquo;t be in person. He was
already hafin ta run. I copied dad in my half of the territory, and
Clarentine, oh boy.. He had traders comin in and out, fixed the ph
balance to farm and set up a monopoly thing, the goal to literally
buy our enemies out. Was never going to work, not cause we were too
stupid even though we probably were, but he just wasn&rsquo;t ready
himself to do things different. Clarentine wept and scrammed. I won
by default.&rdquo; Bowser decided that he should tug that lever to
raise the chair, so he wasn&rsquo;t sunk to the floor. &ldquo;Whenever
I&rsquo;d fail I&rsquo;d fall back in time. Wonder if he was right..
So Lawrence.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
signed a document, his hunched posture obscuring the glistening in
his eyes. &ldquo;Whether you stick with the Troop, or go off and play
music, I&rsquo;m fine with either at this point, don&rsquo;t leave
question marks in your life.&rdquo;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Where
will you go?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
will find out later!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Why
do I have a hunch already?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Because
we&rsquo;ve been acquainted for- hmm?...&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
get it, Yosh, haha.&rdquo; The red plumber locked up the screen door
under the hot sun. What good it did when his home had been busted
into twice in one weekend, he was uncertain. It was a habit is all he
supposed, like it was for his long time dinosaur friend to leash his
dog outside when he knew such measures were a suggestion at best.
Mario had a heavy duty garbage bag over his shoulders, the bust
pieces inside going to Russ T. (Yoshi&rsquo;s suggestion, very
proudly) for consultation. &ldquo;Happy house hunting!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wherever
Yoshi was looking, Mario suspected it wouldn&rsquo;t be far.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi went
tch. He could not predict him! It was only a coincidence Pleasant
Path was scenic, the sidewalks so smooth, the planters brimming with
flowering plants delectable to his large nose. The blue mushroom home
with the lights off was Gill T.&rsquo;s abode, who thought he was
neighborhood watch. The Kuribo shoe styled one belonged to Dr.
Fungenstein, a frizzy haired retired researcher who cackled into
stormy nights and badmouthed his brother from Rogueport. Others were
red toads mostly and they were unique certainly, Yoshi just had other
priorities...</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oof!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Excuse
me buddy!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dragging
himself up, Yoshi recognized the teal shell and called him back.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Apologizes,
Mr. Munchakoopas. Catch!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The dino
caught the lightweight box. &ldquo;Thank-&rdquo; He read the label,
mouth hanging. &ldquo;-You?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
to Peach castle-&rdquo; The mailman tapped rapidly into a scanner. &ldquo;I
wasn&rsquo;t being followed to had trouble visiting there or
anything. I&rsquo;m only five-hundred letters late on this scorcher
of a day.&rdquo; He saluted nervously. &ldquo;Thank you for using
Toad Town Postl!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~&rsquo;The
Fabulous Birdo&rsquo;, a heart drawn around the inscription, sending
gifts to &lsquo;Mr. Toad&rsquo;.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">At the
other end of the avenue, Mario sat on a toad proportioned wooden
stool, listening to the local personality, now out of the spotlight
since his shtick was rendered neolithic by online message boards. No
less spirited, however. Russ T. kept his space dignified and shelves
of books tidy despite signs of heavy use. He knew more about
Darklandian customs that Mario thought he did, or maybe until now
he'd never asked. All was well until he mentioned those attacks on
toads yesterday.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
ran up to the dinosaur waiting on his porch. &quot;Did Luigi mention
when he'd return? It's about Boo.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No
he didn't Mario, and-&quot; Yoshi watched Mario check that package
out. He should have hid it, because with a steamy breath, Mario's
grip crushed a corner of it. &quot;Oh that. Umm, scandalous, isn't
it?..&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;If
Toad is swooping in on your old girl like that, it's beyond that!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah,
except that's platonic, Yoshi screamed inside!</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Years ago
after he splurged on a Parade Cart, he and Birdo made gratuitous
trips anywhere around the kingdom (also the reason that didn't last).
Visiting some club, 'Chimera', they stumbled upon Toad in the back.
He was horrified at the sight of them, to the point of gagging.
Judging by the speed dating cards he dropped on the way out, he had a
specific type and it wasn't pink dinosaurs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-So, with
that in mind, he decided it was safer to keep Mario on that road.
Adopting indignation suddenly, he punted the box away, a touch too
hard. It hurled across the street, deflected off a metal mail
receptacle, bumped off a passing kart, and crashed into somebody's
window.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;&hellip;Now
you have an excuse to meet a semi-new neighbor!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
trudged to their doorstep and knocking, noticed a mangled fingerprint
keypad attached to a jiggling handle.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Sir
or ma'am, I must apologize for-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It swung
open less than an inch, the interior dark, unleashing the rasp of a
toad, &quot;Relax. I have insurance&hellip; &hellip; &hellip;! -&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A strollin
stu revved up an ear splittingly loud weed whacker next door.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hold
on.. What does that groundskeeper look like?&quot; the homeowner
repeated, undecipherable to Yoshi. At the same time, a magnificent
glider swept across the sky, the pilot blending into the black
triangle above. The tail flowing behind it spelled 'G-O-A-W-A-Y!'</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi fell
into their home, flopping back onto the hardwood. There were scraping
sounds and the natural light was blocked. Abducted, and by- He gasped
leaning up, spots in his vision from the change in lighting. The room
was chock full of spy equipment, racks of weapons, radars, and
monitors, the only thing that should belong the couch in front of a
NES Classic equipped TV. SMB3 was paused in world 3.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sonny..&rdquo;
Yoshi caught his breath. &ldquo;Ugh. Not how I thought we&rsquo;d
rendezvous.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Me
neither, Mr. Munchakoopas. I&rsquo;ve been here for eight months and
we&rsquo;d met before the coast guard thing. I didn&rsquo;t expect
you to pick up on it because I was an unremarkable red toad on
purpose.&rdquo; The nineteen year old secured bolt locks from the top
to the bottom, ammo steadily spilling from his tactile vest with
every movement. His left foot was in a homemade cast and an ugly deep
scar split across what once movie star perfect visage. &ldquo;Think
this&rsquo;ll hold?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ah,
well, Mario is less than fifty feet away.&rdquo; Yoshi got a better
look around. Pinup posters of koopa &lsquo;thots&rsquo; were
plastered behind the work stuff, some risqu&eacute;, and bookshelf
current blocked the window he&rsquo;d damaged. (Said books E-rated,
Phew) &ldquo;We should call him.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
really shouldn&rsquo;t. I got it. I so have this under control. Ha ha
ha!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
swept him away by that too big vest. &ldquo;This is serious Emerson!
There are no old bold pilots, or coast guards, or spies, whatever you
are, so get it together and stop being reckless!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
know!&rdquo; He limped around his room, clutching at both sides of
his red capped head. &ldquo;That might of been a manic episode.
Sorry. My HQ is in shambles and what&rsquo;s left of it&rsquo;s
trying to kill me over a boatload of coincidences, misunderstandings,
and our Spy Captain having an unscheduled lobotomy this morning.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi saw
another version of himself, softening. &ldquo;Okay, wait. I&rsquo;m
involved now anyway, so from the top.&rdquo; He retrieved the package
from the shards. &ldquo;Was this the impetus of the hit on you?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Correct
Anti-Guy wants that. He and Charles probably intercepted the mail
services and tracked the package into town. I&rsquo;m not sure how
you got it, the mail guy sounds lenient, but yeah. Therein lies the
problem with the telephone game and a chain of spies.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He ripped
the package open in front of him. A golden Phantoe Mask fell to the
floor with the scrap.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
prop of Birdo&rsquo;s&rdquo; he breathed.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
really? Cool. But it&rsquo;s not the Bronze Egg they were assuming it
was.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There was
a huge bang, loud as an explosion at the entrance and with the force
of such, knocking them off their feet, followed by more. Objects were
shook off the walls and sheetrock cracked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sonny
crawled backwards until the joining room. &ldquo;I thought Mario out
there would keep them off!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A scream
threatened to rise from Yoshi&rsquo;s throat, sliding that bookcase
over a tad. His plumber friend hadn&rsquo;t left the scene. He was in
his lawn, just sprawled out on his back, limp with a red dart in his
neck.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">This might
incite mockery, so be it. He respected and had always wanted to
allocate space for vigilantes like the Snifit Patrol to serve their
citizens. It wasn&rsquo;t shirking responsibility, not if he and his
brother did enough work for the entire US army in the real world.
Soft bed. Now.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A patio
sliding door shut. &ldquo;Mhm. I&rsquo;d offer some adventure
conclusion congratulatory champagne, but they spawn vines for some
reason-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah,
don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Luigi permitted himself to smile five layers of
under. The muted roar of the running water and comforting smells of
some baked good were sufficiently lulling without alcohol. There came
the patter of feet, the sudden absence of it.. He braced
instinctively as someone thunk next to him&hellip; Eh not that bad of
a bounce, not with the snuggling that ensued afterwards.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
glanced up at the ceiling made of bamboo rods. A redesign?...
&ldquo;Closer,&rdquo; he whispered, peering into rich dark brown
eyes, gleaming with energy. The short muscular arms of the toad
pulled him in by the waist with one arm, behind his back with the
other into tight, longing cuddles. Welling with serenity, warmth
spread throughout the human despite their &lsquo;unsexy&rsquo; thick
woolen and long pajamas. Nothing explosive, he was pleased the same
with their intimacy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-That
sounded like a... Are you outsourcing work in the castle?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;..I
was wondering that myself,&quot; Toad lifted from straddling him and
they stared.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">This
isn&rsquo;t your bed,&rdquo; they droned in unison.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
flipped off of each other, bashfully scanning the themed suite. Tiki
lights were on each side of the king bed, electric flames lighting
the tatami floor, the bamboo furniture, and glass wall leading out to
a patio. A telescope was propped near it, aimed at a chillingly blue
moon. The ocean tide low, Sidesteppers zigzagged around innumerable
objects, unplucked treasures scintillating on the beach, which also
held, a netted tennis court, a golf course further back, and a water
park farther, closed for the night. Back indoors, tight bleed from
under the door out, objects or people blocking it occasionally. They
knew they were in a full on resort.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;ll
return then,&rdquo; the servant informed.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Tada!&rdquo;
Toad laughed as he slid off. &ldquo;This is how the scope works.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
swung his legs over the edge. And&hellip; Not what he expected.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Y-you
could have warned it&rsquo;s this immersive!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
wasn&rsquo;t a good sprint to the patio glass either. Luigi pressed
against it, apparently forgetting it had a latch. &ldquo;Is there an
exit? What&rsquo;s the parameter? Are we on a physical plane?&rdquo;
He reached for the fringes of Toad&rsquo;s half buttoned shirt, then
beyond that, feeling around his hairless chest so academically it
didn&rsquo;t register what he was doing. &ldquo;Okay, so far this
checks out.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
other stuff checked out too, heh heh.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His arms
returned to his sides, flushed. &ldquo;T-toad!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">If
this was overstepping I&rsquo;m sorry! I wanted to do something wild
with you because, I know this is early but, I love you. I don&rsquo;t
expect to hear it back, just saying.&rdquo; He forced some liveliness
again. &ldquo;But yeah I think we&rsquo;re the only people that
aren&rsquo;t Skylandian that know about this.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi spun
him his way by both shoulders. &ldquo;-Why, is there a catch? Do you
never wake up sometimes?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
leaned into his ear, or as close as he could. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s..simpler.
They were up in, you know, the clouds and pretty introverted folks. I
think you can sympathize with that.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He rolled
his eyes. &ldquo;Toad, I love you,&rdquo; slipped out, quite easily
actually. &ldquo;Is it also as simple as checking out? We didn't
waste any dream dollars on this room did we?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Of
course not!&rdquo; In came the butler from before with a tray. Toad
and Luigi held where they were tentatively while the cover lifted
from the delicious Couples Cake. &ldquo;I hoped we would share this
someday.&rdquo; The scowling bowtie wearing boo diddly letting the
dessert splat on the floor, whipping out a racket, glinting in the
moonlight.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Two
objects clashed with a sonic clap! Luigi peeked over his shielding
elbow where a blue mushroom emblem racket was holding it off.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Where&rsquo;d
that come from??&rdquo; Booigi growled.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Shoulda
read the pamphlet, kid,&rdquo; Toad quipped.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo socked
him in the stomach. Toad folded over, then pulled them down with him,
releasing a carton of golf balls to trip Boo up. He stuffed a
flotation tire from over their head, to blind them and another whack
sent the boo over the bed. Luigi reached until he found the Bowser
racket while the boo rebound all over the room, destroying
everything. He made his shot with the fury of the game he never got
to play in, slicing them into orbit- or through the glass, spilling
onto the patio. The human and toad scrambled out, bare feet even, to
catch up to the jealous ex embedded in the sand. If Saul T. was the
Genesis of Booigi&rsquo;s rampage, this was the </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Revelation</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Boo,
stop this now!! I barely knew you were pining for me like that. Look,
it won't work, sorry, for reasons besides you hating toads when the
bad ones have been gone now for decades. You're too young. We could
be friends, but that's it, unless of you keep hanging out with
vindictive toad-hating lunatics. Who could that have been, even?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After a
realization, Toad dropped the champagne bottle he was welding.
&quot;Appropriately his name rhymes with witch.&quot;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Banktoad
coiled like a rusted spring the longer the search prolonged around
the sand fortress of the mushroom shaped Water Land island. When the
wind blew the brigade were smoldered by the burning fumes of the kart
that brought them there, smoking from the engine blowing up. They&rsquo;d
all gotten out and pushed it the rest of the way, through knee-high
marshland, some of them wishing they were in that luxury jetliner
instead, yes the one that almost fell out of the sky..</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-We
saved the treasure already! Why are we still sorting through that
stuff??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Unanswered,
Banktoad thawed seeing blue toad with the cracked glasses implacable
for once. That made sense, Bank would recall. He kept babbling,
afraid of &lsquo;sirens&rsquo; in the water earlier.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Captain,&rdquo;
Hint spoke up. &ldquo;Are you having a merry time over there?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
Captain gasped, pulling his nose from the indigo vest. &ldquo;Ah!
Why, of course,&rdquo; he chuckled, tucking it in a pocket. &ldquo;Ah
hem. Where is our trader?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">From
around the fortress sautered a tepid koopaling. Sans her signature
bow, loose bleached hair danced across her forehead with each step in
the heels. She was also, the brigade all sharing the same face for a
moment, not who they expected from the all caps request. They had no
clue either why she&rsquo;d used the pseudonym RAP (as in hip hop?).
Perhaps not being able to hold a tune explained her awful mood from
the jump, refusing to extend for The Captain meeting her half way.
That shoulder was so cold he felt it, snow flurries speckling down.
Wendy snuck a glance around. It was told to her that her weather
powers took a break, so it was good they were returning.. Maybe.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Greetings
Princess Wendy! As equal opportunity artifact hunters we are in fact
not perturbed over you being the client-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Someone
loudly coughed behind him.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Deal,
princess?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Listen
sugar..One thing..I can get that Jewel of the Stars, but only after..
You do a lil&rsquo; something.. For me..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He snapped
his fingers impatiently, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re busy, young lady. Come on
boys, time to push the car all the way back home-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wendy
huffed, delicately holding her earpiece in. None of this was how she
planned, but the voice guiding was so insistent.. &ldquo;Chill! It&rsquo;s
in Mayor Koton&rsquo;s office. Right now, my &lsquo;informant&rsquo;
said. I can trade it for your totally chic uh, &lsquo;Bronze Egg&rsquo;
if you get me in the office. How? Get Mr. Toad to drop out with your
famous impression-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yes!&rdquo;
he squeed, voice rising an octave.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">NO!&rdquo;
The brigade rushed the blushing Captain with complaints until he
snapped.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
must acquire that artifact! You should understand, William.&rdquo; He
jabbed his nephew. &ldquo;(That egg is C grade anyway. If she thinks
it is worth anything that&rsquo;s her problem..)&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The pallid
green toad nodded, his nerves grasped at.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The deal
revitalized, Wendy shook the leader&rsquo;s hand with the enthusiasm
of embracing Salvo the Slime, especially since his paws following
that mention of Mr. Toad had the same icky texture. &ldquo;IGGY!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy Delta
beamed next to his sister, present in body only. The rhythmic bobbing
of his half shaven head and mouthing of what sounded almost like
coordinates gave away that his earpiece matching Wendy&rsquo;s was
blasting math rock or similar. The Captain ripped his hat off,
headlamp, even shirt in front of everyone, to try on the indigo vest.
A different toad was unveiled then, his face broadening with
unbridled zeal.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;m
the best!&rdquo; he blared.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">OMG,
it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m in the room with that annoying little...
Good job.&rdquo; Wendy spared him a little applause. &ldquo;Iggy,
like, video record &lsquo;Mr. Toad&rsquo; dropping out. We show this
to Koton and it&rsquo;s game over.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Her
brother brought a phone up lackadaisically. &ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you
gonna talk this out?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Do
I look like Luddy? We&rsquo;re flipping the script. And action!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yellow
Toad yawned, lumbering in the way. Before he was clobbered he caught
his captain&rsquo;s fist, wide awake. &ldquo;Hey! Guess what.&rdquo;
He suddenly dumped a giant bottle of extra strength PM cough syrup,
the oozing orange liquid spreading around his hiking books. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
gathered all my evidence, and some of you have some </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">interesting</font></em>
<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">to put it as
flatteringly as possible, dreams. I&rsquo;ll take this by the way.&rdquo;
He plundered the egg from Mailtoad&rsquo;s grasp.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mordecai!
That was William-&rdquo; (WTF, the nephew protested) &ldquo;-levels
of incompetence!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">But-
Captain.. I-&rdquo; the purple toad stammered, not doing much of
anything. His captain ran him over to get to Yellow Toad, unable to
hop for it yet again.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wendy face
palmed. &lsquo;Toadys&rsquo; fighting was like watching Junior&rsquo;s
little friends scrapping it out, about as close as they could get to
the adorable threshold in her eyes. The folly made the &lsquo;ally&rsquo;
in her ear easier to digest at least.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">J&ouml;rg,
give me that!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No
Stan, it's time I have lines.&rdquo; Steely, he rose a brow at Wendy.
&ldquo;Miss, would you like to learn the history of our infamous
brigade?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She filed
her nails. &ldquo;Not reeeeeally.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Na?
Don&rsquo;t spoil this my dear. The Toad Brigade formed with Stan and
Bill meeting for the first time in a geology college class. The
remainder of us were assembled on campus. I am sure you&rsquo;ve
heard of the rest of our travels until the last with Toadette, after
which we separated, richly rewarded. Heinemann returned to teaching.
Mordecai went to the post office and those were the only months Toad
Town's delivery system worked efficiently, and I- investigative
research.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
Captain stopped hopping, glaring. &ldquo;And you learned what,
Sherlock??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
gleaned and you and Bill took on a new and exciting position too.
What was it about that middle of the night call to reassemble? You
proposed we research, excavate, and catalog artifacts, not to curate
for a museum, to expunge. Why? Might it be to profit off of your
'nephew&rsquo;s -HWUH!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
Captain strangled the life out of him on the spot so suddenly
everyone froze.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Now this
was getting good, Wendy thought until a handcuff was slapped on one
wrist. &ldquo;You're under arrest!&rdquo; announced Snifit Patrol.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">IGGY
HEEEEEELP!&rdquo; she screeched, cracking the windshield of his
patrol car parked downhill.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Reality
rushed back to Luigi and Toad within. It took convincing that they
were actually awake with the fogged up windows and snow flurries
swirling in the tropics. They managed to spill out and those vertical
flipping doors and tumbled over each other into slush. They clung
automatically in the frigid temperatures. The palm trees and tropical
foliage were dead or had icicles hanging, ice cubes bobbed in the
ocean, and the sand castle ahead was frosted over.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
snagged the plumber before he dove into the fray. &ldquo;Luigi. Let
Sumeet do his job.&rdquo; He was blinked at. &ldquo;... Don&rsquo;t
worry, your internal monologue is safe with me,&rdquo; he whispered
huskily.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The height
difference placed Toad&rsquo;s head midway up his ribcage, though his
disposition had no issue traveling the rest of the way up, Luigi
grinning back. &ldquo;I'm obligated to do something, aren&rsquo;t I?
I&rsquo;ll just monitor,&rdquo; he whined playfully.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">For once
Toad didn&rsquo;t take it jokingly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want it to
become compulsive or hollow like what happened with Mario. That&rsquo;s
all. You&rsquo;re freezing stiff by the way.&rdquo; He slipped his
hand under Luigi&rsquo;s dress coat, circling his lower back.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Valid
points. Darn it. How did he do it ?</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-What?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Warm
me up.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">From his
tip toes, the toad eagerly pressed his lips on him, rearing them
back, pinning him against the kart. He became hot, yet he shivered.
They were goofing off! Wasting time! Yet it stopped. Luigi wasn&rsquo;t
initially sure if that&rsquo;s what he was asking for, but he got the
answer quickly. It was explosive.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
motionless occupant with discolored knots all over their body was
going to speak up at some point from the back seat. Blushing, they
borrowed the Bowser racket for one more stunt and poofed away. They
got the message.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
piercing wail was Wendy&rsquo;s ticket away from that masked
nuisance. She flung off her heels and ran frantically, like fleeing a
party she and friends had no business in, climbing up the wall of the
castle until she was at the tallest spire. It hit her, what was she
doing?? Looking down on them, she got vertigo seeing the entire
island blanketed in white.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy
beamed with her again, grappling with her in the small cone shaped
space. &ldquo;Watashi wa makeru wake niwa ikanai!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re saying!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~Someone
uses dubs over subs!&rdquo; he sang whimsically.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Shut
up! If we&rsquo;re gonna brawl, brawl.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
prefer Melee.&rdquo; Iggy unsheathed a short newly invented Beam
Sword 8000. The screen split diagonally, brother and sister on
opposite sides, baring teeth, claws out, lightning bolts from one
pupil to the other. In his mind at least. The Wendy menace would be
defeated and he would be a star.<br/>
&hellip;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;And
they considered US tire kickers..&quot; The Captain muttered, hanging
partially out the window below that skirmish.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Stanley,
quit it already!&quot; Banktoad urged, pulling him from that
precarious space. &quot;Dismiss the brigade again, and let's move
back to Mushroom City. (Like I wanted to get through to you in the
car..) I'll manage my kleptomania and every other way I'm messed up.
I promise.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
Captain chuckled, pinching his jaws like he was four, about
twenty-five years before they ever met. &quot;As tempting as that is
William, the only thing I adore more than you is when I have an
opportunity to use my Mr. Toad impression.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bank toad
rocked the Bronze Egg back and forth with his foot, retrieved during
that police busting confusion. &quot;Can't you in private..like-&quot;
He paused as the stragglers tried to push into the passage they were
in from the opposite side of the sandstone door, securely propped
shut with a one ton backpack. &quot;-Like you used to drive me nuts
within that thin walled apartment we had? Oh and-&quot; He pried The
Captain's fingers off, snapping them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;OUCH
yes,&quot; he shrieked, &quot;Hah.. But you see, having it recorded
and viewed by millions? You cannot ignore that we have the same spot
pattern, blood type, height, and physique. I am identical to Mr. Toad
K Toad, in every way,&quot; he boasted, eyes glimmering. &quot;I'd be
cemented as his number one.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;..What?
Because he hates you back. Fan?&quot; Bank stared a little harder,
The Captain never learning how to human enough to interpret it. &quot;Are
you really asexual?&quot; he asked bluntly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His grin
was wiped right off. &quot;I said I didn't date anyone,&quot; he
corrected.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bank took
one step closer. &quot;Interesting.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Why??
Are you jealous over my feelings?&quot; Skittishly The Captain took
the egg again, holding it like a shield between them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The one
armed toad stopped where he was, biting his lip. &quot;God, how you
were on point for once? </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yes</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">,
because I have no one else duh. But.. we can't hide how we perpetuate
each other any more. You're just as dependent on me!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
Captain swallowed that lump in his throat. &quot;I suppose J&ouml;rg
was on to something. Despite our quarrelling, I appreciate you this
much-&quot; Some part of his brain going haywire, he tossed aside
that tacky egg to latch onto the green toad and give him a
gentlemanly kiss on the cheek.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bank held
him there, caressing his face. &quot;Ah. Well. I don't know why I
want to do this but-&quot; He tongued him, a soft purr escaping from
The Captain spontaneously. They pulled apart then at the same time,
the short encounter exactly as viscerally confusing as they'd both
imagined.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I'm
still gonna do the impression.&quot; the flushed Captain squeaked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh
come on! I gave in for nothing?&quot; His nephew's lunge for him
froze upon a small controlled detonator activation, blowing the door
open. Sandstone blocks and debris from the adventure pack propagated,
clouding a passage that Snifit Patrol cut through unhindered. He
tased the Captain and Banktoad so that they both collapsed on the
spot disoriented. Yellow Toad crept from behind the handcuffing
officer for the egg in the corner. It was evil he could psychically
detect.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Drop
that evidence!&quot; the officer ordered too late.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yellow
Toad hurled it out the window.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A shiny
object whizzing by koopalings. Wendy kicked off her brother, reaching
out in vain from the roof as it plunged into chilly waters. &quot;No
no nooo!&quot; He stopped her from diving into the ocean, just
barely.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hint Toad,
from the shore area where his own Captain had subdued him earlier,
witnessed firsthand the impact spot bubble and blacken, spreading out
steadily, darkening even the icebergs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">WELL DONE
FREEING MY DUMB SILENT FRIEND MUNCHZTAR INSTEAD.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With bated
breaths, the siblings on the roof shook out the earpods.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">NICE TRY.
I AM GOD OF INDULGENCE RAPSCINTILLATION. I AM NOT CHAINED TO ONE
MORTAL TO CARRY OUT MY PURPOSE LIKE OTHER LOSERS. HA. HA. HA.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lips broke
apart back at the police car. The toad and human, shed coats off on
the snow, many buttons undone on both, stepped apart in a feverish
daze before purple toad that ran up on them. As Mailtoad hauntingly
directed their attention over some, the lovebirds' hearts pumped
rapidly for a different reason.</font></p>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ignatius H
Koopa was notorious for: inventing, graduating at twelve, changing
his hair color genetically, believing in the Fang-Fairy, and
programming a chess-playing AI so proficient it was classified
self-aware and monitored by some governments.. In aggregate he should
have thwarted the &lsquo;Wendy Menace&rsquo;, yet oily goop skimmed
the ocean beyond his technologically aided perception, and cheep
cheeps, dolphins, jelectro, and bloopers squirmed helplessly.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Noooooooo!...Psyche!&ldquo;
On the sand castle rooftop, Wendy O. Koopa lifted a megaphone.
&ldquo;YAAAS! All your water are belongs to me!!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy laser
eyed that to powder. &ldquo;-Wendy-chan, you&rsquo;re dangerously
underestimating what you&rsquo;re partnering with! It&rsquo;s Sirena
Beach all over again!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She pushed
away from him, the sun&rsquo;s resurgence through the winter storm
catching her blue eyes, the only element around that color as she
craned upwards, &ldquo;They can have the ocean back- which was mine
anyway in my opinion, if they vote for me Monday!&rdquo; Suddenly one
of her wrists was joined to the other with a metallic click.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You&rsquo;d
better rally from the big house then. You are under arrest for
conspiracy, pollution, and trading stolen property, young lady!&rdquo;
chimed Snifit Patrol, dragging her off the roof.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The first
she had to cross on the ground was the last she wanted to see. &ldquo;Next
time, leave the megaphone thing to me, homegirl.&quot;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
HATE TOOOOOAAAADDDSSS!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">While
dealing with paperwork on the spot, Snifit Patrol was pledged by the
commotion of the koopaling&rsquo;s aquatic enemies beating on the
patrol car with palm branches. He ordered Toad and Luigi to get out
of there, dumping five pounds of C-4 on them to protect themselves.
It dawned that a couple- many things weren&rsquo;t right, like the
koopaling captive being allowed to text already.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wendy.
Really?&ldquo; Luigi crouched, tapping the glass.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Her bottom
lip quivering, the teen silently pressed the cracked Bowserphone
against the glass. A rival Badlands High posse had commented on her
blog:</font></p>
<p><em>&lsquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey
emo princess. If you want that prince, be ready because we want him
too and it will be on sight. If not, you will be accused of &lsquo;teh
ghey&rsquo;. Either way, expect ostracism!!!&rsquo;</font></em> 
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
straightened his posture, brushing against Toad whose own response
was caught in the back of his throat, especially with Iggy about to
creep up on them. Luigi at least managed some astute remark- &ldquo;How
about you focus on your bail first? Then that other stuff.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
stuff? Baka!&rdquo; Iggy exclaimed. &ldquo;&lsquo;Queen&rsquo; Wendy
O. is a serial grifter, manipulator, and pity party hostess-.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Gosh
shut up!&rdquo; She beat against the back of the seat. &ldquo;My life
is over, for real, all because some prick took a selfie at the last
prom precisely when I happened to stand too close to this Prince of
Nimbus Land douche. I don&rsquo;t &lsquo;like&rsquo; him or anyone at
school but even if I could fly rockets like you I don&rsquo;t think I
could ever outrun the rumors! I can&rsquo;t toss money at this and
make it go away! I can&rsquo;t rely on old Anti-Ma friends. Now I
won&rsquo;t even be mayor, where for once I&rsquo;d have some
autonomy. Don&rsquo;t you get it??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dumbstruck,
Iggy shifted away from the cop car. &ldquo;..So, Luigi and Toad-san..
Before you go..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The cyborg
koopaling produced his tablet again with a live satellite feed. A
dark red mass orbited their planet, mass perceivably increasing in
dimension. He also faxed over a passage from Ludwig, though his way
probably drove the point home already.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Reading
that note was the worst thing she could have done. Every country road
she memorized melted together- crystallized rather in the nippy
weather. The pink toad girl leaned against the ostro stop, tuckered
out, wishing she endured the piercing radio Daisy kept messing with
in the Birthday Girl. Her compass acting strange, she kicked the pole
and then had to dodge the falling icicles.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Howdy,
Probabilly K. here. Sorry fer the delay. Ice on the wings..&rdquo; A
paratroopa in a dark blue jumpsuit approached, offering his machine
oil stained hand intrepidly. &ldquo;Whatcha need darlin?&ldquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
gingerly took his hand. Notably when they let go, the janitor
immediately went to hugging himself up, shivering. &ldquo;I was
trying to locate my- a friend. He is either a blue toad and 5&rsquo;0
or a fifty story tall, three headed-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He swooped
her over frosted over prairies until in the sparsely populated shanty
town, where he got dicey, diving, spiraling at random, and it wasn&rsquo;t
like the toad girl could safely ditch him. Would he make up his
mind??</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Meanwhile,
Paper Macho friend actors unanimously kicked out a cowboy through the
swinging doors of the theater. He shook off the red dust, rushing
back.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">At
least give me a week for the mustache, it&rsquo;ll be darker.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The snifit
director replied, &ldquo;Our head&rsquo;s still split&rsquo;n from
yer wails of &lsquo;YA-HOO!&rsquo;. Walk on home boy!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Disgruntled
actors tossed props, paper cacti with real spikes, barrels, and the
kitchen sink at him as he backed into Toadette, just dropped in.
Together they escaped down another street, the toad girl finally
getting a decent look at her ex. Hard to miss against the rime
coating the South, Bucken-Berry glowed red still, otherwise he was
sound, she estimated, as cowpoke extra, in a red and white plaid
button up, denim jeans, and spurred leather boots, all a size off.
Probably missed because he hadn&rsquo;t been a toad for a while now,
peach fuzz shade his upper lip, one of the few toads that could grow
anything at all.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Babe,
lost track of time,&rdquo; he sputtered. &rdquo;You know, no watch
cause I didn&rsquo;t have arms this morning? Mr. Toad wired Drew a
ton of coins to blast more radiation off the books and it worked, I&rsquo;m
just &lsquo;dimorphic&rsquo; and we&rsquo;ll need more sessions to
fix that, but-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She kept
her focus on her scuffed shoes, trying to pave over that perfect
excuse Dr. Toad had to keep seeing him. &quot;Oh great!...&rdquo;
Abruptly shifting. &ldquo;What about you trying to join them back
there?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well,
most of the scripts have a Mario impersonator. I know it sounds crazy
but the theater was close and anything I&rsquo;ve ever wanted to do-
I just went for it.&hellip; You okay?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
walked a little longer then she spilled, &ldquo;Um. You implied you
could sense disturbances while in that previous form? Like with Mr.
Toadsworth? He wrote me this...&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><em>&lsquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~Miss
Toadette, if I do not explain now, this may be lost forever. Queen
Toadstool possessed an insatiable appetite for knowledge, especially
regarding the spiritual. Our princess was two months old when the
Queen retreated barefoot onto Star Hill. Our leaders knew losing her
had to do with the Stars above, falsifying the explanation of brain
fever for her demise. In retaliation, I concealed the Queen&rsquo;s
scrolls and &lsquo;utensils&rsquo; from them and now retribution has
arrived...</font></em> 
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Solemnly,
his rough textured hand slid over hers. &ldquo;I heard Ala-Gold on
Star Hill. I knew, well, his body&rsquo;s waiting to be shipped to
Ricco Harbor for burial, but that psycho imposter seemed so real...
Far as Mr. Toadsworth goes.. Let&rsquo;s not get caught up with
mistakes made before we were even born, just our own. Trust me,
babe.. It&rsquo;ll be okay. &rdquo; He closed in for a quick kiss on
the cheek.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She smiled
back at him, blushing. Cutting through an ice flower orchid of &lsquo;Lil
Oink Napoleon's&rsquo;, escapee Paper Macho Outlaws were chowing on
brittle rusty machinery. Craving fresher mechanical parts, they stomp
with a distinct rattle towards the fancy kart parked near a power
station, Daisy absorbed in switching radio bands.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
let go. &ldquo;Darn it..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Using the
picket fence for cover, the blue toad went one way, blasting paper
freaks into paper scraps and metal wires with his prop guns. Daisy
swiveled around wide eyed at the monsters, with an expletive or two.
Toadette went opposite of the commotion to sneak around, jump in the
car, and play GTA with those hooligans. When she smacked into a
Mecha-Yoshi, the first in a league of six heading over, she played
GTFO actually, scurrying away as their lasers ripped up farmland.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Pink and
blue toads managed to spill into the car with only a few skin graces
and burns, gritting their teeth and huddling low with Daisy under the
light show. Windows shattered. Tires burst. Green particles flowing
around induced weightlessness. That was new.. The princess rose her
head directly above..</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Gods,
finally,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;This is why I don&rsquo;t gotta
FCC in my kingdom. Nobody got time for this kinda suspense!&rdquo;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The small
shed with a beaten BMX bike chained against it became the dino&rsquo;s
salvation from certain death, the rest of the yard boxed by tall
wooden fences. Sonny joined him, alternatively ducking and shooting.
A round later, the toad agent slammed back against the metal panels,
groaning as the cartridge jammed. &ldquo;Cover me!!!&rdquo; He
dropped a smaller handgun from his vest. Yoshi peeked around at the
gumdrop shaped creature waddling close, lit cigar, guns carried by
invisible arms.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario was
always the weapons bearer in safaris. Consequently he rolled out to
launch a more familiar perfectly aimed egg. With a crack of the
shell, the rogue agent flipped over the next door fence. Huffin
puffins clucked in distress, drawing the attention of a chain chomp.
The horrific screams of 0088 becoming the stray&rsquo;s chew toy
began to fade in the distance.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thanks.
I didn&rsquo;t think Saleisha Koopa had pets&hellip; look I don&rsquo;t
stalk her, just say hi when I&rsquo;m at Harry's Shop&hellip; Where
she&rsquo;s assistant manager. Info she volunteered willingly so-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
spared a sympathetic glance on the youngster, his blush almost
luminous with the shadow passing over him. &ldquo;Riiight, Emerson.
Wherever you ask her out, don&rsquo;t show her those pinups you have
until at least the third date..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
dislodged dart lay in a crease of the sidewalk, Goombario carefully
studying it with the aid of a book. Mario breathed raggedly, stirring
every fifteen licks from Poochy on his palm. &ldquo;-Mr. Yoshi, long
time no see! It&rsquo;s Goombario, or paladin of the Mario Anti
Defamation League,&rdquo; boasted a young geekish goomba with square
fangs and a blue ball cap, backwards now. A touch hipper. Just a
touch. &ldquo;It dawned that I let this weekend's debacle happen to
my man, and I had to do something, being within walking distance..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
sprawled motionless in his yard garnered the attention Yoshi expected
and then some, besides the old partner, neighbors casting glances he
didn&rsquo;t like. He quietly slipped away to ask about that poison,
appalled he didn&rsquo;t the first time. When he hopped into the
backyard again, Sonny was face down in the lawn where he last saw
him. The dino dove to his side. There was no dart this time-</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I..
never.. Got. to..meet..Wendy O..&rdquo; Agent Toad coughed up blood.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
happened??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Up..
there..sir. T-too- late.. I designed Project Z with.. A..
90%..fatality rate..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
craned to the black triangular glider. A dark grey shy guy attached
to it held a contraption with a dish on the end, invisible waves from
it distorting the light purple sky and clouds. Like a bob-omb
detonated in his skull, Yoshi was hurled against the shed in agony
from head to toe.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">(Behind ya
bro! Emerson had anti-boo walls or something? Now get me out! They&rsquo;re
stealing my signature ability!!.. Yeah it&rsquo;s who you think,
sped.&rdquo; Someone violently shook the shed door from the inside.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
swiped up at the latch. The entity barged out and, offense restoring
lucidity, weird but it worked, Yoshi leapt from the ruckus of the
glider crashing through the toad agent&rsquo;s roof. The Agony ray
cracked over his head into crude handmade pieces, then more fell from
the sky that he dodged, heavy tactical boots, severed legs laced in
them, a robed torso sliced cleanly, and the final portion, all
accompanied by deep red blood splatter.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Anti-Guy&rsquo;s
disembodied head rotated mask up at, inches from his orange boot. &ldquo;I
hope the overseas forgers ruin that insolent pup..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sonny
crawled over, asking simply. &ldquo;Who got him?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
cocked his head to the side, speechless.</font></p>
<p><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Whoosh.</font></em>
&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Guess
who&rsquo;s back?&rdquo; teased a gruff, greyish purple sphere with a
short tail and sharp teeth, originating from the breached tackle box
in the shed, a tray of medical equipment balancing on the lid. Their
eyelids rose over the empty sockets. &ldquo;For an encore. The one!
The only.&rdquo; They brought their arms up, one half severed- &ldquo;
Ah, nevermind. You know who I am and I don&rsquo;t do monologues. By
the way, not cool bro.&rdquo; Zoo revealed a chunk of his head
missing, cut cleanly to the brain. &ldquo;This is why I didn&rsquo;t
give my body to science ever!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Following
a tense few seconds, the toad agent grappled the dino into a
chokehold. &ldquo;-I know, Mr. Munchakoopas. Yes I opportunistically
made that weapon. Before I was pushed into acting at Neon Heights I
studied engineering. It wasn&rsquo;t all fake though, Spy Guy had
infiltrated the mail services- looking for the patient of MY
insurance to survive in the agency until I&rsquo;m in the big league.
Think cars, vacations, women.. If the bullies don&rsquo;t kill me by
then.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
resisted the urge to snap his pale fingers in half. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
earn respect overnight either, so I&rsquo;m impressed by your
composure in the face of prejudice on the job.&rdquo; He kicked
himself up, swinging the toad over his shoulder and away where he
rolled. &ldquo;But you have much to learn. Where&rsquo;s Zoo??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Scrapping
with me while you have your little moment.&rdquo; A red boo with a
certain sleazy quality about him, decked in winter gear and needing a
shave, held onto Zoo with great difficulty.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Trevor-?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah
yeah, bet you wish it was some hot shot like Lt. Stone. Yeah no. You
get to deal with me. I hate you got rid of my poker partner 0088, but
I&rsquo;ll help you off Charles like you did Rodney if you throw next
Thursday&rsquo;s game-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Forget
that! I think your girlfriend ran into some problems on duty. There&rsquo;s
a public list of King&rsquo;s guards that are.. terminated..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo got
the slip vanishing into the shadows. M snapped to reality and
followed underground. In less than a second he came back tugging onto
a bigger boo with a gold crown, dark bags around his purple glowing
eyes from jet lag, holding a full martini glass he dumped into the
grass quickly. &ldquo;Peon, let me go immediately! Like it&rsquo;s
not enough I lost my casino and I&rsquo;m homeless and my bank is
closed on Sunday!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">King Boo
poofing away, M brought up a pale green white haired and mustached
boo. As irate, he whacked the agent with the shopping bags he&rsquo;d
carried. &ldquo;Hmph. Don&rsquo;t you dare interrupt my errands for
the Lady!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">M tried
one last time. &ldquo;-I&rsquo;ll get in so much trouble if I don't
complete community service!&rdquo; Boo E. Diddley, his neighbor in
Forever Forest, had a dull axe and a construction helmet worn down
low, the struggle making it fall off.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo?
Oh stars..&rdquo; Yoshi trailed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The toad
agent barged ahead, shaking the red boo.&ldquo;-Why can&rsquo;t you
find him?!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dude
I can&rsquo;t.. Focus enough. What the heck happened to Bridget??&rdquo;
M screamed back. When the toad hesitated, the red boo unleashed a cry
and beat him across the head with Anti-Guy&rsquo;s bamboo dart rod,
breaking it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sonny held
his jaw. &ldquo;Okay! Boo or Booigi did it!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Agent M
whipped over as Boo took the arm of the dinosaur, frozen from what
he&rsquo;d encountered in the middle of Boo&rsquo;s forehead. &ldquo;Sorry.
I&rsquo;ll..handle this..&rdquo; they slowly lead the citizen from
the scene.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Good
thing. There was someone hiding among the hedges, lacking the
inherent stealthiness of a boo, though rivaling in talent. The agents
weren&rsquo;t sure how they missed it. It was bright gold.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lord
Bowser, I insist these will sooth you. I borrowed it from Kammy.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
flicked the tiny sloshing bottle aside. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s never
soothed, gramps.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">..Good
point.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Anyway,
I gotta call it a day on page five it is... Hey, how the heck does
anybody stare at screens for eight or nine hours??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kamek
scuttled to retrieve the eyedrops. &ldquo;Tolerance and not setting
the brightness to 120 percent, my lord. I am sure your computer aided
proclamation is delightfully wicked the same..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Duh!
You think I&rsquo;m some kinda-YOW!&rdquo; His back cracked when he
lifted off that office chair. &ldquo;Just.. Here! Double check I hit
the floppy thingy.&rdquo; Half mangling the cables, Bowser tore the
laptop off his desk, the ray from screen brightness bashing the
magikoopa through the door, walls and out of the castle from the O on
the BOWSER logo. Bowser blindly stepped a portion of the hole made,
plummeting floors down. A rainbow haired koopaling flipped in his
chair as his father mashed all his art supplies..</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">OMG.
King Dad, umm-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
growled, facing the direction of the voices. &ldquo;Why are you doing
here?!?&rdquo; He hopped up in the Koopa Troop computer lab, kicking
aside the plastic playskool table as he pressed the map previously
stuck to his plastron to his face. The printers lined against the
wall were steadily spitting out photocopies too. &ldquo;Were you
trying to sneak into the city???&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Roy jumped
between them. &ldquo;Dad, it&rsquo;s on me. Dere&rsquo;s dis concert
tonite &lsquo;n-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-We
were gonna sell bootlegs on the street. Cha-Ching!&rdquo; Larry added
on the side.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">In
addition to that I, myself, Morton Jr would use my cacophonic pleas
to divert us to the shopping mall to buy the new Air Koopa sneakers
promoted by the rapper-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy
suddenly phased in. &ldquo;And then I, Super Mercenary Iggy Delta
with my ability to translate any lyric into Japanese on the spot-&rdquo;
He checked his smartphone after it played a sound effect. &ldquo;-Oh
geez.. Okay, BRB guys. Gotta enforce copyright right now.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
Junior wandered into the wispy spot he dematerialized from, pulling
along his toy train. &ldquo;Do I get to make an excuse?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Everybody,
you ain&rsquo;t in trouble!&rdquo; Bowser roared. &ldquo;In my
dedication to being the best ever, I can&rsquo;t see crap, so I need
help getting around. Wendy&rsquo;s locked up. Now where&rsquo;s
Ludwig?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Not liking
that silence, Bowser banged on a thin unmarked door, no opportunity
for customization from anyone. It didn&rsquo;t matter in this case,
the bass keys from a piano rumbling the walls..</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Vater..&rdquo;
Severe dry sounding coughing followed. The Koopa King&rsquo;s gut was
wrenched. His big plans relied on this one. &ldquo;Leave me here.&rdquo;
Cough. &ldquo;The others will lead you to the penitentiary&hellip; No
one will stray along the way, I swear!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
almost smelt a machination- but his commander would never, not in his
ill health and not after all the trouble the last one caused. Eased
he blindly stumbled off, giving someone a call. It didn&rsquo;t go
through at all. Now where would Mario be where his phone was
completely shut off?</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
couldn&rsquo;t believe he only saw it then. The green toad instructor
was mature, dressed so crisply it was intimidating. Following
Mushroom Enquirer fame the journalist went under his actual Mitch J
Toad, but back in the day, he was &lsquo;Weegee&rsquo;, the nickname
derived from his glassy piercing gaze and impressive if pedantic
ways. All for the better. Such a person should never be conflated
with Luigi.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Psst!&rdquo;
Mario ducked behind a propped up text book in the adjacent school
desk, passing a wrinkly copy paper.</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Who&rsquo;s
your special one?&rsquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
replied with the truth, slyly, also adding, &lsquo;Is your&rsquo;s
Bowser?&rsquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario&rsquo;s
initial reaction to smile brightened the dino&rsquo;s day. Then-</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No,
Yosh.&rsquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi read
it and passed it back, at a loss.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario&rsquo;s
pen poked the page for a moment, the instructor droning on. &lsquo;If
they say you only get one, how have I had multiple? If I&rsquo;m
missing something I need to be sure before I get into that mode of
thinking, especially with &lsquo;You Know Who.&rsquo; Another pause.
&lsquo;I guess Luigi was always braver than me in that area, because
dating wise-&rsquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
teacher seized the paper from under the plumber&rsquo;s nose.
&ldquo;Lesson&rsquo;s over dudes! Get ready for the 69th Annual Quirk
Quiz!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The class
setting broke apart in puzzle pieces, transforming into a purple
walled gameshow room, one side entirely blaring colorful bulbs. It
was so smoldering it was almost unbreathable, likely from that. A
seated audience consisting of creepy zeostars and starslaps, old
&lsquo;Weegee&rsquo; took the mic from the stand.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thanks
for being my third and fourth contestants ever. Get three questions
wrong and </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I..will..consume..you..</font></em>&rdquo;
<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">As shuffled
his cards, the audience heckled. &ldquo;What are the two most
deceitful things in the universe, often working in tangent?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
double X-Yux?&rdquo; Yoshi answered.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wrong!
It&rsquo;s &hellip;Alright, half a point, but the answer was &lsquo;humans&rsquo;
and &lsquo;toads&rsquo;...&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The next
question asked for the combined total of fifteen random items found
around town. Yoshi shopped online exclusively, out of the loop, and
Mario hadn&rsquo;t needed to shop much with the dowry of his heroic
services. When they guessed an x from the bulbs painted the room in
red. Pettily, that counted as two wrong answers.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Next,
is there a such thing as a toad hybrid?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
scratched his beard. &ldquo;Sure?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...Correct,&rdquo;
he muttered, the crowd booing. &ldquo;Moving on..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Under
that, Yoshi thought he saw a seam line near the audience, but before
he made a egg roll over-</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-What
is hidden in here?&rdquo; the host giggled at his cards.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
fabulous prize?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mitch
slung the mic stand out of his way. &ldquo;WRONG, Mario. I knew this
would happen to you without an intrepid partner in your ear. You&rsquo;ve
never really had to try, have you? Well now you can try as you may-
it won&rsquo;t matter!&rdquo; He trudged closer diabolically,
shoulders hunched.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That&rsquo;s
asinine Mitch. Like I&rsquo;m not always working!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah,
kickboxing, running, jumping, so innate and brainless you
disassociated ages ago and your so called close friends barely
noticed! Tell me, when exactly did you empty Curtis Mario out to
become the vessel the town could inundate with their love- or these
days, their hate?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario was
backed against the wall, clasping his head on both sides. &ldquo;It
wasn&rsquo;t- the folks here were so browbeaten from war when we
dropped in- They needed a perfect hero.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And
they got it, regardless of what this little jerk&rsquo;s
insinuating.&rdquo; Yoshi punched the journalist straight across the
face, taking care to wrinkle his clothes as he pulled him back up.
&ldquo;Check your four o clock, Mario!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario&rsquo;s
felt around for the indentation of the exit when evil stars from the
stands piled over the heroes. The pressure forced them through the
floor into roaring blue flames underneath. Everything burned,
maniacal laughter in the background as the exit panel was knocked out
by a previous contestant.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">If
you hear me, none of this is happening! It&rsquo;s all because I lost
the game. Not &lsquo;that&rsquo; game. Or do people still play The
Game? -Sorry. I can&rsquo;t help trapping people into phantom zones.
Yoshi, I can save you but Mario..&rdquo; Boo Diddley went blank. &quot;Oh
no. A bad guy, is about to take Camoztar and-!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mitch
crawled from under the pileup primal like, eyes flashing yellow.
&ldquo;Enough jabbering kid. If I&rsquo;m so darn reprehensible, find
me right now in the real world. Punish me.&rdquo;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He was in
the middle of cleaning dishes from an evening lunch. At least he&rsquo;d
remembered to eat this time. &ldquo;-Oh, early?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The trench
coat and fedora wearing guest shuffled into the adjoining, usually
closed-off room.<br/>
&ldquo;The princess wanted a single alteration,
Russ. You know efficiency is my forte. Ha.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The latest
addition to the usual maps tacked up and filled shelves was the large
banner from the last Mario Kart, draped in a temporary way, as
vibrant as the spines of the game books Russ read for leisure.
Contemplating their sessions with the conquest focused games gave him
a pinch of bliss until he encountered the coffee table, labeled and
arranged lapis lazuli bust pieces of &lsquo;Bowser&rsquo;s Brother&rsquo;
covering it. He rotated the gold ring around his index finger, wedged
in place..</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
know. Can we discuss something else?&rdquo; The blue toad leaned
against the doorway.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The seven
foot tall, red curly haired dragon koopa dropped on the couch. Russ
powered down the computer and slid in a chair on the way, stalling
unambiguously. He joined X on the tiny portion available, resting his
hand lightly on the leg the koopa crossed. &ldquo;Would you be the X
that is a contender for mayor?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mr. X
finally released some of that tension. &ldquo;Stars, ha hah., not
necessarily!&rdquo; He explained Mayor Koton&rsquo;s past as a thwimp
in King Morton&rsquo;s castle and how an ambassador tipped him on the
rampant toad slave labor. Russ was bewildered by how chaotic and
spontaneous it sounded from the most restrained person he knew, X
never intending to show up so any old joe could claim to be &lsquo;X&rsquo;
and usurp the thwimp. Did X have another friend now? Who had gotten
to him?</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The toad
let go of his cold scales with some embarrassment, sliding up his
glasses. &ldquo;So. Ah hem.. What story shall I give Mario about-? &rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Don&rsquo;t
tell him anything! Honestly this Mario and Bowser thing I keep
hearing about is&hellip; It has nothing to do with me.&rdquo;
Standing, he clasped his claws contemplatively. &ldquo;-As that
second expert I can call and inform him there&rsquo;s nothing more to
learn. Happy?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Russ stood
up to him, dwarfed. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Enough,
Russ! No one would ever understand my journey!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
did, Clarentine.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Following
the utterance of his name, Mr. X stared down at the blue spotted
toad, paralyzed. Of course he knew he knew, but- a bell went off.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">..Russ
T, it&rsquo;s Goombario. Quickly, does this Blue Falcon belong to
you? Some mask-wearing guy..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">X&rsquo;s
ears perked from an alcove in the back. He lifted a curtain as the
golden masked person hijacked it, stuffing a human inside. X burst
outside, flailing after his nitro fueled gift to himself, splurged on
less than a year ago. It hit zero to five-hundred, out of the block
in one second. Mr. X dropped to his knees in the middle of the road,
fedora and coat, missing, sweat beads rolling from his bumpy
forehead, down his snout.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Blue
koopa sir!&rdquo; Goombario had a novelty four person bike, a very
woozy dinosaur with a head bandage and an alert dog taking the slack
in the other positions. &ldquo;Yes, that was Mario getting kidnapped.
We can&rsquo;t let him get slandered again!&rdquo;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">EEeeeeeeeeeeek!&rdquo;
Toadette squeezed the daylights out of- She blinked again. It was
herself.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daze,
you cool?&rdquo; The other Toadette repeated, accidentally twirling
her dress. &ldquo;..This isn&rsquo;t my style?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Because
you&rsquo;re me, Toadette Kinopiko!&rdquo; replied &lsquo;Daisy&rsquo;.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And
I&rsquo;m you. Me. Daisy,&rdquo; said Bucken-Berry&rsquo;s body.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Every
sensation was different, from the way feet fit in shoes, to
proportions, skin color, center of gravity, weight and texture of
hair. Compounding it all, they were abducted into a half lab, half
kitschy furniture and orange shag carpet adorned spaceship.</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bucken-Berry&rsquo;
got his bearings. &ldquo;Guess what, I&rsquo;ve had x-ray vision
since yesterday so I ain&rsquo;t seeing nothing new far as Toads go.
All I wanted was to see the professor. Not that one tho.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
removed some bulky headphones that kept him oblivious mostly, using
the lab table to roll out blue prints, the corners weighed down by
his phone or wallet or pda. &ldquo;Ahhhhh!.. I mean hello again.
Forgive me, I was finalizing designs for the new Pipe Land facility.
We&rsquo;ll be 6555 miles closer than the Special World branch and I
know that is especially pertinent to you, Bucken-Berry.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bucken-Berry&rsquo;
wandered over awkwardly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll be.
Where&rsquo;s the professor?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Which
one? John Topper, professor of behavior? You know he was pivotal
when&hellip; Or you refer to Morris who majors in everything, making
him so dangerous.. Of course..&rdquo; and on he blabbered with
anecdotes of his much older friends, occasionally tugging on the blue
toad&rsquo;s plaid baggy sleeve.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bucken-Berry,
the real one watching in Toadette&rsquo;s form, already knew that
Drew wasn&rsquo;t very shy at all in the right circumstance, however
the real Toadette in Daisy's body was dying inside, bronze skin as
fair as the toads. Okay, it was funky to see &lsquo;himself&rsquo;
with someone else, and this was some comeuppance for her error, but
it went no further. He lacked the capacity to be with anyone right
now, something they&rsquo;d need to sit and talk about-</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
is this? Cease that frolicking, Drew!!!&rdquo; Dr. toad gawked at
Prof. X-Naut, continuing, &ldquo;- First John used my secret project
to teleport around those farm entities-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">To
make them comfortable with the cold weather,&rdquo; the green hammer
bro defended.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Whatever,
and now you use it to gather groupies? Get them out! I copied the
teleporter from *classified* to locate and retrieve my MacGuffin, an
inanimate object! I cannot be sued for any other side effects.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dawg,
wait!&rdquo; &lsquo;Bucken-Berry&rsquo; called before they got pushed
into an exit shoot. &ldquo;Could we reverse something with your time
machine?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Prof.
X-Naut retrieved from a drawer a web covered, analog character clock
ticking in a weak metallic way. The Sarasalandian princess discovered
it previously with the Hiyoihoi, and no she didn&rsquo;t do that
damage. &ldquo;That IS the MacGuffin, young man. The only safe way to
escape a Red Chomp is to open a temporal portal, alas, no, you cannot
resolve some relationship matter with it..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sorry
guys, Morris holds the belief that love is a fraud,&rdquo; Dr. T
chipped in from a yoga mat in the corner.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The space
alien shook more screws from it, ranting, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you shut
me up from exposing the ignis fatuus of the entertainment industry!
&lsquo;Crazy in Love&rsquo; is not just a hit from Beanyonce.. The
real explanation is that If I repair it, a future version of myself
called &lsquo;Sirrom&rsquo; will appear and smash it to bits with a
sledgehammer.&rdquo; He shrugged and when his mitten was in the air
somewhat, someone warped inside the ship and retrained it, like a
sleek maneuver from Snifit Patrol, except failing when the handcuffs
were too small for the x-naut. (He was sure the alien was about
Kammy&rsquo;s size. Apparently not.)</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
never as cool as it looks in your head.&rdquo; Iggy grumbled.
Resetting the intro, he slipped into his work uniform vivaciously
announcing, &ldquo;Iggy Delta of Nerd Squad here. Ready to fix-&ldquo;
He unsheathed the Beam Sword 8000. &ldquo;-Your faces for stealing my
Transporter-To-Convenient-Plotpoint-Location DLC!!&rdquo; He slashed
random things in half.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">In the
panic, Dr. Toad was sure to gather his plans. Only one person could
keep all his work from going down the drain, and from a sensation on
the back of his neck, a sibling connection, he knew he was in town
for an encore.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The driver
visited every tile of the map, avoiding tire bursting pokies, violent
tweesters, and headwear stealing kleptos. The tour was sold out and
myths were shared at points of interest, though none as grand as
this:</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~Once upon
a time, patooie plant engineer was framed for mauling a guy while.
The Tostarena Town officers conscripted him for hard labor, during
which he secretly worked on a Mecha-Yoshi prototype, loosely based on
the mysterious Jaxi. He burst out and rode into the sunset until
settling in the podunk down in Southern Mushroom Kingdom!</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jr.
Troopa&rsquo;s story for the dueling yoshi and hammer bro sphinx: the
wide spot between them was definitely where an ancient civilization
held sports games, the sphinx being the mascots. Camera flashes
showered some nearby ruins, purportedly the afterparty zone. That
would explain why they were so deteriorated after all. Wait, since
when did he care? He had to get through the desert every day to get
to work. Oh right. The South was frigid, but weather was more mild
than ever recorded in Dry Dry Desert. He didn&rsquo;t get it, as
Tutankoopa&rsquo;s tomb rolled up. Huge as the stadium in Toad Town,
intricate stone work wrapped about the structure, a mere velvet rope
blocking the blue torch lit passageway with hieroglyphs. He wanted to
avoid the bottle neck out of the vehicle. That wouldn&rsquo;t be an
issue for another reason-</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Why
litter, mon ami?&rdquo; The driver waggled an empty syringe bag, one
of many.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The mildly
oafish King&rsquo;s guard, one of many spotted around, shook his head
in the face of the restless tourists. &ldquo;Not our doing. We were
in Area 64 and then it became so chilly this afternoon we-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Don't
squeal!!&rdquo; Another ran up. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re this close to
being the one we send solo to carry water from the oasis.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Give
Reginald credit. He refrained from mentioning the part where you plan
on leaving your fallen comrades' bodies in there. Or how you&rsquo;ve
formed an independent boo-hunting faction.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Reginald
aimed his super scope, belatedly noting the shellfish creature had
already aimed his silenced pistol first, above the belt. Five
proximate guards drew their weapons in various states of wear and
disrepair, tourists dispersing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jr. Troopa
eagerly crouched under the van chassis, gaining more of a view than
he bargained for. A chestnut horse and a speckled chicken, two
recently missing animals of Bob the bob-omb buddy were in the
backdrop, strolling aimlessly in the tomb. The librarian had been
locked in a chest yesterday due to, quote: &lsquo;Jefe del Escuadr&oacute;n
Toad&rsquo;.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He whacked
his head on the axel. &ldquo;Buck-Wilde! Col-Turkey! Get outta
there!!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Their
commotion of trampling cedar boxes gave the noki the distraction
needed to check his dive watch, smooth sweeping seconds hand striking
the twelve. At the moment he divined, the two animals rounded
outside, leaping over the velvet rope, knocking over the closest
guards with the gun, then over the noki&rsquo;s head. Troopa was
picked- or nipped by Buck-Wilde like a chicken and kicked in the face
by the scrawny thin legs of Col-Turkey like she was some horse. The
belligerent livestock slung him away as sand shook from the crevices
of the temple. The ground rumbled from a horde of gauze wrapped
toads, Mummy-Mes. They cleaned out any stragglers while Noki pulled
the last person lingering aside, a tourist left behind from the last
tour.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Tu
es magnifique mon amour,&rdquo; Agent 0064 toyed, wrestling with him.
It wasn&rsquo;t much of a fight with the toad unable to move his
lower half of his body. &ldquo;At least you discovered the
revitalizing properties and not the blast this beautiful landmark
away ones. How did you find Nitro Honey Syrup?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Like
I&rsquo;d tell you, handsome. Ha, even when you haven&rsquo;t slept
in two days. Kinda impressive. Too bad your Jeremy can&rsquo;t
appreciate that anymore.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jelectro
dropped Mitch flat, growling, &ldquo;You boo minion lobotomized my
civil partner, Mitch&hellip; Agent N is in the hospital and I cannot
even visit him or his niece Ashley without compromising.. Ahg!&rdquo;
(Like a mini twisted therapy session, THAT unearthed.. No wonder he
was sloppy now. The noki could only down so many pills to stick in
the game..)</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mitch
calculatingly watched him tremble. &ldquo;Boo is still a decent
channeller on occasion, though I learned real quick it&rsquo;s better
to rely all on myself. I&rsquo;d say sorry but you can read my- Oh
you can&rsquo;t right. Darn. Shoulda made myself look better by
saying sorry- ha ha.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The noki
lashed out before he could stop it, kicking him in the gut. &ldquo;What
else do you know?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mitch
winched for a bit, then smiled through it. &ldquo;Too bad you didn&rsquo;t
break something.. There&rsquo;s a reason why I let you detect me. Why
I let her find me.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The black
Lexus launched off a dune, pulling up as he slid to the ground.
Twisting around, the noki wished he was a boo about then.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Get
in! Your Aston Mushroom&rsquo;s still safe in my driveway, Bond. As
for that ol Mitch. Yeah, let&rsquo;s take him too.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You&rsquo;d
better. That&rsquo;s my new car..&rdquo; he said, Kylie roughly
hauling him in the back seat.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hush.
As an enemy of the Kingdom, enjoy those heated leather seats one last
time. Everything you&rsquo;ve done is recorded, so if you hate toads
so much we&rsquo;ll ship you away from their town!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jelectro
slid his shades down, evidence blaring of forced entry, scratches and
bent fiberglass on the driver door. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t use pet names
from arch nemeses of mine, madam. Besides, arrest first, write book
reports later. Mitch is willing to destroy himself for whatever he is
yearning for.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yikes.&rdquo;
She cupped over her mouth. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just get to goin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
Unable to be as cruel as she wished, she took along and folded up his
wheelchair, cut off by the agent from the drivers seat. He wanted to
see something curious inside, a spectrum analyzer-like device crudely
yanked from one car, to be haphazardly taped to the center console.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The pink
shelled koopa reluctantly climbed in shotgun then. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
Dr. Houdini Toadley&rsquo;s Psycho Radar that.. I&rsquo;ll tell you
more later. It&rsquo;s too muggy to breathe.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Indeed..&rdquo;
He sped in the desert with the reporters. &ldquo;Did the bus accident
break both of his legs?&rdquo; he asked, as if he wasn&rsquo;t right
behind them.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Uh.&rdquo;
She turned to him anxiously. &ldquo;No. Just head trauma, spinal
issues.. Yep. Definitely. I saw.. And signed his papers..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hm.
Well they are both broken now and if you remove his shoes, aside from
smelly socks, you will find no toes left. Most severed by cutting, a
few by blunt twisting motion, one gnawed..&rdquo;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
was quick,&rdquo; remarked the Spindel, nearly the width of the room
as he stared her down.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
koopaling flipped through the packet another time for show. &ldquo;Imma
quick reader. Trust me..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Afterwards,
Wendy shivered on the Darklandian crest rug waiting for that final
confirmation of being out of the running, the record lows frosting up
the glass, clouding the rest of Neo Bowser City. Some Skylandians
were hanging about in support for that lame Mr. Toad, but her worries
were more with the Mayor Koton clan, thwomps guarding each door,
malice radiating from each she encountered. They understood she was
being forced didn&rsquo;t they? By the time she got her okay, she was
glad to leave the fortress that touched the poisonous clouds. Flat
footed without her heels she made the trek down the icy path alone
meeting her family and troop at the fortress stone gates.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yes,
sir! We disembark!&rdquo; Tanner saluted.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Seriously?-
I mean yes sir..&rdquo; Perfunctory, Emery echoed, followed by
Johnson and Hippity-Hop the last of her hot pink outfitted
&lsquo;disciples&rsquo; officially rejoining the Koopa Troop they
never really left.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Done,

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wendy
rolled her eyes at her dad.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Why

up when we&rsquo;re home! Let&rsquo;s go go go!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">While they
crouched into the waiting limo on one side, it was so expensive and
roomy with multiple compartments, purposely chosen by Larry who knew
what singers and celebrities preferred, that Lemmy, Roy, Morton,
Larry, and Junior by accident snuck out, without notice. Well, too
late to tell the six year old to stay home with papa now. Neo Bowser
City had no speed limits and it was out of there.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy&rsquo;s
tentative deep breath fogged up his hand made map. It was do or die
to circumvent Skylandians, Koton&rsquo;s supporters, and whatever
else awaited between them and the mayor&rsquo;s office. He kept
trying to contact Iggy, going straight to voicemail. His absence was
going to sting like the ice water hitting his cold blooded body. As
koopa kids comradery was effortless, then they just had to grow up
and it get weird. Getting stuck in an ignore each other cycle was as
frightening as the static ghastly Tox Boxes resting on raised </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">sloping
altars</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">.
They passed them while journeying through the bramble filled
courtyard. It became apparent the entire building leaned some. Lemmy
didn&rsquo;t plan for that, nor the security system that greeted them
at the thick heavy entrance doors. Larry couldn&rsquo;t find usb
access to hack the terminal, nor could Morton and Roy brute force it
with a giant hammer and bill cannon respectively. Junior continued to
play in the background, ignored.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy,
you gotta contribute man. Do we crack the code? Jimmy the lock? Ring
the buzzer and ask politely?&rdquo; Morton tapped his brother&rsquo;s
head..</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
startled rainbow haired koopaling lost balance with the ball. He had
to think positively. They could do it. And prioritize. Deal with
interpersonal stuff later, now would endanger the world. With that he
could perk right up. &ldquo;Like, not that last one! We don't do
anything nice, hello?&rdquo; He waved around the scepter with the
perfect thing in mind when there was a loud screech of metal against
rock.</font></p>

random to her, but she supposed she happened to be in the one castle
chamber with a fax machine for a reason, folding it to consider
later. In solitude, the princess basked in the warmth of the sun
through the magenta, orange, and blue stained glass before it was
back to weightier matters. She tried to get through to Daisy during
the moment she had to spare, hearing her voicemail for the first
time. It was recently recorded too, because if older than a year it
would have predated the sinus surgery she'd gotten, and also at the
discretion of some official. Stating credentials formally, without
slang, she couldn't suppress her cockney accent very much. Present or

blimp engulfed the lot of Royal Raceway. Poshley guards let King
Elderberry Toadstool out, tall, blockish head accented by a black and
gold mushroom shaped crown, the sides extending to the sideburns of
his dyed black beard. Diamonds twinkle from his ear lobes and
matching rings near his thick knuckles, no other adornments. The
moment his cog hit the pavement and he removed round shaded glasses
from his aquiline nose, he thought he was boss, in his lounging look
to make his daughter look foolish for overdressing comparatively.
Wrong father, she hissed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Chef
Timothy had five grills smoking from Giga-carrot in the rec area of
the track. The King shut the covers and apprehended the cook too
late, the aroma of his most despised food permeating castle grounds.
It was totally forgotten then. A purple toad careened into the
caravan with a clarinet, performing until the King plugged his ears
and a guard made the Lester choke on the woodwind. The next setback
was less hands on, but all the more calamitous. When Joseph applied,
he assured Peach he could do anything any other toad could except
hear. That was an undersell. He irrigate everything. Muddy here,
nipper plants thriving there. King had to put up with a slow narrow
windy path or get soiled- no other options! He tapped his foot
halfway at a rock in the way, too heavy for guards to move.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">How
am I. To get. Across this?!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Touch
grass!&rdquo; she called down from the cannon.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
am! I left my palace. At your request. Did I not?&rdquo; He cut
across the weeds dirt patches to be upon her in moments, mockingly
amiable. &ldquo;Lovely decor. My daughter. Also I can see. How the
Earl won that. Silver, Thursday.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A L emblem
kart flew off the rainbow dropping from the clouds. Peach and most of
the guards and nobles braced for the big splash in the moat. Made of
cardboard it floated to the top again with the occupants. Luigi and
Toad swam out, dazed as Peach ran over and hugged them like mad.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Show
him your parcel and get em outta here,&rdquo; Toad advised, quietly.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another emergency going on and-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Grinning
impishly, The King let a long scroll unroll. Peach about launched to
the second moon in the sky. </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">How
did he get it?</font></em> &ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
are done father, done?&rdquo; He read back. &ldquo;You will cease
infusing your wicked ideas in other lands. I beseech you to dissolve
your reign and live the rest of your days HERE under my supervision,
lest I ruin you? I am losing control of my institutions. I am losing
Mario. I have little left, so I am more than willing to go back on my
promise???&rdquo; He let it float gently to the driveway, whisking
around in the air a scepter next.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A ball of
light lifted over stunned faces and settled on an empty green plot,
many acres wide, adjacent to castle grounds and the racetrack. The
yard sparkled.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">My
daughter, I promised I&rsquo;d not be a pain in your neck. I can go
back on that too. You will be one under MY supervision!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
picked his jaw up. &ldquo;Elderberry, that&rsquo;s mine already! I
was never scratched off the paperwork.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">This
family. Earl?&rdquo; The King stepped to the side and clones of Mr.
Toad, down to the lack of gender indicators, absent entirely on toads
of that pedigree, arrived from the leisure route.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">While
their black and gold robes matched the King, their demeanor differed,
skittishly ogling everything, including their long lost descendant.
His eldest sibling, the Duke spoke up.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Earl,
we only wish we could rewind our drastic reaction to your behavior.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
fought against the jellification of his legs, &ldquo;Y-yeah I
figured. Hey just- over here- uh please.&rdquo; He motioned to be
followed around the castle some.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There
was much pressure from the King, allies, other lofty ones,&rdquo;
Duke elaborated, other Toads nodding as they trailed the two leading
aristocrats. &ldquo;Forgive us.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mr. Toad
kept his hands in his soggy pockets as they approached a barricade of
downed trees. Since the Pillar of Understanding incident, the erosion
of the hills made it impossible to reach the back yard that way and
he knew that, hitting a dead-end mentally as physically.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Look,
you left me in a bad place. I somehow picked myself up and I forgive
you, for my own sanity at least, but I just don&rsquo;t get it..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
were devastated!&rdquo; They exclaimed. &ldquo;</font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We</font></em>
<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">are a line
with .0001% variance. You were given the name Toad to be the paragon
of us folks, Earl.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mr. Toad
sighed out years of frustration, his family flinching when he swung
around from the foliage. &ldquo;Nature managed to carve out a &lsquo;freak&rsquo;
like me that&rsquo;s attracted to humans, males, despite me being
ostensibly so, with a crush on one in particular with a mustache- oh
and two first names. Deal with it. You can selectively breed to make
us look as identical as you want but you can&rsquo;t regulate our
personalities, behaviors, and preferences like that. That just makes
you an ass-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Something
blew the heck up, so close, their ears rang. As pine cones and bits
of bark rattled from the blast rain over them, Toad rose first, his
blanched face glowing from orange flames.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Frantic
guards scuttled downhill to Royal Raceway, the blimp on fire. Luigi&rsquo;s
kart, or the one the Vrlrdyi Scope conjured, had drifted downstream
where the C-4 was triggered from ambers of Tim&rsquo;s fiery grills.
Precisely why one does not totally ignore such.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">At the
castle, &ldquo;-Father.. Since your stay will be extended after all.
Let&rsquo;s take a stroll around Star Hill. Alone.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The King
cocked one eyebrow, infuriatingly impervious to the chaos.. &ldquo; I
oblige.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Up
here, urgently,&rdquo; came from a room on the mezzanine, where&rsquo;d
Toadsworth had been all along it seemed. He unquestionably missed
nothing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad, in a
new change of clothes, steeled himself for the lashing, tapping on
the door. &ldquo;K. Right here, Toadsworth.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">If
you did not pull that stunt, why, I would have tossed some dynamite
myself, good chap!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
were a bomber in the war weren&rsquo;t you? &rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Worked
close with the Paragoomba infantry, up until they deserted. ...Master
Toad, Master Luigi is exemplary, only heed that someone of your
hierarchy has not chosen an unorthodox suitor since Princess Mush IV.
You may have boarded the infamous </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Difficulties
Ahead</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">,
but you can handle it, I am equally certain.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
silently thanked the stars. The general reaction from staff of &lsquo;okay
whatever bro&rsquo; to everything he unfettered all he ever wanted.
They were going to have to kick the housekeeping up a notch though,
the lobby only marginally cleaned up from when Mr. Zeror used a
jackhammer (sounded epic, which he could have seen it) to break into
the basement.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">..Don&rsquo;t
cry, it&rsquo;s&hellip;Quite alright. You will be an excellent
chancellor.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
feared that's what that eye burning sensation was as he stared at his
reflection in the polished checkerboard tiles. &ldquo;Thanks&hellip;
Now. Did anyone take the furniture out of that secret slide room?
You&rsquo;ve been echoing like crazy&hellip;Sam? &rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He dared
press into the pitch black room, a strong sour musk within. He
smacked the light switch. The olive green throw Toadsworth was known
to snuggle with had a lump under it, deep in the room the three
stained glass panels watching over.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
ripped the cover from the moldy, brown spotted, curled, white haired
toad, dry for some time. He staggered back, tripping over himself.
&ldquo;Stars! What happened to you Samuel??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Master
Toad.. Tell no one of my body. The Jewel of the Stars, the
Toadstool&rsquo;s tool to puppet toads for centuries, was right here
in our basement until a friend became a Judas!&rdquo; the disembodied
voice cried. &ldquo;Strike him down and retrieve it before the Jewel
of Stars meets its rival, the other Jewel of Stars!&rdquo;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
squawking goonies drove the snaggle toothed officer up a wall. Not a
Pushy-Wall or 'Bomp', a relative to whomps like him, a.. Never mind.
Mid day Water Land was plagued with goop, unpredictable tides
endangering land dwellers. It was rumored that Ice Land was melting,
though he hardly gave attention to that when he was busy with local
reports of property damage and injuries. Being of Snifit Patrol, not
the Sumeet Snufit himself, his executive decision was to delay
tedious paperwork that didn't ever help anyone. Reading a wooden sign
in kanji, arrows spanning four ways, he righted it, uncovering a
missed goop splotch.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sergeant
Howie whistled for one of the orange jumpsuited inmates. The toad
obsequiously hosed around with the dubious 'F.L.A.U.D.' (Flash
Longitudinally Articulating Utility Drencher) on his back, no Gadd
seal of approval on it to be found. The onerous clean up was up to
the imitations, what the other toads were using when Yellow Toad
rejoined them, spraying water in neat lines over where the beach and
deep jungle greens intertwined.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Can
we discuss the Elle in the room? Aside from us being convicts,&quot;
Yellow spoke up.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The Toad
Brigade met in a shady spot willingly, if skeptically, by The
Captain's folding arms.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Bill,
we know Stan is your father's youngest brother of nine and you
weren't introduced until the Berlin Byways fell in your adulthood.
What I'm asking.. why are you so close to him that... I mean, why do
you allow him to profit from your impulse disorder?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Banktoad
jolted like he was spat, or sprayed in the face. &quot;J&ouml;rg,
come on. If you're Mr. Psychic you know I was kicked out of home. I
would have dropped out of school if Stanley and I didn't meet. I told
him 'look I'm messed up'. I do stuff like this subconsciously..&quot;
They gawked when the green toad materialized a heavy set of gold keys
to a boat. &quot;And he was like-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;William,
you are the best!&quot; The Captain unstrapped his FLAUD, holding
them high over his head as he beamed at his nephew. &quot;Let us
depart and find the Darklandian Jewel of the Stars.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Excuse
me.. Um. I don't mean to give severance - I mean I promised to assist
Parakarry tackle the holiday rush, but aside from that I like the
ideal of this job, I just don't think how we're going about it is-
uh, right.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
Captain froze, vexingly. &quot;Pardon?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The purple
toad lifted his focus from his sand caked boots, boring into him with
the faintest of embers. &quot;I.. well I did stutter, but you
understood! I will not be a disgrace, not professionally nor in our-
or my old community. Zechariah was heartbroken when he heard about
us, you know, my mission partner back there-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Ah.
So it's religion, the same reason Miss Toadette had to fill in for
you once.&quot; The Captain airily swung the keys around his finger.
&quot;Do you know what you two have in common?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Captain,
Mail's eleemosynary and proselytizing work aside, even I agree that
taking a recess for treasure would be unwise!&quot; Hint argued.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Two
foot, three inch difference, identical BMI,&quot; The Captain
chuckled. &quot;That's all I was going to say. I know because I
touched them... And by touching Heinemann, or specifically the
Lexicon pdf on his phone, but yes his body too I suppose, I know that
the treasure in Dark Land is the key to unlimited, world changing
power-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;That
you'll never get.&quot; Banktoad ripped the key from him, pocketing
it. &quot;This is because I love you. Trust me.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
devastation on their leader could only be compared to how he might
look if his accounts were wiped clean. The red toad keeled over into
some bushes, gagging. When his mini break down was over and he
whipped around, aiming an over-pressured rocket nozzle, he was only
threatening some of the brigade.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The high
tide polluted anew by shifting waters, the yellow toad on the dock
found it all futile. Another sat at the edge with him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hey.
If this brigade thing is done for, umm, you are welcome to visit
Zechariah's apiary. You wouldn't have to convert or work the bees
even, there's just have a lot of unsolved mysteries in the fringes of
Mushroom territories if you recall.&quot; He added in hush, leaning
in, &quot;They'd pay handsomely, being exempt from Kingdom taxes..&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yellow
Toad pat the purple spotted mailman's shoulder, getting in return a
rarely seen smile. &quot;My ramshackle plots so far make me hesitate
to lend my expertise, but thanks.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Why
wasn't my offer to lecture there accepted?&quot; Hint Toad stood in
the gap between them. Yellow was silently annoyed, or more annoyed
rather that 'four eyes' ruined their moment.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;They
don't need someone redolent of a dialogue box, Hint,&quot; Mail
answered patiently. &quot;Are you with us or them?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He paused.
&quot;The empath is the most elusive talent under the psychic
umbrella,&quot; Hint dodged excellently. &quot;That doesn't count as
an example and to be objective, not captious, if we've slumped this
far Yellow Toad must be insufficiently trained at it. &quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
'empath' stopped staring at oily waters, standing up. &quot;No
Heinemann, I can't lift you in the sky, make heads explode, or
anything cool, just be a voyeur to people's effed up emotions and
dreams.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;That
has to be torturing when you, uh, put it that way.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His scowl
melted, facing the mailman. &quot;It's quite scary Mordecai, though
</font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">thrilling</font></em>
<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">might be the
better word.&quot; He pointed out the cop over there. In a white and
blue hammock tied between two bowed out trees, the newspaper over
Sergeant Howie's head rippled from snoring. &quot;Watch.&quot;</font></p>
<p><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~..Sergeant
Howard Nurikabe.. 58. From Shroom City. He placed third in a national
triathlon twenty years ago! The only remaining from Snifit Patrol's
original squad, joining initially to escape the humdrum of being a
seasonal obstacle on Bowser's golf course. He actually hates Bowser.
And evil. Don't ever mistake him for a 'baddie' or think he's too old
for action. Not with someone in danger RIGHT NOW&hellip;</font></em> 
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yellow
Toad trailed, swaying as the whomp sprung off the hammock, slapped
his cap on, and barreled towards him. An orange capped toad women
convict, Nass T was struggling in the swells, and Yellow was in the
way, trampled by the cop and knocked into the murky water with a huge
splash. Mailtoad dove agilely after him, his 'Level One Snorkel-Toad
Certification' coming in handy. Just as his arm graced Yellow's, a
siren, or something with red eyes and a big finned tail slapped them
towards an activated underwater pipe, sucking up the toads. While
Hint Toad sprinted down the dock wailing for help, it went black for
the yellow and purple toads in the depths.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">In
hindsight the trip was rife with danger. At least neither of them
were rookies. Peach and Mushroom King finessed around downed trees
all the way to the jagged precipice, rewarded with a stunning view of
the kingdom and restoring soul star bits, even if reduced to the
slightest drizzle.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Side by
side, he faced her sharply. &quot;Whom were you. Engaged to?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
quietly exhaled. &quot;Like it matters now&hellip; Fine. Princess
Daisy of Sarasaland.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Ho
ho.. I approve.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Do
not humor me, father. Why, sure! And there is no possibility that
your minions are covertly following us.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Of
course not,&quot; he retorted in kind. &quot;Same for you!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The jig
up, King's guards rustled bushes stepping out, worse for wear from
being unadapted to the lower gravity. Luigi's entrance was his
bruised up body flailing in the air from the big boo that launched
him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He rolled
against the King and princess's feet, opening his bloodshot eyes.
&quot;Run!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">King Boo
pushed apart two indigo trees. His blue flames made the guards
scatter like ant-troopers under a microscope as he directed his glare
to the Toadstools. &quot;Bwa ha ha ha! Stranded in your unimpressive
city I have amassed your worst nightmare. COMMENCE MY ARMY!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Seemingly
every tree in the forest shook at once. Luigi had climbed up by then,
sputtering to Peach that his old foe had arrived a minute ago
exactly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~&ldquo;We..were..never..yours,
eh...Now &hellip;move&hellip;you&hellip;fatty!&rdquo; the hidden army
droned.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hoards of
mummy-mes were unleashed. Pummeled, Peach was pulled away from her
plumber pal, their hands gracing, just not enough. Swept forward she
couldn&rsquo;t miss the mummy toads forcing her father down the
bottomless abyss. He caught a branch, the monsters leaping into the
void to take him down with them. One spunkier than the others, landed
on his shoulders and squeezed thick his neck, strangling the mushroom
ruler until he was blue than the glow of the sacred land.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Huddled
helplessly, she desperately petitioned to the stars, sobbing,
begging, again and-</font></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
cannot make that wish, killer. You are under another contract with
us..&rdquo;</font></em> 
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~No. I
never wanted his life. Only.. to ruin his hateful influence. That is
all.. I just want him back. Please.</font></p>
<p><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Forget
the man you hate. I can get your MOTHER back-</font></em> 
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What? Her
heart just. Burst.</font></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
of a trade? Enter the depths and become the princess of the only
galaxy you deserve to rule&hellip; NO? You don&rsquo;t trust me? Ha
ha ha. You had a chance to use the wish I can furnish. Now that you
forfeit, everything will be stripped from you, including the calm of
death.&rdquo;</font></em> 
</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The next
sensation for the blond princess, she was on her side, being slid
from the edge by a human, rough enough to scrape her up some and ruin
the gown. Daisy. She made it. She finally made it. Overwhelmed she
leapt into the other princess's arms. Her father was rescued it
appeared, laying tiredly on a stretcher, guards surrounding. Some of
her toads and Luigi was there, also some mummy-mes and King Boo.. not
entirely banished but captured in various ways. Slowly, it felt like
the nightmare was ending.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yo.
I'm back baby, and as my myself! &quot; Daisy's voice was hoarse yet
riveting. &quot;Well... that won't make sense. Long story. Actually
short story: we couldn't rewind, but.. we don't need to anymore
right? Peachy?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Continuing
to peer over the other princess's shoulder, the pink slowly realized
she was never leaning on her side. Star Hill was crumbling apart with
them on it, starbits flying from the chasm. They were washed down
into town and it didn't stop there.</font></p>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Scram!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
Koopa led the scatter from the trouncing ogre faced beasts. Tripping
up, Larry found himself pinned against a sloping altar. With a crash
louder than a doomship backfiring, his world went black. He wasn&rsquo;t
smashed to smithereens but trapped either way.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Heeeeeelp!!&rdquo;
He walloped the tox box&rsquo;s interior walls. To feel better,
sorta, he remembered it was common for princes to need rescue
actually. They were vulnerable and as valuable a bargaining chip as a
princess, it only didn&rsquo;t make headlines at the request of said
distressed dudes.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...Got
ya bro!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The teen
fist pumped.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-For
five bucks.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wtf,&rdquo;
Larry grumbled.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Just
kiddin. HUHGH!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Roy pried
one side up enough for Larry to snake under with a hushed little
&lsquo;thanks&rsquo;. The lava from the fortress towers were on their
bare heels when they joined the others clanging against and shaking a
closed barbed fence.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
ordered, &ldquo;Punch it on three!.. 123! Go!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Their
combined punch flipped the fence around on the pivot, flinging the
five face first on the frigid sidewalk. Karts with ridiculously tiny
red roller wheels screeched on the street, and nightcrawlers, ninjis,
gloombas, and eeries ogled at the oozing lava show, steaming fiercely
against the continual wintry mix in the area. Under that commotion
Lemmy sprung up and shoved everyone into the across the street
mailing center subsidiary where the staff appeared to be out.
Relieved, Lemmy scratched a new number on his hand drawn watch,
surreally drawn to a crumpled holoflash present box at the top of the
iron bins around.</font></p>
<p><em>&rsquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">From:
Koopa Klaus. To: Ian Koopa&rsquo;</font></em> <font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">the
tag stated on bombsketball he&rsquo;d wished for forever ago. -Or
specifically before he dropped his non performing title.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He whipped
around as the bell rang and someone in a dark tassel coat stepped
in...</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Drats!
I mean.. We didn&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wasn&rsquo;t
born yesterday, Lem.&rdquo; She advanced out of the shadows, waltzing
around in soggy fuzzy slippers. With a mix matched purple sleeping
gown under that coat, she&rsquo;d dressed in a hurry they noticed,
and not as an insult to her for once.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wendy?&rdquo;
they chorused.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~One
and only!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sis,&rdquo;
Lemmy began, suspiciously.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">None
of this is for the lulz, okay?? The fortress is, like, gutted. Walls,
insulation, leaving only support beams after that thwomp worker left.
Koton wanted to install traps for the Sky Land toads tomorrow. I have
plenty more tips that the corporations don't want ya to know.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
rolled some quip on the back of his tongue before some DK bongos in
the unclaimed goods pile distracted him. The distaff koopaling was
thus saved from disapprobation, the rest of her brother's eyes
gleaming at free stuff. Bowser Junior found a Gaddget imitation
&lsquo;Spastic Painbrush&rsquo;, sloshing Morton&rsquo;s freshly
plucked obscure magazines. While they were chasing each other Roy
settled on a book of all things with a label taped to the cover.
(Seriously, who does that?)</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Usin'
tunin&rsquo; forks, the scientists of the dark ages determined dat
peak frequency was an indicator of &lsquo;Obiecti Specialem&rsquo;
by-&rdquo; He paused, brows scrunching. &ldquo;What are these? Lyrics
to some lame mathcore song?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wendy
twisted the cover around. &lsquo;Rocks: What they are and where to
find them'. &ldquo;Brother, it&rsquo;s a petrology textbook you are
blatantly looting. Heh, and MY business prospects are sooo debased.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wendy,
welcome aboard but don&rsquo;t say I stole because I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
Lemmy corrected, spinning the bombsketball on his finger. &ldquo;This
had my name on it.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And
this has mine!&rdquo; She grabbed an arm full of foundation in a
faded box, recalled for allergic reactions akin to the Power Balloon
treatment. This was a look folks paid for current day though, not to
mention recycled for sustainability!</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Work
that grift, queen!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Indeed,
cheat and obfuscate the ESRG for even more business funding,&rdquo;
Morton accused, finger wagging. &ldquo;You are literally worse than
those Shufflegate toads!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lunging at
Roy and Morton, Wendy slipped in Junior&rsquo;s paint, colliding into
the bins. It was like the cymbal clash to the beat Larry was tapping
at the moment.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~You
can call me L4rry, or call me king. Got 0.9144 meters, not ta be
mean!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wendy rose
from the pile, face completely powdered out as Roy and Morton hacked
with laughter. &ldquo;Disgusting and low vibrational. Stop!!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
song&rsquo;s just about those wands we used to use!&rdquo; he spat
back. &ldquo;Tho, you right. It&rsquo;s corny with conversions and
math and junk. Overhearin those night school classes is cramping my
style.&rdquo; (Roy suddenly hid the textbook behind his shell.)</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Everybody,
enough! Stop telling our sister what to do!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Roy sized
his older yet littler brother up. &ldquo;So you can tell us what ta
do?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yes.&rdquo;
Lemmy spat himself with some camouflaging dark blue paint. &ldquo;Wait
outside. Peacefully.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lava
draining down sewer grates allowed spectators and him rolling on the
bombsketball to get closer before going Koopa Jordan. Poor gift in
postal purgatory, he lamented, lining up the shot with one eye
closed. It was time to adopt the Festive Tree Day spirit in the month
of Yam and be charitable.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mr.
Steinblock appreciated the increased maneuverability from the last
minute renovations, but that unclearable until next morning molten
rock was an accelerant for trouble in the form of rubbernecking
citizens as the rugs and curtains.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Crash! A
sizzling object burst through some. As the spindel rolled away from
the reception desk, several blue ribbon wearing whomps left the
elevator too late to toss it back. Ka-boom! Adjacent buildings lost
their windows, park cars were smashed in, and the block was coated in
glass from the pancaking explosion, driving all but six of the
witnesses away.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lem,&rdquo;
Roy sputtered in the dust, patting Lemmy&rsquo;s shell. &ldquo;Ya
went Banzai bill on em! Noice!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
was only trying to blow the doors off..&rdquo; Lemmy shifted his
weight uneasily. &ldquo;Anyway.. Uh.. Search the rubble!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Just
try it kid.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Steinblock
dislodged from a portion that revealed that the entire top floor
remained intact. Thwomps and whomps gunned out for them from there or
rose from the debris piles. Roy made KoopaBall defensive and
offensive plays back to back with Morton. Larry snatched the latter&rsquo;s
dropped magazines to make ninja stars, striking down the baddies the
&lsquo;Thunder Brothers&rsquo; would soften up first. Junior&rsquo;s
brush uncontrollably spewed chocolate colored goop on all surfaces,
hindering everyone really, until Lemmy actually noticed him for once
and turned that around, blinding foes with the paint. Wendy chased
down the cylindrical creature that dared to claim she couldn&rsquo;t
read paperwork. Petty, but he was slow and easily caught. The powder
from the pallet slapped in his face made him sneeze and bang against
a leaning wall. It sent others down with and suddenly the princess
was facing into a roofless golden office. A wood panel fragment with
ghostly hints of plaques was the backdrop of Mayor Koton,
aggressively circling something in a tattered book with a nub of a
pencil.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
dropped out. Leave.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No
way.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Koton
looked up, a comparatively iridescent middle spike on his head
catching the Boo Moon light just right. &ldquo;Yes you will,
sweetheart.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
distaff koopaling understood the breadth of his power then, compelled
to leave against her will. Thank G.O. and D. Lemmy dropped in then,
interrupting his scheme by stepping over the flipped shelves to
approach the desk at eye level.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Great
job sis. So Mr. Mayor. Hi, we&rsquo;re.. You know who we are. Sorry
it came to this. I know you&rsquo;re expecting me to justify it right
away and make you deal with it when we leave, but that&rsquo;s not
how.. I operate I guess.&rdquo; He held out his paw optimistically.
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the deal. We really need the Jewel of the Stars
to save the world and stuff, but we&rsquo;ll pay you what it&rsquo;s
worth and fix your building if you help us with that. I pinky
promise. I know you don&rsquo;t have fingers either but-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He stared
at him like prey. &ldquo;-General Lemmy of the Koopa Troop offering a
business deal to me, arbiter of Neo Bowser City, epicenter of all
independent thinkers in Dark Land??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
inhaled. &ldquo;Umm. Yes?-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Just
like your uncle..&rdquo; The thwimp mused to himself, mellowing as he
detached the spike, leaving himself with a reverse mohawk. &ldquo;He
was blithe like you, strongly principled, but let fear or pressure to
conform ebb that away. Very well. You may &lsquo;rent&rsquo; that for
now.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy slid
the heavy gem closer, sobered. &ldquo;..Thanks, Mr. Mayor. What will
you do in the meantime?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The thwimp
hopped out of his chair into rubble, facing the street as he laughed,
&ldquo;Get outta dodge!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The World
8 Big Tanks blocked every sprawling route. The rocky wrenches allowed
the bruised whomps and thwomps, and the mayor as Lemmy lost track of
him, get away from the disaster zone but advanced so that the
koopalings were rounded up in the center at cannon point. Lemmy knew
his well of provisory leader&rsquo;s luck would run empty at a time
like this, stumped and sweating bullets rivaling the size about to be
shot at them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A lazy
image of Ludwig appeared on the barrel of the closest tank with a
book, as precariously as he did that kinda thing on airships. &ldquo;Tell
me you are not defeated already,&rdquo; he snorted.&rdquo;Tsk!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
shocked something out of Lemmy, waggling, &ldquo;No Luddy, however
I&rsquo;m seeing you. I-I&rsquo;m just out of tools!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Reevaluate.
Who is missing?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A split
second later, they all heard a call of &lsquo;FIRE&rsquo;.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&hellip;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Brace!&rdquo;
the purple capped one warned in the face of choppy dusk waters.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He and the
yellow toad crashed upon the shore of a jungly environment. Bus sized
ant troopers abandoned the hill they plowed into and climbed up moss
covered trees that vanished into the stormy clouds, the roars of
camouflaged creatures shaking the foliage. A troop of mega goombas
burst out, chasing the scampering orange clad toads inland until they
made their best, short legged, leap across a murky river. The goombas
smirked to each other and backed off, thunder cackling. Finally the
purple toad had the opportunity to pull off the snorkel and
pragmatically, the thick inmate uniform as well in favor of his
thinner white undershirt, clinging to his abs. The yellow less in
shape toad stopped staring. Nonetheless the emergency tracker in
their kit led them to the most hostile kingdom to be in late evening.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Mordecai..Schei&szlig;e.
This is belated. Sorry,&rdquo; Yellow spoke up. &ldquo;In my hubris I
thought I&rsquo;d honed in the psionic abilities I&rsquo;ve only
known I had since the brigade split up and I got myself checked out
by a nose, foot, elbow, and brain specialist in Dinosaur Land..&rdquo;
He took another breath. &ldquo;Obviously not. I&rsquo;ll take an L as
big as Stan and in the meantime, thanks for saving me from my idiocy.
I could kiss you right now.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mailtoad
flushed. &ldquo; You&rsquo;re welcome, but -&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I'm
joshing! We&rsquo;d better.. Hurry along shouldn't we?&rdquo; Yellow
Toad did just that..</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The threat
of super sized dangers, slithering wigglers, and razor toothed
piranha plants increased the deeper into the jungle they went,
following the river while avoiding viscous mud and man eating frogs..
It was survival time, in more ways than one.-</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Were
you really being farcical, J&ouml;rg? I wasn&rsquo;t uncomfortable or
anything, just curious,&rdquo; He shrugged frankly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Before any
hero moments Yellow low-key fancied Mailtoad&rsquo;s &lsquo;quiet
dignity and strength of character&rsquo; - that was to be referential
of Madame Flurrie, not to mention the physique born of rush
deliveries and working off season at the apiary.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Yes
and no. Princesses do that all the time when saved. I&rsquo;m aware
princes not so much, and it&rsquo;s moot when I&rsquo;m neither but
it&rsquo;s..The principle I guess. Okay fine and I think you&rsquo;re
hot,&rdquo; he admitted, brushing his bicep.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thank
you!&rdquo; he beamed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Indeed
with that cleared up, they could focus on the weather doing the
opposite. Lightning flashed heavy rains drenched them all over again,
as if they chose to take a dip in the skeeter and apparently shark
infested river. Yellow took a closer look at a dorsal fin crossing
by.</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Nothing
good ever lasts, as we all know,&rsquo; squeaked the matriarch of the
inland pod.</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-I
didn&rsquo;t know, Miss Daphne.&rsquo; The dolphin in the rear caught
up. &lsquo;I was called in for emergency lifeguarding at the Seaside
Kingdom earlier.&rsquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The family
spyhopped to look at the runt like an idiot. He got that alot, the
only of the Alderson pod that intermingled regularly with the
non-marine world.</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
were that close to the edge of the Earth??&rsquo; the gold ribbon
wearing daughter of the leader, Dora snapped.</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Why..
Sure. That&rsquo;s not what I asked.&rsquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She rolled
her eyes through those goggles. &lsquo;The CIA conspired against our
fabulous queen Wendy O., okay? Get with the program, Donald. They&rsquo;re
prohibited in Big Island.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
scientists that monitor us with satellites, not the government,
moron!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Huh?&rsquo;</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Nothing
ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo; the bilingual cetacean muttered.</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Perfect,
darling,&rsquo; the leader jumped back in. &lsquo;So in case you were
ABSENT for this too, a Fish Bone found a Spear Guy village! They&rsquo;re
about to sacrifice four toads that look like those gawking cityboys!&rsquo;</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yes
ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; Donald cruised atop the water momentarily,
apathetic to Yellow Toad reeling back from the edge. &lsquo;One day
they&rsquo;ll understand what waterfalls are...&rsquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-We
have to hurry!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yellow
clambered on a hanging vine to swing away quicker, but Mailtoad
remained on the ground waving at him. There were ukikis on the vines
too, veering it with their weight to the side and then abandoning it
before Yellow smacked against a beached steam powered cruiser. He
slid off the rusted hull as Mailtoad ran over though the mud,
stepping on a solid part.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Huh??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">An
unnaturally blocky part rose from the earth. &ldquo;Thank Eldstar.
Listen-&rdquo; Sergeant Howie coughed up gravel, a bigger crack in
the whomp&rsquo;s back than there was supposed to be. &ldquo;Yer off
the hook for everything, got it? We were combing the sea for ya
before pirates took over. Wouldn&rsquo;ta succeeded if your brigade
didn&rsquo;t distract me with this ebook, see. Taking advantage of my
multilingual abilities!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Officer,
are you sure you&rsquo;re okay-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
am!&rdquo; he shook Mailtoad, &ldquo;Not the hostages.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yellow
staggered up, fighting the headache. &ldquo;I know. The dolphins
mentioned it.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The cop
spun to him. &ldquo;You talk to animals, boy?? And I&rsquo;m crazy?
Nevermind- shh!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peeking
around the bow, the officer spied on some Giant Spear Guys
downstream. One shined around a headlamp while another attempted to
fill up a F.L.A.U.D. The third one, a guard armed with, in addition
to a spear, a pickaxe with a distinctive chip in the steel tied above
the grass skirt, idly thumbed through a leather postman&rsquo;s
satchel. As he tossed junk mail, Mailtoad welled with rage. That was
no one&rsquo;s call but the intended recipient!</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Whoa
nelly, cadet!..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mailtoad
stopped crunching tree bark subconsciously and observed with the
others how the trio retreated, rolled a random chomp rock over, and
activated a switch. The previously solid wall of tightly arranged
moss covered timbers lowered, revealing a torch lit village with
straw huts. The tracker&rsquo;s arrow aimed right in.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Now
go!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
dashed- or hobbled over before the timbers timed out and shot up,
sealing them in with the bustling area. Their stomachs churned while
sneaking behind huts. Masked natives were enraptured by dance and
tambourine, in denser numbers towards the granite rocks. The Captain,
Banktoad, Hint Toad, and Nass T. were individually tied to long
spears behind an amber glowing, pool sized cauldron. A stash of gold-
the brigade&rsquo;s was being melted in it under the direction of the
chief, distinguished by an elaborate red feathered headdress and
match horizontal stripes on his porcelain mask. The F.L.A.U.D. they
saw earlier was used to fill up a second big pot meanwhile, no
question of what was on the menu for that. The only delay for the
ceremony then was the downpour snuffing the fires. Nothing a
continual flow of matches couldn't fix&hellip;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">William..&rdquo;
The Captain&rsquo;s face was green. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t smelt
that garbage down soon enough!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Banktoad
glanced at his uncle exasperatedly, his single earring ravished.
Getting his ear pierced was the first thing he did after getting
kicked out of home, so he&rsquo;d rather be steam roasted with it
still in, vain as it seemed. Nass agreed, throwing a huge and
justifiable screechy fit when the normal sized Petal Guys found a
locket they&rsquo;d missed the first time, yanking it from her neck.
In retaliation from the kicks sustained, they lifted the pole with
her on it to the seasoning station, slathering the nurse with strange
leaves and stinky herbs. The men&rsquo;s protests got them pummeled
with fresh tomatoes.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-I
can&rsquo;t watch folks with a misdemeanor at most go through this!&rdquo;
Sergeant Howie seethed. &ldquo;Wait for the cue, cadets.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He stepped
out into the open with a fixed default expression, as if one of the
types of slab beasts susceptible to the twilight hour, waiting for
the precise moment. He tipped on one villager who stumbled into
another and another. The domino pileup reached the chief, who shifted
so that the final one banged into the newly boiling cauldron. While
it didn't flip, much of it sloshed out, a tenuous white steam cloud
blinding many.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yellow and
Mailtoad burst out of the shadows to rip off knotted vines from the
brigade, rewarded with a hard stare back, like they were a mirage.
The hostages snapped out of it largely when the chief howled for
attack. The jungle shook from the stomps of villager bare feet on hot
slick granite. The Captain used his herculean strength to push away
one boulder, breaking a narrow way into the jungle again, but before
he got started on another, a barrage of lances scattered the toads
like micro goombas in a haystack. The Captain climbed onto one of the
railed platforms moving side to side for a breather, a chaotic
skirmish beneath his single boot. Hint Toad&rsquo;s ebook reader with
the forbidden rites was long gone at this point, but as a blessing,
or curse fit to be distributed by black chest inhabitants, he
remembered all of the five phases the officer rather impressively
translated.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">IOILNDCARET
AILTCOON EOROOCMMD!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With a
brilliant flash brighter than his stolen headgear, a purple capped
white spotted &lsquo;DLC&rsquo; doppelganger of Captain Toad
materialized on the platform.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ready
for adventure!&rdquo; The copy&rsquo;s gleaming smile broadened as he
dropped into the fray and flung his pickaxe at the nurse's kidnappers
sneaking away. It tore through the first two pedal guys, stopping and
embedded in the spine of the third. The three dropped dead, coating
the nurse in gore, while the clone trotted about hacked and slashed
with a field knife.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There
are no truer words than, you have met the enemy, and it is you,&rdquo;
The Captain said with almost self reflection.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Banktoad
indignantly appeared under the platform, wanting to kill him. &ldquo;A
DHIUEASSMN EX,&rdquo; he uttered instead.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A snapshot
was taken, pausing the world. In the void of the universe, the photo
was valley folded once, opened again, the top corners creased, and
the sides folded one last time. A cosmic force propelled the
completed paper airplane through the rest of the interdimensional
sea.</font></p>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Brother,
you sure were acting pretty evil, ya know, taking advantage of folks
suffering DID, inciting violence against your own kinfolk, coercion
on princesses, grave robbing, and lying on medical discharge
documents, to be good all along as you claim.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
didn&rsquo;t say I was &lsquo;good&rsquo; babe,&rdquo; he snipped,
strapped in the backseat. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s too simplistic to
describe my project since my accident. I&rsquo;ve worked and
sacrificed nonstop to put me exactly where I am right now. K, maybe I
flew too close to the sun at times with that method acting but-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
brother!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Exactly,
mon ami.&rdquo; Bond ended that unexciting but highly important
headset call with a mysterious person. &ldquo;That hatred you had for
toads and humans was real, and please stop plagiarizing the madam&rsquo;s
book reports as well.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Vermin..&rdquo;
Kylie Koopa&rsquo;s papers were quickly sealed away from prying,
beady eyes. If she wasn&rsquo;t tin foil hatted, no telling what else
he would have stolen.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
wasn&rsquo;t, Bond. My magnum opus, the final Weegee report that&rsquo;ll
crack open every secret known to man is written out already in my
head. Years from now they&rsquo;ll be studying my posthumous
discoveries in Mystery Land! My psychic defenses are up so you </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">can&rsquo;t</font></em>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Aye

Peach and you will never see her again.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Will
I? And thank God you didn&rsquo;t say irregardless.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">This
will be the only time we agree on something.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No
it won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Mitch corrected smugly, getting out of a
rebuttal as the dark warp pipe ejected the Lexus into a bright
naturalistic environment with tightly packed cottages and precipitous
dips where the mist settled, shortly coasting to an inn.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jelectro
had an urgent appointment, leaving Kylie Koopa with the kart, the
first Mushroomite in modern record deported for tyranny, and of
course the story she was going to write on that. Nervous jitters
remained after the noki spy rendezvous with a utility cart driving
janitor and left, but she&rsquo;d consumed an energy bar earlier and
was up for any fight &lsquo;that ol Mitch&rsquo; might put up. He
plopped into the wheelchair and knocked on his own.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A caramel
skinned sky blue spotted toad answered lackadaisically like. &ldquo;-Oh..
The clean up dude? Really?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Really,&rdquo;
Mitch winked.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And
erm, parole officer,&rdquo; Kylie waved from further back.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">*sigh*
Ciri, alert our King again!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They were
led by another more skittish Skylandian through the town, scorched
black from a jet powered kart. Besides that, there were remnants of
Koopa Troop paraphernalia from yesterday, cannons, and brickwork, and
flags and whatnot, the green draining the further they went. It
wasn&rsquo;t that Bowser funk killing all that was live and healthy
however. In the copy flower farm ahead reside an half embedded, four
story tall, golden phanto mask with an especially exaggerated evil
grin. None of the holes could be seen through what should be a hollow
entity and by the whispers of locals, anyone who dared to travel a
mile down and peek on the other side either didn&rsquo;t come back or
were too shocked to speak about it. Kylie&rsquo;s hasty reach for the
camera and failure to snap a picture of it, confirmed her worst fear.
The Skylandians farmers remaining wouldn&rsquo;t step any closer. It
was too Special.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Camoztar
escaped the Blue Falcon in the fertile soil here, literally with the
natural onyx looking mineral underground,&rdquo; the wheelchair bound
toad said, thick eyebrows lowering. &ldquo;We havta get it outta
here.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
reporter dropped the DSLR. &ldquo;How the heck, Mitch?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A soldier
snuck up and confiscated Kylie&rsquo;s camera. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
publicize this!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They were
forced into the cloudy village with the restless others eager to
investigate, frustrated more by the flock of confused para-beetles
swinging low and bumping them around. Kylie got off her shell,
finding the rival journalist missing. Calming down, she scanned left
and right..</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Try
up, babe.&rdquo; Mitch smirked, looking down from the windmill. He
wheeled away from the ledge the winged koopas helped him reach. He
could not reach the floating red &ldquo;!&rdquo; block in the center
of the room though, so maybe he shouldn&rsquo;t have forced her to
chase him... This edifice was constructed of the same rune inscribed
glossy black substance the fated obelisk was one of the aerial
structures that survived the plunge.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Who&rsquo;s
up here?? Halt.&rdquo; A warrior class toad came up stairs, sneezing
right away from the dust.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Listen,
you&rsquo;ll die soon if you keep at this, Ciri. You&rsquo;ll never
retire to the Cascade Kingdom like you want, so give me the low down
instead dude. &rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Though
they had the dagger pressed against his neck, under the jaw, they
were the one shaking. Mitch didn&rsquo;t get offended from people
being terrified of him anymore; it&rsquo;s how he got syndicated
early in his career. Also why his parents tried to drown him when he
was two.. Having his time wasted however was never acceptable. When
the blade sunk deeper, an identical cut immaterially swiped across
theirs. Startled, Ciri dropped the weapon, letting Mitch shove them
back, hard against the block. It activated with a small chime,
dimming lit and the tower rumbled as the blades outside began to
circle. The warrior scuttled downstairs bleeding while the journalist
remained, dapping at the red blotch on his dress shirt. He licked it,
eyes clouding over.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Beyond the
metallicness, saltiness, it tasted like- </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Elysium.</font></em>
<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Now who had
swooped in and promised them that? If the turbine wasn&rsquo;t
reaching full speed he could ponder over that better.</font></p>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Besides
the iced over ocean, options of entry to this harsh, but rather rural
and untainted environment was traveling from the maze like Pipe Land,
enemy occupied Dark Land, or expedient pipes accessible by Warp
Whistle only, like the sort that sprang up out in the road, forcing a
snow man on a ski and a belly sliding penguin to swerve around it.
The noki and thwomp were shot out into the snow. The pipe retracted
and officially they were stranded there.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The red
boo watching from the igloo pulled on the tanooki fur cap and hurried
over to &lsquo;greet&rsquo; them. &ldquo;If it isn&rsquo;t Mr. Bond..
Oh and TJ. Can I call you that now?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Agent 999,
or Lt. &lsquo;TJ&rsquo; Stone, leaned around the boo, the tools on
his janitor costume jingling from his waist. &ldquo;No you cannot, M.
So, you rented those accommodations?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Heh.
Nope! Beat the buster beetle up. Bodies tied up around the-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jelectro

Take everyone out!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They were
yanked out of that stranger&rsquo;s home to a camp next door with a
fire, not as warm as the igloo one was, but it would have to work.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Spy
Captain Agent N was catatonic, mildly alarmed face gaped, laid back
first on a thick quilt next to the fire. The two of the quieter
agents sat on snow covered logs right away, Andrew Borod&#333; or
Agent 0069 and Emerson, Agent Toad. They were visibly freezing,
especially the purple bandit patched up enough to lose the cast. The
newly on the scene inlaws to the addled, Waldo Waldo and Jellien or
&lsquo;Maria&rsquo; Bond, not so much cocooned in winter gear.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jelectro
was tapped before joining the circle, Agent M&rsquo;s touch as
chilling as the scenery.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jeremy
shouldn&rsquo;t have trusted Charles from the moment it came out that
y&rsquo;all lived together and he started looking at us all cross
eyed. This blunder ain&rsquo;t commin&rsquo; off his record whether
he survives or not.&rdquo; M grit his jagged crowned teeth together.
&ldquo;-I really am sorry man.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jelectro
thawed. &ldquo;Thank you&hellip;Ultimately whatever happens from
there, I can recover. We all can, as long as Charles isn&rsquo;t the
last one standing.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A yellow
taxi, unmissable in the whiteout conditions swooped overhead, did a
loop, and landed cushiony soft on the snow. A few local bumpties
waddled beyond with no further notice, rods slung over their
shoulders. The human exiting the cab with spunk for his advanced age
also carried a line. He had a thinnish yet mildly pot bellied build,
white trilby and cardigan contrasting his peach skin, darker long
wool pants, and green loafers.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Greetings,
call me </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">D.
Zastre. </font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Nice
bunch by the way,&rdquo; he remarked. There was something about his
thin lips curling in amusement while he slid up those repaired in the
center swirly glasses. &ldquo;I get it. Enough about me. The real
star here is the Wakeman Spectre Rod, so here we go!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He swung
the blue glowing pole, casting the line down the spy captain&rsquo;s
open mouth. The old man was tugged forward violently by something
lurking in the yoshi&rsquo;s cavernous stomach, his shoe digging in
the ice. Everyone sans Jelectro instinctively careened backwards. The
winds intensified, everyone in the eye of a frosty <span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">storm.
</span></span></font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Too
late to run,&rdquo; he grunted. &ldquo;Might as well lend a-
Criminy&hellip;&rdquo; </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">D. Zastre
was in full view of the eldritch filled abyss down the yoshi&rsquo;s
esophagus. He resisted, but the agents scrambling to tug with him
were pierced thoroughly and paralyzed under the fear status effect. M
backed off, the only one unscathed, at least physically. Mentally he
was smashed to pieces, like the ice sculptures all over the place.
Should he run over, unchain that buster beetle, and use it to squeeze
that diddly clan out of the captain? Should he- Don&rsquo;t rack up
any more charges. Do this!. Duh, of course. He did what Jelectro
telepathically advised, poking the secret ticklish spot on Agent N&rsquo;s
belly button. The hoarse chuckles to follow ripped out a torrent of
boo diddlies. The agents regained control of their senses in time to
get swarmed as they inundated the mountainside, causing mass
pandemonium with the bumpty, chill bully, and snowman residents. Some
light cut through before they conglomerate into an Atomic Boo, the
offender Agent Toad. He wasn&rsquo;t hurting them, but from the
ground, holding N&rsquo;s head gently, Jelectro noticed it distracted
the boos so he ordered the agents to scramble back and follow the
gung-ho rookie&rsquo;s lead, luring them out of public eye. </font>

the mountain overlooking the village D. Zastre gave a chef&rsquo;s
kiss, back &lsquo;home&rsquo; instantaneously with shadow traveling
techniques. The cab driver left his groceries precisely where he
asked, with no snooping about his research tent by the absence of
footprints. He gathered the paper Northwinds Mart bag of dry pasta
when a new presence alerted him. The small boo didn&rsquo;t appear to
be there to soak in the view down, fit for a Festive Tree Day
postcard. </span></font></span></em>

<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">When

something useful by &lsquo;cursing&rsquo; it, the same principle as
those Special Objects that are all the rage. I wish I could, ah hem,
dabble like I used to, but if you found me, you have the resources
already sonny.&rdquo; </span></font></span></em>

rare red aurora borealis. &ldquo;Anyway, King Boo is penniless and

piranha plant ducked into the pipe before the saucer hovered over,
continuing to enrage the Pipe Land populous during its invasion of

that the king let that chimeric head doctor pry some land from his
leafy stems for a remote research facility. There were prospects of
weather machines, clone generators, and genetic alteration of

spectacles. Or what the term now &lsquo;hipster&rsquo;? Or whatever. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Zoo
bewilderedly lifted up like the alarm went off two hours late. &ldquo;AH

the smallest, meekest voice he could. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Zoo
glanced around at the bristling grass and trees. It seemed legit.
This was Earth, he felt&hellip; very funny, but of course he would,
he guessed. Milly was the real deal, auspicious enough, totally
ripping off Rosalina&rsquo;s Gravitational Pull. He could relate to
the rip off part! Maybe he&rsquo;d listen this one time.</span></font></span></em></p>

<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">The
momentum Mr. Toad had bursting out of Peach Castle died before he was
off the drawbridge. Pewter shaded dust matte the entire sky of Toad
Town and starbits, a colorful sweet like substance showered all over
castle grounds. He floundered around at the mercy of the flow of the
candies, often whacked painfully against stones, abandoned guard
tanks, and trees. Five bruises later he stabilized on something, the
cannon. He grasped for the nearby flag pole and climbed as it swayed
to get the big picture. The concentration was thinner on Royal
Raceway where evacuees were bigger dots against tinier ones. He faced
back to the castle getting whittled away from Star Hills
deterioration and made his decision. The three flags were there, a
Peach, a Mushroom Crest, and a white. Symbolically surrendering what
was replaceable to the angered gods, he ripped the white flag from
the ropes, tied two ends to his ankles, the others to his wrist and
leapt off with the makeshift parachute. </span></font></span></em>

spiral before abruptly dropping like a rock into what was left of the
raceway lake. The starbits displaced it all over the pavement, even
into the downtown so it was more of a crunch into a deep puddle,
followed by the weak rising of a five digited wiggling hand out of
it. &ldquo;... Toad!?&rdquo; </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">He
scooped him out, bringing him back. &ldquo;The King and his league
abandoned us! We were going to chase, and some of your staff did
anyway, but without verifying you and Toadsworth were safe the rest
of us couldn&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t know why I assumed you two had to
be out here somewhere already,&rdquo; he sputtered. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Toad

<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Wishing
he didn&rsquo;t speak so soon, Toad slid to the ground on his own,
approaching the princess. While her gown was tattered from the
sprint, he knew she was semi hiding herself with the parasol because
of her hair. Long, healthy as it always was in volume, it was pure
white. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">This

<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">He

of the green toad&rsquo;s pockets spilt hundred coin bills,
documents, and an object wrapped in velvet. Peach tripped back from
it like it was hissing venomous cobrat, caught by the toads
remaining, the chef, the new kid and the blue toad.. Bucken-Berry got
the brunt of the impact, the wind knocked out of him. That was fine.
His strength hadn&rsquo;t waned considerably from depression or
anything. Meanwhile a K64 ticket whisked over Toads shoe. </span></font></span></em>

<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">-Mr.
Toadsworth was the son of the Queen&rsquo;s.. Sister in another
Mushroom territory,&rdquo; Toadette explained, in the rawest
educational opportunity ever. Though Toad was making a face, no one
stopped her so- &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why &lsquo;Samuel&rsquo; had a
human name before that was in vogue. It was scandalous of course, but
when the war ramped up and our princess was born, the Queen was able
to get Mr. Toadsworth away from the infantry and into the castle
without the purity tests.. He confessed in his letter to me that that
was never to be known before his death, so when this gets around to
him-&rdquo; </span></font></span></em>

banker. During that talking, what&rsquo;s supposed to be a free
action for the civilized, he&rsquo;d taken the gem and bolted towards
the disarrayed city. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Peach
encouraged the others to go ahead, noticing something odd about this
all. The Lakitu Bros and other pedestrians were approaching from the
famous big ramp, meaning there were no obstacles in the way of her
sneaking off via the pitstop lane. </span></font></span></em>

Daisy shook the hood off, unleashing that frizz of auburn hair. &ldquo;This
is only like that time I was on house arrest&hellip;Kidding. Umm.
What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">She

</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Daisy
was galvanized to hop in. They sped off, whippers on high to combat
the starbits. Citizens sheltered inside or pulled over so it was a
straight shot to the train station. Mostly. </span></font></span></em>

<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">The

</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Daisy
broke out of the reverie, sitting up. &ldquo;Besides King B.- that&rsquo;s
my dad, blowing me up to come home for the weekend, don&rsquo;t I
talk too much and make everything worse? Can&rsquo;t forget that
cringy engagement story..&rdquo; </span></font></span></em>

</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">You

</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">No,
it&rsquo;s.. s&rsquo;alright!&rdquo; she mimicked earnestly, badly
either way. &ldquo;That old headache of mine believed it is all that
matters.&rdquo; </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Pfft.
Imma be real,&rdquo; Daisy laughed, relaxing some. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d
better. You don&rsquo;t need filters on your Tick-Tock Clock page
like those e-thots. All you need is that super modest magenta (kinda
old fashioned but it&rsquo;s good on you) swimsuit on the beach and
those round sparkle shades, oh and waving does the trick.&rdquo; </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Oh
Daisy,&rdquo; she replied, demurely. Peach had admirers and knew this
abjectly, though it hit different to hear it unfiltered, the way only
a hierarchical peer could deliver. -Or to be more honest with
herself, in a way only Daisy would because that was just her. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Snapping
back to her surroundings, she jabbed the break on purpose. A high
pitched whistle preceded the K64 shuffling under the station. Noting
waiting patrons, disappointment didn&rsquo;t cover it for Peach. Mr.
Zeror didn&rsquo;t have one confederate. Two. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">A
larger purple toad left the office first, clueless until the second,
a pink one tapped him. It was too late to run. Joe simply admitted
that his part in the scheme involved Chef Timothy living rent free in
his head as much as assisting that uppity Zeror. The heist would get
him attention.. Les&rsquo;s excuse involved no rancor, yet publicity
alike, wanting to see Gill T. and reunite classic rock band The
Keptos. Peach twirled a lock, listening. It had him comfortable
talking about it, all the while she knew all of her citizens and the
deceased too by name. Gill T., the Mario brother&rsquo;s neighbor was
dead. Fact checked, the large toad bolted off onto the starbit
powered sidewalk. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Yo,
mind if I cut on subtitles?&rdquo; Daisy broke off the fierce
cornering the remaining one pose to ask. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Peach
remembered her Sarasalandian friend was probably lost with half the
conversation in sign language. Joe communicated something to Daisy
she did understand, replying to the rude gesture by popping him. The
gardener flipped over the rail, off of the station and into bushes
below. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Daisy
stepped back flusteredly. &ldquo;Went nuclear, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
</span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Peach

was overdue. Like this.&rdquo; </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Daisy
seized in place as the other princess planted a gentle kiss on her
cheek, the typical post rescue display of affection, but to Daisy
like the first blossoms of spring in Easton, the powerful rapids of
Muda, more knee buckling than the pyramids of Birabuto, more
breathtaking than soaring through the skies of Chai in a SkyPop&hellip;
When Peach&rsquo;s face was no longer brushing against her&rsquo;s,
separating governessy, the jet plunged beautifully, fiery crash
included. </span></font></span></em>

<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Daisy
folded her arms, cooly. &ldquo;I pop off on him alot over bets. He

<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Princess!!!&rdquo;

</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">The
princesses stumbled out onto Starman Lane where Mr. Zeror was on the
sidewalk, holding his lower abdomen and hacking up blood.
Eviscerated, a gelatinous blob left his throat, the bile from it
rolling down the soft slope, beyond Daisy&rsquo;s sneakers, and
underneath one additional legless viewer of the sick show. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">I

</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Peach
breathlessly twisted in the direction of Zoo S. Diddley, holding the
bag containing the Jewel of the Stars. Zoo confirmed he picked the
wrong word seeing her about to swat at him with the parasol but not
dodging with that knowledge. The dark boo was flung out into the
middle lane as Luigi, Toadette, Thomas, Chef Tim, and Mr. Toad
struggling a bit, caught up. Zoo had a flash of something, a lost
memory returning, overshadowed by the impulse to run. He sank
underground before a trio of plasma beams ripped it all up. Luigi
dropped his head to one area of the tar not melting as Bucken-Berry&rsquo;s
dragon form flew over. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">He

</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">He
jumped out of the way as the second blast blew up the spot he was on.
Dirt and concrete bits raining, the green plumber careen over to
investigate, seeing the strolling compartments below of the Toad Town
104, a cargo only locomotive. A spontaneous move unlike him, he
dropped down into the compartment of bananas. He heard several more
impacts behind him, followed by a &lsquo;we&rsquo;re okay!&rsquo;
that wasn&rsquo;t entirely believable. Regaining his bearings, it
gave him the courage to soldier on more than ever. During his short
stunt as official protector of all, inspiring them to launch into
danger so recklessly, but swiftly and resolutely made him feel like
his brother.</span></font></span></em></p>

Candy needed to clear the moat. No more rain or snow, no more KT
hostile bad guys, and no more trouble. Okay, a koopatrol instantly

mounted behind his throne, jumbo gold filled treasure chests were on
sturdy shelves, territory maps were tacked up on the opposite side-
of which he could lawfully visit as a neutral, and the masonry of the
impending lava fountain the corner. There was a scantily filled
trophy case too, of course..a project for later. Peeling back his
diamond hard exterior, what brought him true joy was no longer the
conquest and demonstrations of militaristic prowess as satisfied
young Bowser. At the age of fifty-six and four months, it was family,

<p><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">&quot;-Yeah
yeah. This mercenary showed up with ..&quot; Sentry 11 drummed

</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">The
moment they ran out, someone burst his window out with a brick,
cracking against a wall. The psychopath. It was inches from the Mario
poster! He stomped to it, flames practically shooting out of his eyes
at T. Yoshisaur in his red parched lawn, motor rally helmet held
against his hip. Of course, with that cannon arm of his. Kamek still
ranted to this day. He and three other chumps had a four rider bike.
Goombario also shed the helmet, as did the poochy but not the
abnormally large koopa in a trench coat. He tried to pry it off,
failing. Oddly, Bowser began to sympathize. Those things weren&rsquo;t
made for big folks. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Why

lizard, I &lsquo;kidnapped&rsquo; him!&rdquo; Bowser&rsquo;s baritone
bounced off the volcanic ranges. He moved away, ending the exchange. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em>&hellip; </em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">On
the ground. Yoshi gulped hard. They used superstars to keep up with
the Blue Falcon, always with the back thrusters in view, except when
the invulnerable hand traps sprung out. While they strafe to avoid
the crash, the shy guy traitor could not. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">We

castle. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Everyone
got on the bike again to retreat, too sluggish without a power up and
prime targets for bob-ombs on parachutes. After the back wheel was
blown off, they were run ragged uphill, where the minions closed an
electric gate behind them, locking them out of the courtyard. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Are

</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Mr.
X had to be satisfied with raising the visor on the helmet, revealing
eyes as deep and red as they were unreadable. &ldquo;Believe it or

</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">-The

<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">A

do I feel? Ha ha...&rdquo; Mario droned, taking a few wobbly steps
towards the trophy case. &ldquo;All he put me through is so how I
wanted the day to end.&rdquo; He took Bowser and swung him against
the case, his spiky shell shattering the first level of glass. &ldquo;Look,
I am outta here, or else!&rdquo; </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Can

</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Mario
sighed, taking his weight off the koopa. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t

</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">His

</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">He

</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Sorry

</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Mario
fizzled somewhat. That was as treacherous a topic as Bob-omb
Battlefield. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">The
war going south for us shafted the elites like her into the peasant
class. She was a cook at a camp I was running, overqualified, loved
numbers and very particular about random stuff. She was super fair
for instance. She sent gifts down to her cousins that were poorer,
perfectly even in value. If not she&rsquo;d send the difference in
coins. That kinda stuff. Relevant to us though she had the discipline
to ration the food. I was pissed off at first, but when my troop had
the energy to hold squads off because we all ate I got the point. You
know she could throw a spike ball better than a spike, too? Now, fast
forward to my shotgun crowning. You heard me. They tried to hide it,
I think not to sink or morale more, but they were so disappointed
they were left with me.&rdquo; </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">..That
was messed up,&rdquo; Mario said, air thinning. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">His
heavy gaze was fixed on the plumber&rsquo;s boots, scorched from the
crash. Darn. &ldquo;Tell me bout it.. I said screw that. I'll do what
I want. Clawdia and I eloped and my only regret then was that Dad
never got a chance to yell at me over making the &lsquo;wrong&rsquo;
choice. It&rsquo;s like this, Mario.&rdquo; He paused, before
pressing on. &ldquo;I was a doofus last night. Here&rsquo;s my
do-over.&rdquo; </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">The
Koopa King closed the distance, almost lounged, for a kiss before he
could talk himself out of it. The softness of his beard brushing his
snout, and the warmth from the human&rsquo;s hands flowing around his
collar to the scales beneath, the rare opportunity to comb through
the plumber&rsquo;s slick hair.. With the ambient temps in the
nineties, Bowser had a case of the chills. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">C-can
I say something?&rdquo; Mario pulled back. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">The
roles switched, Bowser nodded gently, intently studying the plumber&rsquo;s
reddened face. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Bowser.
I like you too. Alot. It&rsquo;s just, you did have a point last
night. Maybe we shouldn't rush this right now. What&rsquo;s causing
this?&rdquo; </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">The
poignant question shook Bowser out of his blank stare. He faintly
made his way to this desk again. &ldquo;That meditation thing! I&rsquo;m
the same age my dad was when was murdered, if that&rsquo;s not the
time to gather yourself.. &rdquo; </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Mario
sat on the edge of it. &ldquo;I get that, but we can&rsquo;t elope if
that&rsquo;s where you were going.&rdquo; </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">He
shrugged casually. &ldquo;I thought maybe I&rsquo;d convince ya if we
went somewhere romantic, like the Rainbow Cruise.&rdquo; </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Cute,
fine he&rsquo;d give him that, alas, he slid off the desk and drifted
away. &ldquo;Bowser.. It&rsquo;s.. still a &lsquo;not now&rsquo; for
me.&rdquo; </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Bowser
waited until he was over a certain spot and then slapped a button.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m kidnapping you unironically then!&rdquo; </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">His
new and improved layer&rsquo;s chandelier dropped right on Mario,
tangling him up before it lifted him to the ceiling again. Meanwhile
lava guzzled out of the ducts for the fountain, filling the space. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">You
cannot be serious right now!&rdquo; the plumber growled. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Without
an answer, Bowser left the throne, everything a blur. Though he
didn&rsquo;t throw such a fit back there, in his mind the walls
peeled, the floor crumbled, and the roof disintegrated. What was
coiled in him all along, it snapped. He saw himself from the outside,
zombied, unsure how he got down a floor with the crone and that old
tube radio in the hallway. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Dearie,&rdquo;
Kammy began, dismayed &ldquo;there&rsquo;s word of a train accident
not too far-&rdquo; </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">The
Koopa King swatted the antique away. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Like
he cared. Trainwreck would better describe his heart. </span></font></span></em>

throne room. He couldn&rsquo;t ignore this anymore, conceding to hold
down the buzzer. His old man might get it. He&rsquo;d gone senile in
reverse afterall, sane-ish now compared to the baby-obsessed, yoshi

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser

the raindroplet-filled window for a clearer reception, his ghostly,
distraught reflection staring back. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be in the
slammer! How are you gonna take over in a year?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Vater-

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">An
outdoors patrol minion resisted the urge to clip on earphones. From
the dry bone&rsquo;s vantage point, his lord was in the window
unblinkingly. Shortly he gave in to old habits, it evident Bowser
wasn&rsquo;t really seeing anything.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Can&rsquo;t
you help us?&rdquo; one on the road begged, starbits up to their
neck. Tremors raked through the city as Star Hill spewed like a
volcano.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
am. I swear. I apologize it doesn&rsquo;t appear that way..&rdquo;<br/>
&hellip;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A bright
arrow sliced across the ancient ruins and desert plains of Southern
Mushroom Kingdom, outgunning tweesters and Mecha-Yoshi to reach the
other side. Stopping the mach speed kart was more difficult, sliding
beyond the rusty old factory she targeted, and almost off a coastal
cliff, waves crashing below. She coaxed the kit build to a stop after
a loud spinny show, scaring the King&rsquo;s nobles into the gem
encrusted caves. No longer in motion, she let herself breathe. The
King could have fled anywhere with the headstart he had, yet he chose
the old quarry she suspected. Best yet, the guards had quit it
appeared, so no threat of return firepower. Rich veins connecting to
the Rock Candy Mines, it was also the passage her ancestors used to
follow the &lsquo;call of the stars&rsquo; and settle in the Mushroom
Kingdom, and the first labor camp she closed down upon take over.
Abandoning it to locals led to the modern day dichotomy where the
South had podunk yet wealthy towns, prone to mutiny to her
government, but amiable with her personally.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bam! The
red hot king kicked open factory doors, broad chest rising and
falling, and a sword strapped to his side. Finding his daughter
pocketing a winding key, more pale than Queen Chanterelle ever got,
his rage faded.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Father,
a curse is devouring me, my friends, and my kingdom. Can you help me,
or will I deal with this on my own?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Concern
flitted across his hard face before he twisted off his signet ring,
his beard going from straight and black to scraggly gray. &ldquo;-Daughter,
you got your subjects to supply you with their allegiance, labor, and
love on your own. I&rsquo;ll cut you slack now.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She closed
it in her palm. &ldquo;Father, thank you, sincerely&hellip; Also I
believe.. It&rsquo;s pertinent you check on your toads right now.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Her loud
roaring escape in the gray primer painted kart bowled him over with
red dust. Next he knew, the toads he could be chasing down, tugged
him deeper into the fuzzy infested cave. Before he fussed at them, he
was knocked off his feet again, the factory exploding into flames.
Jr. Troopa&rsquo;s ostro riding ranchers would sniff around after the
King&rsquo;s toads wore him down. Conclusion: autobomb.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Careful
there.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The young
man in the cell opposite patted the pile of gunpowder against the
brick wall. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m good at this, trust me.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">As
much as I am running and jumping around here?&rdquo; the other
prisoner spoke up &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re at least half as much you&rsquo;ll

doing to work.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Spy Guy
whipped his way, barely able to see him in the dark candle lit
dungeon. &ldquo;-I thought you quit being a plumber to be a stay at
home dad for the koopa kids, not some riddler.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Better
career change than secretary to felon.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Spy Guy
lit a match, growling, &ldquo;Just back up!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His
explosive pile popped with a lot of smoke. The agent allotted for
crumbling debris then charged for it. He smacked against the same
solid brick wall, only blackened.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
rolled his eyes behind iron bars. &ldquo;With podoboos, flame bars,
and fire bros, KT gunpowder is an eighth as strong as the Mushroom
Kingdom stuff..&rdquo;</font></p>

with the-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Hey,
hush yo mouth!&rdquo; a guard barked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Spy Guy
simmered on his bench as Mario snorted. 'Good try sport', that was a
pretty eventful thirty second shift change to give him credit&hellip;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">See,
just like that they shut up. Totally a cool job.&rdquo; The koopatrol
swung the key around his gauntlet covered finger, training the toad
in chainmail armor by bringing her into the dungeon, usually the job
of the whomp holding the torch. &ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No?
Emery, I have a question then for you.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
flushed as they held up on the steps. &ldquo;Y-yeah?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
dumb, but.. why do we have different &lsquo;Mushroomcratic oaths?&rsquo;&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
distantly stared down the corridor. &ldquo;Both halves were part of
Princess Mush IV&rsquo;s wedding vows. It&rsquo;s a super messed up
story. They would always focus on the bratty part, blaming her for
the war. Still I respect her. She lived- and died authentically. Can
I change the subject? Can we pet the chomps?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Behind
her, Whomp #5, Lucius, desperately shook his head.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">..It&rsquo;s
past feeding time,&rdquo; the koopatrol probed. &ldquo;Plus I almost
lost an arm last week!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;d
always begged for one and never got it from mom, so I swore I&rsquo;d
adopt one myself. I know of the breeds, behaviors, how not to lose
limbs.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jeez!&rdquo;
he chuckled.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
brightened a little. &ldquo;And their calls. ~SIR SNAPULA!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The whomp
took flight, through the maze of the dungeon and outta there.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Crap!&rdquo;
They chased him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
shortly sprung up with a cup of drain cleaner. Actually orange juice,
kept in the castle fridge, the least requested snack watchmen could
give prisoners. Spy Guy&rsquo;s choice of a processed energy bar was
useless and as thick as the bricks he couldn&rsquo;t blast. Mario&rsquo;s
was his key out of there.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">If
you were sick of my math Charles, check out my chemistry.&rdquo;
Mario splashed the juice at the bottom of the bars and kicked them
out while sizzling from the acid.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He crawled
under and was out of there, sneaking to the BACK DOOR passage and
around the ninjis, mecha-koopas and non light generating lava pits
with ease. When fresh air and a gentle sprinkling of rain hit him, he
noticed just how shallow his breaths had become during those routine
maneuvers.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Greetings,
just hauling her in for repair!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He gasped
at the upside down clown car inching along, unsubtly dodging the
sweep of spot lights.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No
worries, we&rsquo;re Trojan &amp; Co. from Isla Falsa. Check us out
on Welp, old pal.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi!&rdquo;
They hugged under the cover of the contraption.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario,
I&rsquo;m sorry! I will never leave you in peril again.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
plumber gave them space, holding the dino&rsquo;s shoulders. &ldquo;I
put myself in danger. I should be apologizing. Let&rsquo;s scram.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wait,
I sent Goombario in,&rdquo; he mentioned unsteadily. &ldquo;Because
they-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bang!
Nerves shattered by the loud disturbance, they lifted the clown car.
The source was the top floor of Bowser Castle.</font></p>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bucken-Berry
wished he didn&rsquo;t do those cathartic, over the ocean plasma
blasts while tracking the Toad Town 104. Hey, most of his games
didn&rsquo;t have ontological inertia. How&rsquo;d he foresee them
hitting some random village over the horizon. Looked like Sky Land,
what came after Pipe Land that he&rsquo;d torched up too.Blistering
hot plasma was mostly around the mulchy outskirts, only destroying
one windmill and something that was gold, the sea flowing over-</font></p>

<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The koopa
grabbed the journalist&rsquo;s dress shirt, popping buttons.
&ldquo;Jelectro&rsquo;s gone, so drop the front. You set up this
Phanto Mask, or this &lsquo;Camoztar&rsquo; thing to melt into a heap

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">To

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She bore
into him.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Remember
what I predicted when we were kids?..&rdquo; He pried her fingers
away. &ldquo;There&rsquo;d be something special about Princess Peach.
I admit I had a lot of wrong ideals. First trying to work for her,
later trying to chop her down. I didn&rsquo;t get the actual
interpretation right until today, so if you don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m
humbled, screw you.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
backed off and retrieved her bag, camera, other articles, disgusted.
&ldquo;I gave ya a chance. There&rsquo;s no frenemy between us,
you&rsquo;re just on your own now.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
flattened out his clothes. &ldquo;This was my purpose.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">To
ruin a popular route for fruit trains???&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
monster popped up from behind the big warehouse. &ldquo;<b>It&rsquo;s
not just carrying fruit!&rdquo;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The lamp
of the TT104 was a mile down, illuminating how heat traveled down the
rails and popped rivets on the bridge, sagging over the deep canyon.
Bucken-Berry tapped the receiver stuffed into his ear.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">GET
OUT! MR. LUIGI AND THE REST OF YOU JUMP! IT'S GONNA CRASH!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He wrapped
his tendrils around the train as it bulleted by, digging his feet in.
He was dragged belly first, soil and molten gold splattering across
the field and bogies sparking. The middle of the three heads noticed
a compartment with lamps on. He kicked a free leg against it,
derailing that while the half he was attached to tethered on. He let
go, sliding as the 104 snapped the bridge and crashed against the
side of the ravine. The blast shook many out of their cottages, and
even more when the bright white plume rose against the black sky.
Something was within it, an iridescent scintillating rapscallion
slowly emerging from the heap of twisted metal, seven pointed, the
size of a mushroom bus.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">FOOLISH
ONE,&rdquo; Rapscintillation loomed over land, blanching onlookers.
After an indeterminable flash of emotion, &ldquo;YOU ARE VERY LUCKY.&rdquo;
The powerful being launched away with a sonic, window shattering
boom, just what the monster needed to snap out of it.</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It
was over, oh stars&rsquo; Bucken-Berry relayed over and over, pressed
back against one of the big green hills. That&rsquo;s when the triple
headed beast caught a scent he couldn&rsquo;t ignore, swiveling
towards the wreck again.</font></p>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With no
feet to worry about getting on, Zoo was pushed past Luigi, Toadette,
and Daisy in the heap of splintered planks and cargo, out of the pits
into the wilderness. He rested back against a huge super bell tree,
uncontrollably shaking. After leaves and acorns dropped on him, it
only increased, finding himself under six red glowing dots above.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
was brainwashed to steal like I told your friends! You know what it&rsquo;s
like to not be in control of yourself?&rdquo; Zoo jumped away from
under the tree, emboldened. If he could read him so easily he was
untouchable. &ldquo;Drew will track me down any minute anyway, bro
and he don&rsquo;t want anything happening to me. Hey, I caught him
trying to stalk your Instaham instead of Jackson&rsquo;s for once.
Heads up.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bucken-Berry
wasn't flattered, continuing to tongue flick. <b>&quot;You've killed
a bunch of folks Drew doesn't know about, and you ain't sorry!&quot;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
casually weaved around Yoshi berry bushes. &quot;Eh, I regret giving
this one chill dude a- how'd Drew explain it once, oh yeah diffuse
axonal injury. Ala-Gold was a goner before he hit the dirt and bled
all over the place. The mess is always from the death ray attacking
soft tissue. Ain't science neat?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Like
I said, you aren't sorry,&quot; the monster hissed in his real voice,
following his sad attempt to slip.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo cast a
nasty look up there. &quot;You don't know me.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
didn't know your victims.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
aren't a god.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yet

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">When Luigi
and co hobbled over, there was no fugitive left to apprehend.
Nothing, and the scent of burning and death striking his nostrils, he
knew why. The green plumber decided that, with red and blue lights on
the horizon they&rsquo;d better take a detour. In the ash field, he
contacted the princess about how rapidly this was spiraling. Her
reaction-</font></p>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
aren&rsquo;t angry!!!!!&rdquo; a koopa jogger megaphoned Toad, the
dummy on the outside of the barrier into Royal Raceway instead of
behind it. &ldquo;We are simply concerned about the state of our
kingdom!!!!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad&rsquo;s
ears had the muted ring of a sepia toned war flashback. Fitting, when
he was the last toad standing in a way. Many were leaving town,
displeased over what appeared to be a stalemate between Peach and her
father, or spooked by other happenings, and whoever weren&rsquo;t
were in the mob right here. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not gonna try to
convince any of you that your feelings aren&rsquo;t valid. I&rsquo;m
just gonna say this. If I get elected in Neo Bowser City, you&rsquo;ll
start to have a choice. &quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Then he
could hear a pin drop. There it went, spelt differently rather, from
the scuffed up Lakitu Bro pushing his way to the front. &ldquo;Mr.
Toad Kinopio Toad, for the record, what&rsquo;s special about that
place?&ldquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mayor
Koton is a jerk, greasing the roads, the enslavement obviously, and
holding mail hostage, but he fought to make it a democracy so props
to letting himself be challenged. Me being there, so blasphemously or
whatever, and on a commoner level is important for other toads and
non-toads alike to see. If I&rsquo;m terrible, for once the people
can haul my butt out.&quot;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Interesting,&rdquo;
murmured a bob-omb buddy. Others side eyed, but listened.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Good
speech, if uncouth..&rdquo; Chef Tim friendly fired out of nowhere.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
shrugged. If feeling better was going to be the trend the more he
went mask off, maybe he could handle this. &ldquo;Ask me anything.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadia
overtook the Lakitu Bro trying to take notes in his palm. &ldquo;Why
did you reject the Luigi fan club offer five times?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad sat
up on the square barrier for that one. &ldquo;It&rsquo;d be creepy
when I was already his best friend and I didn&rsquo;t know how else I
felt about him.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Her
friends raised cain. Others dispersed with the latest gossip, their
thirst for vengeance quenched, Toad guessed. Thomas slyly poked his
head out of a traffic barrel he'd hid in.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sir,
how did you know?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
relished every moment with him.. On slow days, when life was hectic.
Good times, even bad.. And I understand that&rsquo;s squarely friend
zone, don&rsquo;t mash those together, for most, but for me I
couldn&rsquo;t ignore the feeling of, &lsquo;oh I&rsquo;m in love.&rsquo;
Happy?-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A blue
birdo waved for attention. &ldquo;Favorite color?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
loosened his collar. &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not red. Let&rsquo;s get
that out of the way.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">One in the
crowd dipped out after the reveal, his black kimono hiding colorful
Yakuza tattoos, and shades his distinctive face. With only so many
hours of daylight left, he had six or seven more old sponsors to
shake down over seized assets. After actually losing a shouting match
with a lowly item shop employee Saleisha, the blogger realized that
the in person forum and the integrity shown by the Earl he was named

Douglas&rsquo; Piranha Pipes kart took him away from the tropical,
island hopping route into northern wintry conditions. A former
vehicle of the Isle Delfino police, its goop proof nature made
getting around easy. He struggled rather to find the sergeant and
their inmates. Soon flurries were accumulating on his cap. He zipped
up his coat as the regional emergency calls came in on the radio,
thick accented citizens somewhere in the ice block forts reporting on
a statue busting maniac.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
officer radioed back: &lsquo;Description?&rsquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What they
described the officer found, skidding around a frozen lake where
mountains were leveled. Shuddering, the human crouched, tapping one
key at a time on his computer. &lsquo;SUSPECT. ARMED. DANGEROUS,&rsquo;
it blared. He pinched his hat brim, the investigator completely green
at the violent cases. Whatever the boo diddly was doing, it appeared
like a banzai bill had dropped.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Fighting
his fears, He shakily put the spotlight on them. &ldquo;Booigi.&rdquo;
He let the intercom stop screeching. &ldquo;You prefer that, don&rsquo;t

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">From the
cruiser rolling up, Snifit Patrol saw the suspect secured in the rear
of the Pipe kart. Best of all, his fellow, and presently only other
officer had his head on his body still. &ldquo;Great job, Doug. No

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Their
vehicles parallel. Douglas leaned over. &ldquo;Don't jinx it.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The snufit
got the hint pretending to jot notes when Booigi was facing them.
&ldquo;Well well. To the precinct for Mx. Diddley. I&rsquo;ll pop in

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">From

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The snufit
nodded, revving up his more powerful engine. &ldquo;Suspended

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sweeping
the Sky Land villagers doing their meager rescue work, the ancient
star pensively loomed over the lonesome toad, traveling through the
adversity of mud caked wheels. Millennium Star wasn&rsquo;t ignorant
of Mitch&rsquo;s disdain for Zoo. When &lsquo;rebuilding&rsquo; the
dark boo on a molecular level, he poured over the vivid snapshot of
the green toad mangled up in a vehicle. He did not count on the
reporter going so far to smudge Zoo out of this world that he&rsquo;d
stage a rail accident, the commotion and, oddly specific, the gamma
rays emanating from another party involved keeping him from swooping
in to preserve his death ray spouting pet.</font></p>

at it from another angle.)&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The most
shameful moment he could remember in eons, Millennium stared dumbly
at that.. toad shaped abomination. He lashed out, the zap making the

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Merely..

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There was
a chance this wasn&rsquo;t what he thought. Bowser cleared the lump
in his throat. &ldquo;X chump, I looked into all you do for the

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Or

claws shielding himself from the scepter brought out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">If there
wasn't a safety on the new models of these things, Bowser feared he
might have vaporized him there. Minions, rookies as intentionally
chosen, dumped the captive in his throne room. Without that clothing
there was no obfuscating that Mr. X was a wimpish powder blue scaled
dragon koopa with beady grayish eyes, stubby horns, curly red hair,
and a pencil mustache. Advanced in years or not, Clarentine Ao Koopa.
-Senior, technically. The ring wasn&rsquo;t fooling him though, his
brother had never wed or sired any kids. There was a look to that,
unignorable, like how this was the guy that ensured the deathbed

forever. &lsquo;It was such a shame that his kingdom was going to the

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">X
sputtered, &ldquo;The Troop was going to use me as a weapon. I
expressed that readily and no one listened, so I had to sever my
connections forcibly Bowser, you realize that!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He pressed
harder. &ldquo;What kept you away when I&rsquo;d sacked all the

&ldquo;Bowser.. Believe me. You remember why I proposed we attach
wings to our ships? A mine hit a ship I was in, and down it went
easily. I washed up on Mushroom Territory penniless. I was spared
only because no one, including myself, knew who I was.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
wished he didn&rsquo;t believe him, scalding tears rolling. One
emotion presided however, so quickly it surprised him, expressed by
the heavy treasure chest he lobbed at his brother. Mr. X ducked as it
struck and dented his iron door. The Koopa Bros grappled, bulky
shells on both punching walls, feet stamping glass shards.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Okay
fine whatever you lost your memory, but why didn&rsquo;t you do
something- at least write me when you got it back?!?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;d
have- It&rsquo;s generous to call them &lsquo;partners&rsquo;, but..
Ah!&rdquo; X was dragged across the desk, flipping with it. &ldquo;Stars
that hurts&hellip;. they&rsquo;d get so antsy if I dare mention
Darklandian matters..&rdquo; He stood up, gasping for air.. &ldquo;Bowser..
If you ever lived in their world, the smallest gesture could ruin
you. I was always the &lsquo;exception&rsquo;.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
lowered the bookcase he was about to bash over his head. &ldquo;&hellip;Sorry
man.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hmph.
Now you are..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mr. X
unexpectedly spat blue fire in his face. The Koopa King stumbled back
while receiving several hard body blows, his room torched up. Bowser
taunted, luring his brother to advance across the seared black
Darkland crest rug, then- wham! Down crashed the chandelier. While
the glass was still flying, Bowser hobbled closer. He tasted blood,
all banged up, but X was more so, dazed under all that gold plated
metal..</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You..win,&rdquo;
X coughed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
offered a hand. &ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t too shabby at the end
though.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mr. X
latched on without hesitation. &ldquo;Eh I.. I wasn&rsquo;t thinking
with that burst of anger.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
one thing we got in common... Look, like you know the Mushroom folks
well, I know my guys. We&rsquo;d probably have your head if you&rsquo;d
tried to come back.&rdquo; There was a huge bang outside the room.
Bowser sighed, &ldquo;Scram and lemme deal with this.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">While X
was taking the developer exit he&rsquo;d put there- wait what?
..Bowser peeped out into the hall.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-King
Dad I know I&rsquo;m grounded but heads up!&rdquo; Lemmy hopped
around. &ldquo;Kamek heard a boss fight and authorized this!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The doors
were blown off by the battering ram, the crowd carrying it careening
through the inferno. Before Bowser could scream that he had
sprinklers for this, dazzling lights emerged from the charred chest
pile, stronger than Iggy&rsquo;s radioactive microwave meltdowns.
This time, instead of forcing them to quarantine an entire floor, a
jewel shattered and blew the roof off.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
anxious group rocketed across the desertic Bowser Valley. In control
of the beast of a vehicle after Peach passed out and they didn&rsquo;t
want to take chances, Luigi wasn&rsquo;t all there either in
actuality. His attention darted between the narrow barrierless lanes
and a crooked mirror, hoping he&rsquo;d see six glowing dots
somewhere following.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
have to shape up,&rdquo; he thought spontaneously. &ldquo;We want
Mario back without a lengthy fight.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Aww
man!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
final, Daisy.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
Sarasalandian rolled her eyes. &ldquo;...Nice ring by the way,
Peachy.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
princesses vis-&agrave;-vis, Daisy was allowed to hold Peach&rsquo;s
right hand in place, the first time they steadied, examining the
emerald and gold ring, large but gorgeous on her. Thankfully Toadette
broke the silence with a more astute observation.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Does
it have special properties?</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
slipped it off momentarily. &ldquo;-Considering I only fainted when
that dark star was released, empirically yes. If I hadn&rsquo;t pried
it from my father..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hardcore!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
smiled back to the only other princess she knew that was also a
friend. &ldquo;Yes, dear. Maybe it&rsquo;s over. Shall we.. see each
other more?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yeah!&quot;
Daisy leaned in, her response catching up to her. &quot;Wait. Like-&quot;
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-The
terrain went downhill, bumps and drop-offs jumbling them up. Not over
yet! Through the purple fog, Luigi got a glimpse of misspelled and
drooping signs, Koopa Troop activity, before the brakes locked up.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peeeach!&rdquo;
He swerved around lava puddles and solid volcanic boulders, the kart
tilting side to side.. &ldquo;E-brake???&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So
strapped down, Peach couldn&rsquo;t reach the levers before rolling
gates came up, their high speed forcing the monty moles at it to
burrow as they shot through the chains and barbed metal.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Five-o-clock?
No prob.&rdquo; The recruiter snapped shut his flip phone. &ldquo;Sorry
bout that. Don&rsquo;t fret here, this job makes us say &lsquo;</font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">hell</font></em>
<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">yeah&rsquo;,
haha. You&rsquo;ll see..&rdquo; The recruiter opened the sentient,
and visibly skeptical, Dorguy with alacrity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The rookie
went in on his own, pointing and firing a finger gun at his head.
Away from the Twygz, weaving through the deepest darkest cavern in
the universe, there was no getting out of this. He&rsquo;d sorta
developed a phobia for water anyway, and to be fair, he looked like
the sort of guy he always wanted to be, snazzy in a pin striped suit
and a pair of prescription glasses that wouldn&rsquo;t fall off all
the time. The d-man entered a torch lit, gothic all black alcazar
with wild chomps in the backyard, home of some office space where
he'd have to behave at least sixty percent less like a psychopath
than he was used to. He got his cubicle, his stack of soul records to
organize, was almost shown the bathroom-</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">--Visitor
for accountant Sue Jr.&rsquo; the intercom played.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Stomping
down the long flight again, the one waiting for him at the bottom
snatched his arms, spun him around and had him pinned against the
building. Dang, that wasn't okay just cause they were in the game
over realm.. And especially not from your own brother!</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
embedded an interdimensional tracker on you.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Face
squashed against rock, Zoo managed, &ldquo;Yeah but how&rsquo;d you
get in, Drew?!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It
is easy to transcend when you have an extra life generator,&rdquo;
Prof. X-Naut informed, standing next to the swirling vortex. The sort
of jugs ferry drivers had were stacked there too, filled with purple
Twygz water.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo pushed
Dr. Toad back into that, the clash allowing him to skip out of there
with their own portal. Yeah, why lose out on that extra forty?</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoom! The
scholar&rsquo;s priceless scrolls slipped away into space. &ldquo;Sloweth
down!&rdquo; she scolded.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">If
accurate communication was the cornerstone of advanced civilization,
inaccurate was the wrecking ball. Ludwig would rather be hit by such,
no matter how much carnage it&rsquo;d inflict on his delicate winged
body, than deal with these sages. From a disappointingly pedestrian
Overthere pantheon, if they weren&rsquo;t the initial spotters of
Rosalina&rsquo;s pilotless Observatory drifting just outside a
dimensional door, they'd have been kicked into a black hole by now.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
display flickered severe warnings upon boarding, and their splitting
up to the engine room, garden, etc, sapped what power lingered. With
Toadsworth&rsquo;s assistance, the mechanical parts so antediluvian
he was vaguely familiar, it was up again. With rousing celebration
the center beacon was a dim orange, the auto throttle gently pushing
them towards Star Temple.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Countless
galaxies strolled past without an iota of the diverse star beings
Ludwig found on his initial journey. He kept searching from high up,
desperate to prove his fears wrong until noxious space gas knocked
him out, no one catching him. Fine, he was being a Philistine
threatening to burn those scrolls.. Anyway, the Temple&rsquo;s
protective bubble beyond the bars was hazy, the fields were scorched
away, and the sanctuary rusted copper orange.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Twink
wearily watched the nimbis skirt about, lose interest and depart. &ldquo;I
held down the fort. I guess. But there's another problem.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadsworth
stopped for him. &ldquo;Hm?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
was horrified watching Millennium Star&rsquo;s fight on that ship.
Now I can only think there was something funny about it.&quot;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Is
rolling up &lsquo;gangsta style&rsquo; another way to say &lsquo;late&rsquo;?&rdquo;
the ancient star quipped after they&rsquo;d reached the goddess in
teal at an intermediate point.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Not even
brandishing the finest armor protected the star warrior &#9825;&#9834;!?
, or &lsquo;Geno&rsquo; from that slap. &ldquo;Sure you beat us, but
you ain&rsquo;t done a thang. Are you who you say you are?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Millennium
Star revealed his Band of Casualty, a colossal infinity shaped
specter representing cycles of time, spanning to each edge of the
universe. Rosalina&rsquo;s colors drained, her elliptical past woven
in that somewhere, but Geno was satisfied, forcibly pressing the
ancient one onwards.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Come
on then, fool. You won&rsquo;t believe what&rsquo;s up.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Rosalina
swore she caught the Millennium Star muttering he would.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A sentient
parasitic planetoid, Doomstar Galaxy, swiped by the Moon without
meddling with that. It was already full of organic and inorganic
material from Earth, sorted aside so that its physiognomy was
revealed. Flames from the core flit between closed eyelids, and sharp
teeth stuck out of a mouth, black acidic material oozing between. The
monochrome star, Dark Ztar relaxed in a La-Z-Boy stationed at a peak,
ordering around smaller, equally repugnant bearings: Munchztar a
corpulent, murky brown shoveler, Skeptiztar, glossy onyx and
meticulously crafting, and Camoztar, gold plated and in everyone&rsquo;s
way from being introduced moments before. They scattered as a lilac
diamond shaped proponent of prudence, Parallelogon stormed onto the
scene.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Explain
yourself, Villain!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Whom they
were actually speaking to, Rapscintillation came around from the dark
side of Doomstar. &ldquo;I was trying to avoid this, Shapes!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Parallelogon
used the &lsquo;Peer of Truth&rsquo; on the adversary. Realizing it
was, they bashfully cut it out. &ldquo;Well.. listen up! You will do
well to help me!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Rapscintillation
spat out the antenna pole they were using as a toothpick. &ldquo;I
COULD use a warm-up before it&rsquo;s your turn..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Jaydes,
how'd this happen?&ldquo; Geno growled, coming up. &ldquo;They're
more dangerous in cahoots than duking it out!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dark Ztar
left his steamy cup of tea on a nice glass stand and removed the
blanket from his lap- revealing a gatling gun. The primordial rivals
split apart before Geno could snatch either, leaving him in the
crosshairs. He held out a shield, the jets of dark matter pushing him
miles back and reflecting off, disintegrating anything in its path.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After that
influx, the star warrior bit his lip. This was not &lsquo;on lock&rsquo;
at all.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">In the
surge of flying shrapnel, Bowser tucked into his shell. His spikes
embedded into wet Darklandian soil, shortly buried by bricks. It was
over like that, not the worst castle collapse he&rsquo;d been in,
because he could tell the entire thing hadn&rsquo;t fallen. If it
had, the faint utterances of &lsquo;what happened&rsquo; would be far
more panicky than perplexed.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ugh..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
saw the whole thing, doofus.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-You??
Wait a sec.&rdquo; Bowser strenuously pushed against tons of
material.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Someone
pulled a few planks and boards away, partially inching into the
pocket he was in. &ldquo;Or just follow me&hellip;&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The King
burrowed out into the resulting ruckus from soggy, pajama wearing
troops. Well there it was, mostly, SNES Bowser Castle in a torrential
rainstorm, minus the roof and the top floors. Mario prepared for a
filibuster, a fit, or a fight, not for Bowser to drape a blackened
emblem flag over him and shoo him away.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
no you don't,&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;Bowser, I&rsquo;m sorta..
Effed up. Why&rsquo;d you rubber stamp this kidnap?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
just said it. I&rsquo;m bad with rejection, and I did a stupid.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
pulled the flag over his shoulders, tiredly walking beyond unaware
minions.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Now
you get it,&rdquo; Bowser briskly followed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what I
deserve when you flipped your world upside down for me, yet I haven&rsquo;t
even told anyone I love you-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
froze. &quot;Despite this.. I love you too.&rdquo; They embraced
briefly, enjoying each other&rsquo;s touch.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Alright.
Now go!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He slung
Mario towards the gates where he was surprised to see Yoshi and
Goombario already over there, backing up fearfully. A flat tire and
five blockades on the way to Castle Koopa had slowed the kart of
Luigi and co down, nonetheless they couldn&rsquo;t stop, gently
tapping with the bumper against the final, most interior iron gate.
Its slow swing open screeched like a banshee.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
Mario!!! And Luigi!!! And everyone else get them!!&rdquo; Koopa Troop
rallied, gathering clubs and sticks.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
slammed the lever into reverse, anything he&rsquo;d rehearsed
promptly tossed. &ldquo;Hop on the hood!!!&rdquo;<br/>
Mario and the
others flopped onto the slanted surface as they lurched backward.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Stop!!!&rdquo;
Bumped around by his minions, Bowser noticed where Mario and co were
going. &ldquo;-And watch out!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach,
Daisy, and Toadette were coated in ash. &ldquo;The volcano!&rdquo;
they cried.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
twisted from the lakitus about to spiny storm, lava so bright it
temporarily blinded him. He spun the wheel so that the enemies bashed
against the rear of the kart, pushing them. Yoshi, Poochy, and
Goombario climbed in, but another bursting tire shook Mario off.
Yoshi and Daisy held him as he dangled over the spoiler. Luigi
couldn&rsquo;t slow, he had to do the opposite.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Where's
the boost, princess?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;A-are
we gonna jump this?&quot; Daisy clicked her seat belt, one handed.
&quot;Yeah, go for it!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Wait,
what?&quot; Mario gasped.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hang
on tightly,&rdquo; Peach gave the turbo a firm click.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
rockets blasted fire, shooting the kart up the volcano and into the
air. They soared over the big Boo Moon, Mt. Koopatoa and the Badlands
shrinking below them. Everyone screamed, Toadette&rsquo;s in
particular beckoning a giant abductor to swoop by. Everyone hung from
a seat belt, the wheel, anything, precariously in the air.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><b>My
bad, guys.&rdquo;</b></font> 
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
thanked everyone in between his breaths. As long as Bucken-Berry
didn&rsquo;t fly them over any areas he hadn&rsquo;t annihilated, he
assumed might be in the clear&hellip;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Innocents
might be hurt, planets surrounding them swiss cheesed, yet
Parallelogon was left behind by Rapscintillation, wrapping around
Doomstar to zap her with bolts. While the atmosphere thickened from
loosened dirt and spray of acid, she kept moving. They switched to
their heavy artillery, an energy beam to slice at her, uprooting the
mounds, ships, bodies, all, sending them back into Earth&rsquo;s
orbit. Parallelogon was about to stop their chaotic frenzy when
Munchztar snuck up and spat stinging goop in their face.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hrrg!&rdquo;
Parallelogon brought out a longsword of light, lacerating Munchztar
in the middle. The Prudent one flung that dark star into the sun,
creating a heat surge that blew them onto Cheese Land, the only
planet around looking identical as it started. With cheddar dust in
the air, they saw a pure black outline in the midst. They tossed the
blade at Skeptiztar, the weapon caught with their palms.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~Thy
reign is abolished.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Their
aurora beam stabbed Parallelogon, channeling every event they&rsquo;d
missed since encapsulation. Death, torment and violence drilled their
brain out, limply rolling off the edible planet into a thick purple
and blue nebula.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Disappear.&rdquo;
The Great Eldstar&rsquo;s voice echoed. &ldquo;Nothing can redeem
you!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Parallelogon
fit themselves together, waddling towards His glow. &ldquo;Great
Master, reconsider...&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They would
never reach Camoztar&rsquo;s illusion, going in circles.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Meanwhile,
Doomstar cracked into four pieces to nimbly evade Rapscintillation,
easy when they stopped in the middle of battle, ears perked by the
whimpers of their eternal rival in that gas cloud over there. Slam!
The Doomstar parts converged with Rapscintillation in the center,
sealing them.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Take
that, bugger.&rdquo; Dark Ztar laid off the trigger, gloating cut
short when his arm was twisted painfully and the tip of a star rod
jabbed under his neck.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You&rsquo;re
under arrest! Where&rsquo;s the rest of.. Da faq??!-&rdquo; Geno dove
with him as Parallelogon shot out of the nebula with a short reserve
dagger.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No
one can.. Defeat them.. But.. me!&rdquo; The lilac star plunged it
into the seams of Doomstar, wedging it apart.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Rosalina
quickly bubbled Munchztar before they flanked anyone, and Camoztar in
their concealment. That left-</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~Implore,
please, of the fate of the Rosettas..&rdquo; the onyx star toyed. &ldquo;I

<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">know.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
goddess held firm against the phantasm, snapping up Skeptiztar too.
&ldquo;I am content, no thank you.&rdquo; She almost felt hopeful
about this, until noticing that Doomstar was too substantial to force
field. &ldquo;&#9825;&#9834;!? , someone else must handle that one.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The star
warrior continued to choke out Dark Ztar, turning to the Ancient One.
&ldquo;Milly, it&rsquo;s up to you!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It
is.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Millennium
Star zoomed almost unnecessarily fast over there, to the star
warrior, a dominance display. Whatever bro. He wasn&rsquo;t so
fragile to care right then. What Rosalina saw however&hellip;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser&rsquo;s
chest untightened. All the Koopa Troop could do was trickle off Mt.
Koopatoa and come on home.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dis
is so flipping weird.&rdquo; Roy suppressed his shivers in the rain,
too proud to ask Morton who&rsquo;d been wise enough to evacuate the
castle with a warm blanket, for a piece.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well,
what did we sneak into town for?&rdquo; Lemmy let them catch on.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ohmygosh!&rdquo;
Wendy cupped her mouth. &ldquo;That jewel?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dang!&rdquo;
Larry slipped between the older siblings. &ldquo;Tell me somebody
recorded it popping off!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy slyly
brought out a metal Recorder that, besides being a ticket to a Warp

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
rushed over. &ldquo;Okay, gather around and listen. It&rsquo;s about

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boss,
I respect ya but even I got limits.&rdquo; Sentry 11 led the way
across the drawbridge, sweeping many with him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
shoved ahead of the mob, standing between them and the open doors.
&ldquo;Disagree all you want, but it&rsquo;s trashed in there. Let&rsquo;s
take over a motel or somethin.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No
my Lord,&rdquo; Kamek hissed. &ldquo;The deplorable weather matches
our spirits when you're chummy with plumbers.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
rolled up. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take over super soon and we don&rsquo;t
like plumbers! Not even close!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His
siblings backed him up.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-But
to be honest there is other good guy stuff we like, so King Dad isn&rsquo;t
that weird.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Roy
thunked him. &quot;Way ta go.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
shrunk under the sudden negative attention and booing. As with a
Wheel of Death rehearsal though, he was in motion and had to commit,
besides it feeling like the right thing to do. &ldquo;Just being
honest! My troupe at Emerald Circus are mostly Mushroom people and
we&rsquo;re all cool. Roy, isn't your Koopa Ball coach a friendly
species?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
sunglasses wearer stepped off. &ldquo;Yeah but..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-And
Morton, who do you mail your fanzines to?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Anyone
that&rsquo;ll listen!.. Including the Mushroom Kingdom,&rdquo; he
volunteered impulsively.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Noooo!&rdquo;
Kamek exclaimed, Kammy weeping into his bosom.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy
and Wendy, aren&rsquo;t the people on that Princess Parlor Discord
thing a bunch of toads?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Correct,
Lemmy-sama, HOWEVER!&rdquo; The genius held a finger up, a little too
long. &rdquo;..Eh, well, we verified them irl. Everyone sent a photo
with a paper and a username.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">..Okay
that&rsquo;s a bit much, but-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Who
cares?&rdquo; Wendy folded her arms, walking off. &ldquo;So what some
are okay? So what if I own a life size poster of my celebrity crush,
Emerson Lake Toad, or Toad #23 from the Toadtanic rip-offs?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">How
old is he?&rdquo; Bowser cut in.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...19.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wait
a year.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">But
daddy!&rdquo; she bawled. &ldquo;..*sigh* Anyway, that&rsquo;s an
exception! If you agree, join the Wendy Menace. That&rsquo;s right,
I&rsquo;ve reclaimed that moniker.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
surprisingly got a bunch of followers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Pink on
pink warfare, Roy shoved her aside. &quot;Lemme clear dis up. My
coach n teammates are acquaintances ONLY. Pure business&rsquo;s how
it&rsquo;s gotta be with Mushroom brats.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
garnered a group of burlier or more elite troop, Morton, Sentry 11,
and whatever Hippity Hop counted as.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Guys!&quot;
Lemmy reasoned. &quot;Anybody&rsquo;s okay as long as they're good
people- which ANYONE can be.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With some
hesitance, another portion of the troop split to his side.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;None
of it is okay for any reason!!!&quot; Kammy squalled.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Enough
of this!&rdquo; Bowser&rsquo;s stomps shocked them into silence,
allowing Junior to inch up beyond the dense group.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Can
I get a line?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kamek
scooped him up, holding the tyke high over his head. &ldquo;Yes my
young whippersnapper, our most loyal who definitely has no enemy
friends, share your insight!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The baggy
eyed six year old yawned. &quot;Scoutmaster told me that Mushroom
people act like what we&rsquo;re acting like.. So.. Can I go to bed?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The child
hopped to the ground on his own in the silence, zombie walking into
the puddles filling the roofless castle.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;He's
so right.&quot; In the undetermined bunch, the young trooper was
staring at her boots when Larry gently bumped her elbow.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Coulda
told you that on the first day, Emery. Mouth of babes, yo.&rdquo;</font></p>

no way he&rsquo;s..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Millennium
Star hovered over the destroyer, jabbing a crowbar into a cross
section to aid Parallelogon&rsquo;s crazed tactics. Rapscintillation
burst Doomstar open from the inside, the evil planet&rsquo;s tortured
cries ear splitting, and didn&rsquo;t skip a beat, swirling up the
biggest dark matter ball they could muster to aim at Dark Ztar,
whether or not the star warrior was apprehending him.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
freaking did it!&rdquo; Suspect limp in his arms, it didn&rsquo;t
matter. Geno couldn&rsquo;t let go. &ldquo;Somebody do something!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Breaking
out of the daze, Parallelogon tackled the rival, the throw going wide
and spatting on the Band of Casualty. Taut silver film melted away,
frayed sections littering space, making it difficult to see.
Parallelogon and Rapscintillation bickered their way off the scene,
possibly by their voices fading. What Geno heard clearly was
Rosalina&rsquo;s gasp of pain. He whipped around. She was ghostly,
passing out, all of her force fields breaking. Heart in his throat,
he dropped Dark Ztar to lunge and catch her.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What&rsquo;s
it doing to her, Milly?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
will chase the rascals.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Geno
yanked Millennium Star right back. &ldquo;Slick, you set up this punk
reunion. Besides babysitting the Ouroboros, and you make Chaos. By
Higher Authorities power I detain you here.&rdquo; Rosalina over his
shoulder, he pressed his free palm into his forehead, spiritually
bonding the troublemaker to the zone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The way
Millennium Star glared, Geno would have chuckled in any other
circumstance. What, didn&rsquo;t think his BS would be called out by
a relatively young cadet, 250 as of last August?</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
will despise that.&rdquo; The ancient one made the bands drop towards
Earth like missiles, particularly towards the location said to be
Eldstar&rsquo;s favorite.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Milly sure
was a broken clock. The only reason the star warrior didn&rsquo;t
snap his neck is because he couldn&rsquo;t do it with one hand.</font></p>

Overthere resident Ludwig was &lsquo;righteous&rsquo;, their
terminology not his, enough to breach the pearly gates, yet there was
no forcing open the actual entrance into Star Temple. His forehead
rested against it as Toadsworth spammed the high tech doorbell with a
camera and the star kid cautiously watched.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hmph..
Perhaps the ship has something to help.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
brought his head up, eyes widening. &ldquo;It would be unwise to
check now, Samuel!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A white
light speed traveling triangle, a paper plane crashed into the center
of the Observatory, tearing the fabric of the roof with the tail,
wings scraping flat the terrace and the library, and the nose with
the extinguished beacon embedded in it plowing into the temple.
Furniture Twink recognized, some good stuff too, pieces from the
entertainment suite, flew out the back of the building, and the
plane&rsquo;s momentum dying, the tail end dropped. Everyone
dispersed in some random direction, sapphire cracking from impact.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sorry...&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Embarrassed,
Banktoad and other toads slid off the wing, followed by frantic Giant
Spear Guys. They detected the evil in the realm, at the Chief&rsquo;s
call tearing off part of the plane to fold into a smaller one. They
flew away, ditching the final evacuees, tiny dolphin and a limping
grimacing whomp.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Who&rsquo;s
in charge?&rdquo; the sergeant demanded. &ldquo;A prohibited distress
frequency lured us here, and now we might never leave!!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
Gods..-it&rsquo;s-&rdquo; Twink stuttered.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Waist high
in crushed granite, Ludwig answered brusquely. &ldquo;I am the
commander of these operations. Thanks to your serendipitous paper
missile, we have admission.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Not
for you, Ludwig.&rdquo; The sergeant chirked up, throwing a zapper in
the nimbi&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Freeze! Wings up.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He froze
on the temple&rsquo;s stairs, it so tense they could hear the roar of
a black hole that had to be miles away. &ldquo;-How do you recognize
me!?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
sound </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Deutsch</font></em>
<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">like the Toad
Brigade, and you&rsquo;re a nimbi that just ascended. Your halo&rsquo;s
crooked. It&rsquo;s incumbent I- &hellip;Hey, I said don&rsquo;t
move!!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Leck
mich am Arsch!&rdquo; Ludwig nudged the halo while scooping up a
leftover spearhead.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bang!
Followed by a ping of off a convex surface behind him, chipping
tarnished bronze. The red blotch growing on his white robe, speckling
opulent marble beneath him, Ludwig forced himself up the remaining
steps and shattered the security box with the last of his strength.
It sparked and buzzed spectacularly, the last thing he saw before the
spearhead slipped from his grasp and he hit the floor. He accepted
instantaneously, without regrets, that despite his effort to get to
this moment, it could be over here. Sacrificing on this level was the
closest he&rsquo;d ever gotten to being a king.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">May
I assist?&rdquo; The Captain crunched a bone, or something that made
the nimbi writhe.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Banktoad
pulled his uncle away by the back of his inmate uniform.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thank
you, he&rsquo;s dying!&rdquo; Nass cried, cradling Ludwig&rsquo;s
head.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So
not cool,&rdquo; the dolphin with them grumbled.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sergeant
Howie blinked. &ldquo;You talk??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And
I was the only Alderson that knew planets were spherical too, but
nooo, I had to be abducted with y&rsquo;all.&rdquo; Donald thought
over all of the stupidity he wouldn&rsquo;t have to endure anymore.
&ldquo;Actually. ~Thanks guys!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sobered,
the officer reached..for the radio. &ldquo;Requesting EMS.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
will get it ourselves.&rdquo; Toadsworth clamped over the officer&rsquo;s
stony hands, an old war grapple movement he didn&rsquo;t know he
remembered. &ldquo;Tut-tut. You started the emergency after all,
sir..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Those two
floating away into deep space, Twink, wanting the ground to swallow
him with all of the stress going on realized something. Taking that
jagged arrowhead when the toads weren&rsquo;t watching, he had to
enter Star Temple. There was no time for backup.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Awesome
idea, Weegee.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The green
plumber conjured a smile for Daisy, at least until he was dunked by a
surge of water. Bucken-Berry&rsquo;s monster form crossed the ocean,
everyone else on his back. Though wild and uncertain, waves choppy
and moonlight diminishing, they had each other, and this method beat
hanging onto an undrivable kart or plummeting from the sky.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
braved the spray and mist for a while. &ldquo;Blue, what&rsquo;s your
top speed?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><b>I&rsquo;m
a lil afraid to find out.&rdquo; </b></font>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Phew..&rdquo;
Yoshi held onto a fiercely yapping Poochy. Better the dog take a dip
in water than lava as his usual habit, regardless he wasn&rsquo;t
allowing it.<br/>
&ldquo;Can I test something?&rdquo; Goombario
asked. &ldquo;Ah hem. Yvan &lsquo;Bucken-Berry&rsquo; Kingpin Toad:

</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The paper
goomba blushed. &ldquo;It was considered cheating in college and
became more of a nervous tick for me than anything.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Over
what?&rdquo; Peach hesitated to venture.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario got
splashed hard from some object smacking the water, spitting out a
cheep cheep. Bucken-Berry snaked around more of the flaming debris,
smaller ones inescapably battering them like a heavy hailstorm.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Take
that!&rdquo; Luigi pointed one of his heads over. &ldquo;No you&rsquo;re
not imagining it!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The dragon
landed belly first on the apparitional highway, the rainbow road
arching over lofty green hills. Luigi forgot to warn about the
booster effect. The group were propelled through intense loops and
spirals over the indigo Star Hill craters and to Castle grounds where
it dumped them abruptly. The pink angled roof rapidly approaching,
Yoshi told the dragon to dive, gain speed, and quote &lsquo;pull up&rsquo;.
Positive g-forces squashed them down, the beast swooping low and then
high. He lopped off one spire of her castle and crashed into the
garden. Everyone was catapulted off into shrubbery and silver sand,
the by-product of the asteroids.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ingesting
the particles like dust, Luigi coughed, rolling to his side.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bae.&rdquo;
An old sounding man shook him in a nagging get the heck out of bed
way. Toad was liver spotted and wrinkly, his signature clothes
wearing him, almost obscuring the Vrlrdyi Scope in his pocket. &quot;I
don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s gone on, but we gotta get out of here.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
lifted, words dying from the array of silver globs suspended over
town, like a snapshot.</font></p>
<p><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~Do
you know what that was? It&rsquo;s what you see before you die. </font></em>

<p><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
meddled and you failed like the- I'm combing through your timeline..
the loser you always were, Luigi Mario. I am tired of the universe's

Chaos I once was, and nothing will ever be the same! </font></em>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Tears
streamed from his blackened, starry eyes, not from fear, but strain.
&quot;Maybe you're right in a way. And you can call me a loser too if
you want. Get this though,&quot; he spat to the anonymous foe. &quot;This
was by the seat of my pants, and I had to rely on every friend I
had..&quot; (Or was that all of them?) &quot;You've also threatened
the wrong 'loser' because I'm not giving up.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">From a
realm Time couldn't touch, the rapidly aging plumber was pulled into
the shadows.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;m
dead?&rdquo; He gawked at the puffy aerial landscape. Civilization
was layered as the clouds were, neatly, spotted by ancient courts,
strung by red doors and moving platforms. The population was dense,
many coming and going.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
don&rsquo;t know, and I say it matters not. Your vow as a public
servant is to protect no matter what.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The whomp
stalwartly faced the nimbi. &ldquo;Why I don&rsquo;t have sympathy
for enemies.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadsworth
thrust out a scroll from an Overthere library. &ldquo;I say, you
might be surprised what our people&rsquo;s original mission was.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sergeant
Howie unenthusiastically examined the weathered scroll. There weren&rsquo;t
many lines of twice translated Shroomish at all, jumping between time
periods, yet it detailed what he&rsquo;d never seen on Earth. The
tension in his forehead telegraphed his feelings.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">See?
Empathy does align you with the Mushroom spirit, pre-corruption.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
officer slapped that paper into his chest. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find a
doctor per my obligation, old man. That&rsquo;s it. Oh, here&rsquo;s
a lead.&rdquo; He brought out the zapper again to clear his way to
new arrivals, if by accident by their spaceship flattening sacred
apple trees. They were chasing some d-man on the loose, the agent
making the clouds darken, winds kick. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Not
like that!&rdquo; Toadsworth cried.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Climbing
up some withering vines, &lsquo;you can do it&rsquo;, the star kid
reassured himself. With the bars retracted over the windows, he could
shatter one high up and slip into a massive orrery room. He smashed
into the globe of one blue and green planet, was almost skewered by
additional spokes on the way down, and splat on the weathered tile
floor. This area split off to the dining room, utterly destroyed.
Supports had fallen, running portraits, tables and chairs, and other
valuables. On the way however, a cosmic chain on a prohibited room
piqued his interest. He&rsquo;d never seen anything like it, thorned,
too strong to snap.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Anyone
h-hear me?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Yes!
Help! Oh please help us!...&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">If
the Legendary Captain could be located, so can your daughter.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
are too kind Heinemann,..&rdquo; Out in the once Elysian fields, Nass
had just discontinued the chest compressions on Ludwig. &ldquo;Though,
that was the sort of lip service common with my old colleagues.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Understood.&rdquo;
The bespectacled toad&rsquo;s face fell. &ldquo;Perhaps neither of us
could easily return to our old professions, but it&rsquo;s too early
to toss away all prospects. ..Or I&rsquo;m simply optimistic.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She met
his gaze. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something else I-&ldquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Twink
sprung off the porch, tumbling between them. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s super
strong? I need them inside!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
Captain barreled over Twink, disappeared for a second, then crawled
back out, gagging.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There&rsquo;s
treasure in there, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Banktoad brought up.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mailtoad
bereaved himself of his prized satchel, tying some of the ripped
leather around The Captain&rsquo;s head as a blindfold. &ldquo;I,
umm, hope that&rsquo;ll work.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Soo-kh!&rdquo;
Banktoad ordered. That appeared to work, neither their captain nor
the star kid with footprints all over him returning. &ldquo;Great
job, Mail. No wonder Yellow crushes on you.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
postman slowly collected his letters, feeling himself flush. &ldquo;J&ouml;rg
mentioned that to you?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">To
Stanley in a dream invasion.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The purple
toad stood. &ldquo;..William. You&rsquo;d better not lie considering
where we are. Why&rsquo;d you let your uncle run you mad like this?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He&rsquo;s
subject to a lot of my intrusive thoughts, ministry boy.&rdquo; Bank
bumped him humoredly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all. What did Yellow
insinuate?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">More.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
won&rsquo;t say because I&rsquo;m a &lsquo;ministry boy&rsquo;. Ask
him.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Together
they faced where the yellow capped culprit might be, marked by his
snoring and the subtle bristle of the white field. Now the entire lot
was blown flat, the same force tipping the platform, flicking
everybody off the ground like a flea.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hate
to interrupt this requiem- naw, I bloody love to.&rdquo; Dark Ztar
laughed maniacally.</font></p>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Let&rsquo;s
resolve this.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He was
done absorbing the color inverted world, ghastly &lsquo;freaks&rsquo;
to most, but to him merely alternative forms on their daily business,
crossing signs and landmarks. Beyond the weeping willows and
tombstones, was Toad Town, except it wasn&rsquo;t.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
overdue.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He focused
squarely on Booigi on the curb. &ldquo;Yeah. That dream sequence went
off the rails. Now, I don&rsquo;t want us to hit a reset. We&rsquo;d
already done that when we met at the tennis game. I broke a promise,
and sent you to the slaughter but-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The boo&rsquo;s
eyes narrowed. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Concerned,
Luigi stopped against the newsstand, filled with Booish language
papers. &ldquo;Then-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
my fault and it&rsquo;s a good thing you didn&rsquo;t mess with me
earlier. I may have more regrets right now..&rdquo; Boo lightly spun
in their grasp the green Bowser racket, inflamed with the fury of
their ancestors. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to abate me with more
explanations. Just tell me what I need to do in the real world.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
breathed in, thinking it out. One glance up and.. &ldquo;Buddy, since
you want it truncated, you&rsquo;ll have to try it out in this one.&rdquo;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Halt!&rdquo;
Star Spirits shot out of the temple, using all of their forces, the
lullabies, star storms, chill outs, up &amp; away, the.. Actually not
the smooch, not that Misstar&rsquo;s hesitance appeared to matter.
Without Eldstar they could not star beam the fiend, only ruin their
home more. Observatory, plane, and temple separated, leaving the
sapphire to all fracture in pieces with whoever was on it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Twink hid
behind the paper remnants as long as he could, taking a thick phone
pole sized spear to whack it across the back of Dark Ztar&rsquo;s
head. While knocked forward, he recovered, grabbed the star kid and
punted him over the guardian&rsquo;s heads, demolishing the left half
of the temple.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Pick
on somebody your own size!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Don&rsquo;t
take the bait!-&rdquo; Klevar warned.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Muskular
and the crazed cousin arm wrestled, grunting.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
are a tough bastard! Not enough!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Shut
up, Zach. -Ah!&rdquo; The blue sailor hat wearing star spirit simply
hadn&rsquo;t the chance to warm up. The family cringed as Dark Ztar
slapped his hand against the ground so hard, he cracked through the
platform. In addition to the area becoming one big debris cloud,
their toughest, heaviest star was plunged into a black hole. The
family went silent, staring.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">For the
girl in a white flowy dress, having some fresh air couldn&rsquo;t
subside the dread in her. Odd geometries, vivid colors, unexpected
discoveries that came with traveling the cosmos- so captivating in
the past, now were pointed reminders of her displacement. She kicked
her legs off the edge of the ship's rounded sides, wondering how
she&rsquo;d admit this when the apricot luma returned.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Attention,
whatever scientific principles are at play here, submit to the Koopa
Empire, or you shall be skirting along to another planet!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The girl
staggered to her feet, the invader&rsquo;s mechanicalized pidget
carpet blocking her starshroom. There were koopas back home, never
that big and frightening. The stranger passed over a document as if
it was burning a hole in his hand, King Ludwig Von Koopa to be exact,
suited up in a navy jacket full of glimmering gold medals.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well?&rdquo;
He sighed. &ldquo;I should have left reconnaissance to King Roy and
the fighter jets.. Don&rsquo;t you know where you are?!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The girl
turned, seeing for the first time the world she hovered over. It was
blue and greenish, Earth ostensibly, but not one she belonged to. All
of the themed lands were free to embrace their original traditions.
She only wished she knew what any of this meant, especially the
strict order to &lsquo;eschew contemporary Mushroomy ideology&rsquo;.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Just as
King Ludwig was about to call reinforcements on this silly, probably
Mushroom aligned girl, a roof panel opened with a hiss and release of
mist.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig,
Rosalina, no time to explain. Wake up. You&rsquo;re dying!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">While
Ludwig didn&rsquo;t see the partner in crime, he heard him, accented
like him, and his late mother.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Where was
he? Where? Giving up, Millennium Star didn&rsquo;t want to look at
that Earth Geno was so didactic over. If by Eldstar&rsquo;s will,
seedy individuals must exist, why was he wrong to mold them into
tools?</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He was
jolted from those musings by a sting in the back. He narrowly avoided
the barrage of his Casualty bands lobbed into the air. The trick
shots that hit him didn&rsquo;t hurt as much as losing altitude, a
byproduct of his distracted acrobatics. He was being attacked by an
additional psionic source, and it terrified him.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi was
conscious of being dragged across Peach&rsquo;s lawn with a bloodied
nose, so he hadn&rsquo;t whittled to dust. Great, though with
everything in slow motion, he couldn&rsquo;t warn his friends of the
falling star. The impact was somewhere behind Peach&rsquo;s Castle,
but the shockwave normal, possibly triple speed. He was slung as far
as Royal Raceway, his vision going entirely fluorescent traffic cone
orange.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Emerging
from the coma-like state, he was too weak to thrash, reaching for the
closest thing. It was smooth, trying to slap him with a fin. Donald
looked at the nimbi crossly, caught on, and then kept swimming with
him. Tired of holding his breath, and lost in the scraps of paper and
indistinguishable pieces of the temple dispersed everywhere in space,
he could use the assistance. Ludwig was pointing his wing behind Dark
Ztar as he approached the shocked silent star guardians.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
monochrome star fired off an over the shoulder warning shot at the
d-Man fluttering over. Refitting his glasses, the agent of Queen
Jaydes wasn&rsquo;t deterred. Dark Ztar easily maneuvered from
whatever the d-man threw, whatever it was invisibly striking Eldstar
on the stretcher.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The elder
made the first groan he had since being secured, turning to his side,
choking up heaps of dark matter into the mist of the fields. That got
his family animated, rushing over to his side.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Nice
shot, bloke!&rdquo; Dark Ztar shook the blackened cretin&rsquo;s
hand. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never shaken me down before. Must be new.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
accountant nodded, sweat dripping from their heavy brow. &ldquo;Yeah.
Could use some side work tho.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Are
you more than fifty percent sane? If so brilliant.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dang
it. Never mind.&rdquo; He took the villain&rsquo;s card, slouched
over. &ldquo;Besides, I don't think that was my death ray. It was
missing that energizing aftermath. If anything I&rsquo;m depleted!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dark
Ztar&rsquo;s smile dropped like rock, swiveling around. The epitome
of fairness, Eldstar, stood with some support, soft features twisting
in disappointment.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Tongue
tied now? Zoo Diddley learned how to Refresh from your conspirator,
Zachary.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">N-no.
He..&rdquo; Dark Ztar stumbled backwards, monocle swinging from his
face. &ldquo;He ruined me!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Who?
That one?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A saucer
shaped spaceship zipped by, commotion visible from the curved visor
window. The whomp fought with Prof. X-Naut over ray guns, Dr. Toad
and Toadsworth fussed over controls, and Johnson on crutches could do
little but flick on the tractor beam for Zoo and the other
stragglers.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-No,
I meant. Milly!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His
comeuppance has come, Zachary. Here is something you cannot deflect
for once,&rdquo; Eldstar declared, voice strong.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
monochrome star obtained color from the holy white light beam above,
stamping him through the last sapphire slab. The black hole spat out
Muskular as gravity shifted. He grabbed Dark Ztar in his dazed state
and pile drove him into the void, where it collapsed onto itself. The
wicked star&rsquo;s screams faded before the light dissipated, and
the cleansed temple, what tiny bit remained floating in space, began
to sparkle and shine. Simultaneously, the Observatory&rsquo;s beacon
reignited above their heads, turning right side up.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Geno
resolved to get here and destroy evil if it was the last thing he
did. He didn&rsquo;t expect Rosalina to spring to life in his arms
when the sanctuary was in sight, or gracefully rise, eyes closed, to
her station.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Eldstar
yelled upwards. &ldquo;I am sorry, my dear. Every bit will be sorted.
Come back!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Geno was
dumbstruck. He did nothing.</font></p>

<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Chirping
birds and patchy light gently coaxed the man under the tree to stand
up. Dizzily, he abandoned the crumbled traffic cone, leaving dew
covered grass for the paved, slightly sloped downwards raceway. The
electronic banner tacked to the banisters stated the temperature, a
tire advert, and the date. For the first time ever, he thanked God it
was Monday.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">In Toad
Town there were karts passing by, and foot traffic on the sidewalks.
No riots, nothing burned down. North at Peach&rsquo;s Castle, he grew
less anesthetic. The four-hundred year old stronghold was sturdy,
beautiful and vibrant, not a sandstone tile on the ground path even
cracked, but behind it.. He fought off that bout of faintness, the
sound of a motorcycle drowning out his thoughts.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Did
you sleep out here? No wonder..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
looked him over funny while looking funny. Or, he wore casual clothes
on at least, sans the boots, which he&rsquo;d never not wear.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi kept
it to, &ldquo;I always was a star gazer..&rdquo;<br/>
He accepted
Mario&rsquo;s burnt toast, the older brother not about to take him
anywhere on the Mach Bike than towards the castle. Luigi crunched on
it without complaint. Star Hill, holy grounds of the Mushroom
Kingdom, wasn&rsquo;t on the horizon.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The indigo
rocky landscape held a new secret. The vent previously spewing an
unlimited supply of starbits was plugged by an eldritch five pointed
being. No one could get close enough to look at it directly. That&rsquo;s
all they knew down at the star summit path gate via a drone a toad
flew up there. And a Lakitu Bro that almost died earlier. Late to the
party, Luigi didn&rsquo;t want to instigate. What if he said the
wrong thing and willed one of them out of existence again?</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He did
have one safe question for the princess, in a tank top and shorts.
&ldquo;What do you think your dad thinks about this?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
remained as calm as one could. &quot;I imagine he&rsquo;s more
worried about protecting his old factory with a single sword.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Don&rsquo;t

settled for using her words after communicating more than she needed
to by bumping dozens of the wooden traffic rerouting barrels.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jr. Troopa
leered into her car. His face mask wasn&rsquo;t all that fearsome,
but the light blue smock actually showed off his arms, and she&rsquo;d
better heed that. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re Mecha-Yoshi lanes.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Troopa,

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jackson.

off, leaving him with the next one on foot.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Are
you taking applications? I&rsquo;ll live here soon,&rdquo; The ruddy
dark spotted toad had a low super posh tone, contrasting her baggy
traditional country clothing. She must have been dropped off by a bus
or something, those sneaky bastards. &ldquo;Imma marksman, when
drafts went out I held off my five bigger sisters, I'm trying to
learn guitar, and I got this, eh.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She opened
a brown leather messenger bag. Jr. Troopa was prepared for anything
but that.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">..Haha,
actually it catches Red Chomps in Neon Heights after a player has

<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The Lexus
proceeded to park far away from the prestigious Mushroom Kingdom East
hospital before venturing in, in case the reporter&rsquo;s mark had a
window room. At the automatic doors was a posted neon green sign:
&lsquo;All welcome including baddies.&rsquo; So nice, like the toad
lady greeting her on the way in. She had a hanging badge, marking
&lsquo;Mariam&rsquo; as a guide of sorts. Kylie avoided eye contact
with any others as reception desks, nurses pushing around carts, and
doctors. No matter how &lsquo;critical&rsquo; his condition was per
hearsay, he could have these folks probed for all she knew, double
checking her tin foil helmet under her signature cap.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
scammed a dang god.&rdquo; She shut the heavy door of room 444 behind
her, facing the patient on the bed steely. &ldquo;Millennium Star&rsquo;s
gonna suffer as long as you do.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The green
toad remained motionless, a plethora of computers tapped into him.
His body was intact at least, and expression peaceful. She hadn&rsquo;t
picked apart his prognosis papers yet.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Be
honest with me Mitch.&rdquo; She sat on the stool with a squeak.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on? ..Well, you should know that your
insurance lets me handle your crap. I took all of your research on
that star stuff, hear? Not to Dr. Toadley. Too close if you ever
patch yourself up.&rdquo; She made the stool spin as he lifted off
restlessly. Better skedaddle before one of five practitioners
assigned to this mysterious case walked in. &ldquo;This doc you&rsquo;ll
never touch. In fact, I barely can.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Finally,
I get cha. Packet received?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
are still forwarding shipments from the Special World branch, but..
Yes I see it was marked &lsquo;urgent urgent urgent god please look
at this stuff..&rsquo;&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Good.
Phew!..&rdquo; Her shell rested against the leather seat. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
be easier with a direct address.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There
isn&rsquo;t one here, making it ideal for a third facility.
Possibly.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She heard
the sounds of branches snapping. Dr. Toad was on the move, from the
bob-omb shaped alien landing pad, to the wide open stone and moss
covered ruins. His artist's eye was pleased, vibrant colors, flutters
so large he'd swore Morris hit them with a growth ray.. Oh but
following that ridiculous space journey, he had extras on board to
deal with, certainly not a great time to be micromanaged at that by
publicists.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Drew,

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No
you may not, yes you can, in theory, and there is never a moment when
I am unoccupied.&rdquo; The toad doctor stood against tall moai
figures. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lament if I appear flaky. Circumstances
have placed me in an ultra classified location and Mitch&rsquo;s
research on stars will fit right in with Mystery Land.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-I

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Overtaking
a Mushroom Bus full of tourists for Koopa Fortress, the bikers pulled
into their gravel driveway. Peach let them go, someone to go cruising
with, she said, without telling them who. The neighborhood was
tranquil, just what Luigi needed to wind down. While he&rsquo;d been
texting with a friend, Mario had been talking loudly on the phone,
with no subtlety regarding who.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser

their home.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What?&rdquo;</font></p>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Stepping
into the dark den, it was cleanish he estimated. He hadn&rsquo;t
tripped yet.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">By the
crunch, Mario had though, on his way to flick the light. &ldquo;With
the gang, you know, Yoshi and...Just to make a lot of the transitions
easier. Some tour agent wore me down before I picked you up. Said he
was promoted and we can use a private beach his company owns.
Probably a gimmick. His name was 'Sonny' after all, but who cares.
Yosh did vouch for him&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi hung
his hat up. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s more than palatable to me. Why&rsquo;d
you even ask?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
don&rsquo;t really know.&rdquo; Mario collapsed on the couch. &ldquo;Some
extreme sport didn&rsquo;t feel right. Definitely no racing or tennis
or anything. Something still active but scenic, conducive to
learning..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">All that
twirling of his goatee. Was there something he wasn&rsquo;t privy to
in this universe? &ldquo;Spit it out, Mario!&rdquo;</font></p>
