<p>The Lakitu Bro's film continued to roll…</p>

<p>"Don't you get it? NON-TOADS ARE NOTHING TO THEM!" Booigi II took their green Bowser racket, shrouded in a white glow, and smashed the podium to bits, the microphone ringing.</p>

<p>"-Freeze! You're under arrest! Drop that tennis racket!"</p>

<p>The boo narrowed their eyes as a red dot appeared on their chest, courtesy of the cop blocking their way. "Are you with them?"</p>

<p>"Positively as a sworn justice enforcer for Toad Town!"</p>

<p>Bam! Snifit Patrol became a fleeting twinkle in the sky to the fleeing spectators. In the corner of the boo's eye, a searingly bright light flew past. They turned to the far hedges on the property where a lone guard was firing erratically. Her backup ran over to send a concentrated flurry that ripped apart the land and chipped at the castle ruins. Booigi teleported to an old tree nearby and grabbed the trunk, making it intangible. A heavy iron cannon lodged in it crushed a group of guards. They bashed in the face the last one standing. As she crumpled to the ground, tanks were starting to roll in from the city and mar the lake shore with deep tracks. They fired red bullet bills, spiraling across castle grounds, with blinding smoke trails. After a flash of trepidation, the boo vanished to let the fire rain behind them, anything left standing up to the foot of Star Hill flattened. Booigi reappeared behind the closest tank to Royal Raceway, causing the last bullet shot to arc in the air and lock onto them again.</p>

<p>Guard after guard scurried from the tank, the last and largest struggling to squeeze out of the hatch. Booigi quirked an eyebrow as he begged for help, two seconds away from mince meat.</p>

<p>The explosion was felt for miles, a black plume on Toad Town's horizon. As debris and smoldering shrapnel settled, a dazed guard landed flat on his back, on the far side of the lake.</p>

<p>Booigi whispered over him, "I saved you for now, but your colleagues are going to blame, torture. And. Kill. You later."</p>

<p>Benedict rolled to his side in the mud, watching the boots of comrades trying to hunt the killer move in and out of the scope of his vision. He was yanked to his feet, or his knees at least by Jon.</p>

<p>"You're an idiot!" He let go, catching his breath as shrill radio calls filled the air. "What can they do with you now, eh?"</p>

<p>Ben pressed something into his mate's hand.</p>

<p>Jon watched Ben shuffle into the lake, water reaching his thighs, waist, shoulders, and head, followed by bubbles. Slapped out of that spell, Jon finally opened his sweaty palm. He held a dog tag.</p><hr />

<p>"Raven! Jim! It's not like that!" Wendy shouted in between her butterfly strokes toward the pontoon.</p>

<p>The group gawked, standing under a mast flag embroidered with a hammer bro hammer and an electric razor crossed in an x pattern, her commissioned design for the 'Adolescent Anti-Monarchy Faction'. The koopaling princess impetuously tangled herself with that club in middle school, enticed by their doctrine of 'aggressive self-expression'. She feared her subsequent transient association was probably about to catch up with her.</p>

<p>A goomba girl, a punk with spiky purple hair and facial piercings, gave Wendy room to climb aboard. Her astonishment quickly faded, glaring at her. "Gosh Wendy, you got us shook with these mixed signals. Your crew did this obviously, so don't cry to us now!"</p>

<p>The princess wrung the water from her strands of hair, whipping it back. "No way!"</p>

<p>"What? So this 'flood' isn't to drive us into your dad's clutches? Sure," added her boyfriend Jim, a boomerang bro in a trench coat and white trilby. This roused the other adolescents to murmur in favor.</p>

<p>"It's not! Look, I'm ready to spill the tea. Yeah I've been sitting pretty in Daddy's oppressive forces but.. That was just because an East wind was approaching. Progress. Everything's changed now!"</p>

<p>The punk goomba girl's lip curled. "You cereal?"</p>

<p>"It's totes gonna be great. Just play along with Daddy for a little longer while he builds his fortress or whatever, then the fun will begin. I'm cereal."</p>

<p>Wendy's blue eyes breezed over everyone in the boat, awaiting their response with bated breath.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>"Get us to the tower already, Johnson!"</p>

<p>"Aye aye, King Bowser!" The cadet fought to keep the ship, more akin to a rubber cataquack circling down a drain, heading for the tower. Waves broke over their tiny old boat, threatening to wash them away. If this was his demise, he'd still be ahead of most green koopa troopas who never got the honor of navigating their king anywhere, but at the same time he wanted to live to earn that elusive Koopa Troop pension someday, so he weighed on whether to 'accidentally' slip overboard until he had no choice. Bowser ran up to keep the wheel steady with him, just as a huge surge approached. Knocked away from the insurmountable forces of nature, the wheel snapped, leaving no one in control. Their boat smashed against another and another and soon a big pile-up of wounded vessels smashed the tower.</p>

<p>Crash! They were pelted with bricks, the ship lodging itself inside the tower.</p>

<p>"Yowch! Grrr. Everyone out of the way!" Bowser flung away the masonry burying him up to the neck and ordered everyone to on that dark musty exposed floor.</p>

<p>Web-filled corridors, mousers, and rusted chains piled around greeted the waterlogged minions spreading about, at least until toppling over from exhaustion. Bowser scanned over the chaotic sea, giving a start at a pontoon and kids surrounding his daughter on it.</p>

<p>"What is wrong, my son?" Kamek ran up just as Bowser was about to jump into the water.</p>

<p>He faced him while jabbing a sharp claw that way. "I gotta save my daughter from those losers!"</p>

<p>The magikoopa conjured up an iron three-block-high Bill Blaster. "Use this, Lord Bowser. Should a ship attempt to antagonize, we can pierce her soft walls, send smoke up her aft, and leave her sinking and hopeless!"</p>

<p>'Wow, Grandpa really hates whatever girl he's talking about', Bowser Junior thought before slipping to the upper chambers and away from this hectic, already miserable adult situation. The tyke shimmied past Ludwig, hustling down the damp steps against the flow.</p>

<p>"Vater-" He cleared his throat a few times. "I'm.. ready to resume command.. Is she.. still in peril?"</p>

<p>Bowser held up the cannon to see through the scope attached to the side. "Not anymore. Light the fuse when I'm ready...Aim."</p>

<p>"DADDY!" Wendy shouted through a megaphone. "We're all totes cool now."</p>

<p>"-FIRE- wha huh?.." The cannon smashed his toes. "AHHH!"</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Within the newly christened Bowser Tower, minions zipped to and fro on its fifty floors. They'd covered up the big hole they made in a wall, and used higher and drier floors to furnish rooms with scavenged amenities, repair things, and establish quarters.</p>

<p>"..Yes Daddy, they've told all of our five million online friends about how great you are and gave you five stars on Welp dot com."</p>

<p>As Wendy's friends cheered and used an annoying blowhorn, Bowser let his dumbphone load the reviews. 'Bowser Castle 444 Dark Drive' shot up from 1.5 to 4.7 stars in the past hour, a historic record and only a point shy of Peach's Castle, and his face heated up, but that was more from Mario's instant message popping up.</p>

<p>"Yaaaas! I'm excited too and they're gonna vote for me to join the cabinet in Neo Bowser City!"</p>

<p>Bowser put the phone away, straightening up. "No voting solicitation... SEND THEM TO OUR NEW DUNGEON!"</p>

<p>Soldiers scooped them away, causing the distaff koopaling to drop to the floor and scream in protest.</p>

<p>Bowser covered his ears. "We're supposed to be on vacation, Babydoll. Relax about stuff like that!"</p>

<p>"Interesting," she began, propped up on one elbow. "So we're not moving forever? Either way are you going to delegate or what?"</p>

<p>"Or what? Ludwig's back and thank freaking goodness! That's his job!"</p>

<p>The koopaling princess stood. "But look at him!"</p>

<p>Bowser swung his gaze over the busy scene and found him immediately. The commander was aware he appeared suspect, his attempt to partially tunk into his shell, revealing only his messy hair, furrowing eyebrows, and tired eyes not hiding it well, though he was hoping that the guise would last at least until the flood receded.</p>

<p>"Besides my contagion, I am well enough, Vater."</p>

<p>"Hmph!" On her way to stomp up some stairs, Wendy brushed him hard, sending him flying like a thwomp tackled him. An older minion in the soggy lower room, Thwomp #3, appropriately was the first hard immovable object he fit.</p>

<p>"Sorry," he grunted, starting to inch away.</p>

<p>"You are excused." Ludwig steadied himself with one of the rusty hanging ceiling chains, "For the first time in my career, I have just decided that using a 'sick day' would be appropriate. In the meantime, refer please to my dear sister Wendy O."</p>

<p>"WHAT?" Thwomp #3, Bowser, Wendy, and Lemmy the latest arrival from the rooftop, gasped.</p><hr />

<p>
  <em>~Anything she wants! Anything she wants!</em>
</p>

<p>
  <em>Anything she needs, I'll give you the keys</em>
</p>

<p>
  <em>What she says you know I'll do, that's my gift to you!~</em>
</p>

<p>When Bridget cut the music down her passenger flushed, fearing 'Shackled' by the Pizzas was about to be ejected.</p>

<p>"-Yep. That's the fifth speed trap." Bridget shifted the B-Dasher down a gear, taking an adjacent street. "Are these cops for real?"</p>

<p>"Some of this was a little before I moved here, but Snifit Patrol was from a group of individuals wanting to protect the city like the Mario brothers, except without the decree. I never questioned why we play along until now... I guess it makes us feel secure?"</p>

<p>"I wasn't even going there, but interesting theory eh. I think it's more about having a free pass."</p>

<p>Toadette leaned up in her seat. "-I don't understand how that relates."</p>

<p>"If we have a single point of authority, that person can be blamed for leading us wrong. Whatever that Snifit Patrol misses must be okay. If someone calls it out we're just toads after all, haha.."</p>

<p>Toadette resisted voicing how severely she disagreed, mostly because that guard's wide smile was so infectious. She even answered her questions about various shops and landmarks around town with eagerness. Having a fresh ear, someone who wouldn't shut a door in her face, throw an egg, or else, felt exhilarating. Very shortly, it was time to test the power of the 80s rock song playing, infamous for it's subliminal messaging.</p>

<p>"..So, that's why Mushroomites began to call their failed anti-air flagpole explosives fireworks and that explanation stuck. Could I stop over at the precinct, by the way? I have to pick up something." Her smile was duller as she was just learning today, but she hoped it worked.</p>

<p>Bridget checked a watch. "Yeah whatever."</p>

<p>As they parked, Sergeant Howie waddled across the lot, heavy keys swinging at his waist. Toadette hopped out to intercept him.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Officer."</p>

<p>He spun from his shuttle. "What cha need?!"</p>

<p>"I-I was authorized to retrieve-"</p>

<p>"C'mon then!" The grumbling whomp let her into the basic office, with worn if well-kept furnishings, a computer with a CRT, metal lock boxes, a snack machine that someone was bothering to keep well stocked, and a hallway that led to the cells. She asked for the Princess's parcel in the evidence cubby.</p>

<p>"Forgot about that.." Sgt. Howie pulled up his belt. "We lost some pages to the wind. Is what it is."</p>

<p>Toadette was well aware of that after a thumb through, closing it up quickly to preserve her princess's privacy. "Thank you."</p>

<p>"Do ya want this too? He's not wanted anymore."</p>

<p>She paled when he showed her a black bag wrapped and marked 'Zoo S. Diddley'.</p>

<p>"But- he's.."</p>

<p>He sighed. "You know how papers are with their scattered synopses. We never had DNA or a living witness. Thank the stars he left or it'd had been a ton of work! He only got Bowser Freaks anyway, including that ex-one that was a bus driver. Sucks to suck sometime."</p>

<p>She rolled her eyes at his brazen words while being pushed out of the station. In the B-Dasher again, she texted Bucken-Berry about Zoo's belongings, hiding it from the guard with the big purse. He wanted to check it out after some back and forth, probably thinking it was some morbid serial killer memorabilia, though if she couldn't get a ride down it wouldn't matter. They were heading west to Pleasant Path, so she wasn't sure how she was about to stall again, rewinding the tape for the fourth play.</p><hr />

<p>Peach felt the span of her holding space, ungloved fingers gliding over jagged bricks. By estimate, it was half the size of the gaudy waiting room Bowser's Castle had. Add to that colder, grimier, and gloomier. She slid down to the floor, somberly facing the other occupant.</p>

<p>"Don't worry about me, Princess."</p>

<p>"You were absolutely frigid to the touch!"</p>

<p>"I know and it's quite alright. Tell me, what did you encounter in the fields? Before the waters came?"</p>

<p>"So many things. Which?"</p>

<p>"Only you know that."</p>

<p>She held her head, shaking it. "You are speaking in riddles, Toadsworth! You cannot be well."</p>

<p>He hated frightening her by interrogating or flinching when she got too close, but he found her just as irritatingly clammy. If one star interaction was why his pallor was deathly, another was why she faintly glowed.</p>

<p>"Every fragile relic out there has to be ruined now. Please, why does it matter?"</p>

<p>The old mushroom held his response as someone with rainbow hair whipped by the dungeon door. "That remains to be seen..."</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Lemmy marched up the cramped stairwell in a reverie. First Iggy was giving him the stink eye, now Ludwig let Wendy take president? He meant precedence.. He couldn't be her secretary, not because she was 'a girl' as was Roy and Morton's reasoning, or a 'grifter' as Larry said, whatever that meant, or because 'I don't know' as was Junior's statement made maybe regarding that maybe life in general. She wasn't a great student of Kingly Law because of its 'archaic' name and her go-getter ways got her in trouble all of the time. Okay, maybe there was a touch of his brothers' rhetoric in Lemmy's thoughts on the matter, but either way, the already topsy-turvy day had been flipped on a new kind of axis no one had discovered yet.</p>

<p>He entered the high floor where their bedrooms would be. At the moment it held some damp gross mattress and a random assortment of belongings that belonged to one of the eight, though so destroyed it was hard to distinguish who. More clearly, that lumpy thing in the corner used to be Lemmy's inflatable play house, so he collapsed on top of that.</p>

<p>"-Piss off, Mort!" Larry scooted away his gamer chair, weaving through the maze of junk.</p>

<p>"I am thinking about your downfall. Your doom. Your undoing, for conniving with Peach." Morton followed him. "Kammy said you were at her room for a long time!"</p>

<p>"Freakin what?!" Larry hit a wall then. "Don't listen to her! I ain't working with Peach."</p>

<p>"You asked a dozen minions where the dungeon key was."</p>

<p>"Since when are you the hall monitor? I was just tryin' ta.. score!"</p>

<p>Morton smugly leaned against some of the family's stacked chests. "Your behavior is painting a petulantly plain picture. And it doesn't rhyme!"</p>

<p>Larry was known for his bad win rate against Mario brothers and pals, outright forfeiting his World 1 fortress during the last pre-Peace Pact siege. He had to get out of this tight place somehow.</p>

<p>"You ain't making sense!"</p>

<p>Morton gave him a little room. "Yeah, got mixed up there L4rry."</p>

<p>He punched his shoulder. "-Don't overuse that and make it lame."</p>

<p>"Your music's already lame, cruddy, mainstream."</p>

<p>"Shut up!"</p>

<p>Well, whatever. That worked somehow.</p>

<p>"Guys, what's going on?" Lemmy stepped over.</p>

<p>Morton gave a stiff salute. "I was grilling this lameo traitor!"</p>

<p>"Traitor? I don't know about that other stuff, but Larry can be into whatever he wants. It's not a big deal, so leave him alone."</p>

<p>Both Morton and Larry pushed him out of the way. Lemmy tumbled over a few things and then out of the room in a ball until she smacked a crumbly old wall. He wanted fresh air anyway he decided, climbing to the rooftop where a mere hour ago he was optimistic and longing to see his crew again. Now he didn't recognize the location anymore or who was already up there. A backpack with a mechanical purr was strapped to the lanky koopaling, and the VR headset covered most of his face, and extra multicolored wires were popping out of it.</p>

<p>"-I have assimilated all idiosyncrasies of Ignatius H Koopa. Status at 70 percent of memories. Currently archiving footage of disastrous Koopa Ball tryout that birthed the embarrassing nickname of 'Icky Iggy' in High School. Awaiting further command."</p>

<p>Lemmy stared at the incidental patterns in the glossy stone tile. "I can't respond to that, but I'm sorry for not believing in your stuff earlier."</p>

<p>Ignatius Delta's shoulders rolled, some life seeping in. "Oh, hey, again. I just Alt Controlled so this is me. Yeah, everything was stressy and I get it."</p>

<p>"Are we okay again?"</p>

<p>"Sure, but-" He checked his calculator watch. "I'll help you deal with the Wendy Menace after I handle some business. Use this totally hyper-realistic decoy to cover for me. Laters."</p>

<p>"Iggy!"</p>

<p>Lemmy was blasted with smoke of Iggy Delta's pack rocking him off into the stratosphere. Coughing and fanning, he bumped into a projector on the ground, temporarily distorting the life-sized hologram of Iggy standing and grinning as if for a photo shoot. If they were okay, why wasn't he brought along? He snapped towards his own watch then and discovered that he hadn't scribbled a new minute hand. He rushed down to the 50th level for his dad's meeting, so late there was no space inside the room.</p><hr />

<p>"Where are they? These people run later than my sisters..." When she stopped the kart, the silence was loud enough for Toadette to gasp. "Really liked that tune, eh? Thought you'd be a rave girl, not a rocker."</p>

<p>Toadette giggled. "-Oh you know.."</p>

<p>"I'm joshing!" Bridget's arm remained around Toadette's headrest as she twisted around, looking for her buddies. They were at a flat, a few houses down from the Mario's residence. It had some highish grass and was modest for the prestigious area, but presentable overall. Toadette after all was a castle dweller, and before that one of many packed in highrise concrete coffins, so what did she know?</p>

<p>The pink toad settled in her seat. "May I ask you something?"</p>

<p>"I've been bugging you so far, so go for it. Hurry before these cringelords cramp my style though!"</p>

<p>"What is it like in Poshley Heights?"</p>

<p>"As stupidly affluent as they say. When people take their pure-bred poochies on a walk, they get to take a leak on a gold-paved street! A music fan like you would hate the scene there tho. Blokes like Bise live in the opera house, who should rebrand to.. whatever word means a bunch of hot air instead. Joining the King's service when I turned thirty was a mistake so don't do anything like that, eh." The guard faced her squarely. "Nothing happens. Most excitement I had was when we found the King in his chambers crying over his daughter-"</p>

<p>"Sup." The steely-eyed red boo's touch was gentle as he assisted the driver out of the kart, probably a little older than Bridget judging by the patches of gray in this beard stubble. "Sorry. Had a flat."</p>

<p>Toadette, whom Bridget excused away as being some 'city girl with directions', was further shocked by their brief kiss. The guard separated from the red boo and slapped him as two others arrived from behind the flat.</p>

<p>"Ow!"</p>

<p>"Don't get comfortable until you stop disappearing all the time, and not in a boo way. Trev, are you a secret agent or something? I don't get it."</p>

<p>The others, a goomba in a jade beanie and a vapor-spewing fuzzy, crowed at Trevor's expense, which he laughed off. "Cabbies are always getting caught up in bullcrap, girl. G-Man, show her what I got to make it up."</p>

<p>So these non-toads were.. Bridget's friends! If it was 'just a job' for the servants of Peach's father, could it be for the directors of the Jewelry Land Princess School? Could it be for her fellow staff? Could she be the weird one? Toadette was the precocious brainy girl who Peach adored. She had to have a <em>verisimilar</em> perspective. She had to!</p>

<p>The goomba unlatched a guitar-shaped hard case. Bridget ogled the instrument inside, a single-cut style with a burst finish on the flame maple top. The shiny chrome humbuckers, bridge, tailpiece, and tuners made the entire thing bling. Toadette quickly hid her matching expression by ducking in the kart. It was a Gibbons Lester P. Toad endorsement model that had to be worth many coins.</p>

<p>"Dude it's- it's sweet, just.. wasted on someone guitarded like me."</p>

<p>"Shut up and take the thing!" the goomba said.</p>

<p>"Alright, Goomfrey." She held it by the neck, strumming across the strings. "What's this finish called?"</p>

<p>"Dunno. Just picked a color you'd like, meork," the fuzzy rasped.</p>

<p>"Thanks Obed." She sat it in the case before she scratched it. "Who's house is this anyway?"</p>

<p>"My brother's shack." Goomfrey eyed a pink flamingo in the lawn with disdain. "He'll do anything to fit in with these bastards."</p>

<p>As he spoke, a green camo shy guy slithered onto the scene from the opposite sidewalk. He had binoculars and his rubbernecking made Trevor turn a deeper shade of red. Without hesitation, the guard fired a warning shot into the sky, scaring him along. Toadette shivered, unable to sink lower in the kart at that point.</p>

<p>The guard lifted the case. "Gotta go. Thanks for everything, but that ting at the castle's gotta be ending soon."</p>

<p>"Ugh, that?" Goomfrey appeared more sour, if possible. "Yeah, you better scram. Brother just texted. If he pays two thousand coins a month so he can be one of the 'good' ones, of course he'd attend-"</p>

<p>"-Get on with it man," Trevor cried.</p>

<p>"He heard screams or terror!" he went acerbicly. "People got spooked and ran him over a few times."</p>

<p>Bridget clicked her radio on and pressed it to her ear, giving a start. "..Yeah, let's bounce."</p>

<p>The three friends scattered in opposite directions like they'd heard a siren. Bridget slung the guitar into the B-Dasher backseat and slung them out of the neighborhood.</p>

<p>"Might as well tell ya. Some boo diddly turned our rep into a bunch of ice cubes and maimed a few of us with a tennis racket. They ran an ID on em and his or her name is Boo Diddley. I know. What a clown."</p>

<p>"Oh my gosh. They were involved when Mr. Luigi defeated Zoo," Toadette gasped. "What's made them flip I can't fathom, but in serendipity, the Mario brothers are just across the border. They can help!"</p>

<p>"I'm outta time." Bridget stopped at a red light (for once), checking her radio again. "They want us out searching, and they might need someone who targets practices religiously."</p>

<p>"You won't get in trouble, I promise. You can even leave me there. Please?" Toadette asked sweetly, scooting closer.</p>

<p>The guard adopted a particularly intense look of conflict. Toadette knew only one other person to hold that when trying to talk himself out of doing something dumb, and his version wasn't nearly as adorable.</p>

<p>"-Why can't you show me one more thing?" The guard veered them hard left and down a major southbound road, heading towards rural land. "Only a charmer like you would get me to bend so many bloody rules in a day! Thanks for trying to make this day cool."</p>

<p>The pink toad twirled around a pigtail as the city shrunk in the distance, cacti lining the roads of the hot desert. "I- well.. The same." She gave up trying to sound elegant, leaning over to give the guard a peck on the cheek.</p>

<p>"Dude. Chillax!" Bridget said huskily, blushing.</p>

<p>Toadette snapped out of it, tapping the pause button on the all-but-forgotten tape. She froze after, body devoid of a soul. How could she? -This toad had a license and a muscle car and was older and a musician, or purportedly, with dark spots as was her preference, while she featured a lot of the color pink which was apparently to Bridget's liking, and-</p>

<p>What point was she trying to make?</p>

<p>They were <em>'Shackled'</em> (Trademark)</p><hr />

<p>Bowser sat on his red and gold throne, dried out a few moments ago by diligent fire snake, hot foot, and fire chomp minions. The burnt spot was hidden by it being pushed against the wall..</p>

<p>"-Since we don't need to recap, here's where we're at: We continue what we were doing, all that depressing stuff relating to Friday, then once there's land to stand on build a fortress or two. I declare this Property of Bowser!"</p>

<p>Predictably he watched his minions glance around to each other, their uneasy visages obvious in the candlelight.</p>

<p>"It ain't gonna look good in one day! It didn't even take that in Dark Land! Get a better attitude or else!"</p>

<p>"Our folk's been there for centuries and it still looked like a dump. Good luck," Larry chuckled to himself.</p>

<p>Peach came forward. "Bowser, what does this mean for me?"</p>

<p>He grinned at her, baring his sharp teeth. "You ain't going nowhere!"</p>

<p>"This is against our agreement! You can't prolong this game!" Peach gasped, staggering back.</p>

<p>"We aren't playing games!" the crowd replied, celebrating like they'd won the Koopa Bowl.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Bowser checked outside a smallish triangular window, watching the waters recede from green peaks, odd structures of black or white stone planted on a few. He'd have to send some scouts to reconnoiter. They didn't need to crowd up his Bowser Tower forever. Any idle thought like that helped to keep that blasted Mario from bothering him, saying stuff like, 'Wherever you're hiding. We're gonna find you before Sunday.'</p>

<p>Yeah right. Of course, Bowser had gone too far now to use his original batch of excuses. In some alternate universe when this never happened, he and the plumber would probably be doing that laser tag thing right then. Somewhere in his shell were crumpled reservation tickets under the pseudonym 'FF'. He forgot what it was supposed to mean, 'Frenemies' something? Or was it 'Forever' something? It didn't matter anymore anyway.</p>

<p>Thanks to some self-realization and a wake-up call from his eldest son, he was committed to humbling Peach. Attacking her kingdom was his modus operandi as a Koopa King until the Peace Pact, but this had nothing to do with it. He'd never mess with her people again in fact. This was all about him and Peach and Mario.</p>

<p>A huge thump rippled through the tower, shaking down what little decorations he had. His copy of 'Pride and Prejudice', a giant old map, and the bust of his brother were flung off from the shelf, the latter rolling and spinning across the floor. Bowser chased it down quickly, picking it up and peering into the effigy. His castle's demise had reduced it to the shoulder up, and that incident further chipped a horn. As vexed as he was, all he could do was sit it back and hope no one else blew something up downstairs. His brother had loomed around in spirit since he began to reign in castles, and even without one at the moment, he wasn't about to break that trend.</p>

<p>A minion stood at the door with a letter. "Sir? Note from Prince Ludwig."</p>

<p>Bowser jerked it away from the koopatrol. It was mostly what he already knew. Ludwig was about to sail to the next kingdom and take a train to enjoy his sick day in peace. Being the professional, it featured an itinerary. He would visit a bookstore and the office of 'Authentic Restorations Inc.'</p>

<p>"...Why would he want to deal with that right now? He doesn't think I can do this?" Bowser ordered Tanner to call the minions to his room again. It was time to don some rainboots, slip on the rubber tubes, and get to work.</p><hr />

<p>"We'll just have to go on without the kid. Time is of the essence."</p>

<p>"Mario, you never met him properly, did you?" Luigi asked, keeping his arms folded.</p>

<p>"No. Why?"</p>

<p>He glanced away, not elaborating and Bucken-Berry wasn't going to take the slack. Thomas was a total loner, down to not keeping a phone. On that thought, he sent Toadette a text. Anything could be happening to his girl back in town since they last spoke. Trudging through wood-paneled hallways, the trio assumed they'd walk into a scene out of a drama, where the span between each beep of a surgical monitor increased, masked doctors crowded the operating table, maybe a defibrillator on standby, whether pertinent or not. Mario's pause got his heels stepped on, and then cleared the doorway, entering a plain room. One of their dear friends, with the tense disposition of someone enduring a nightmare, was being examined by a purple-clad toad. Dr. Topper and Dr. Toad stood back at a distance. No one was dressed for the job, the hammer bro displaying a rainbow spectrum with his coat and the toad devoid of one at all in favor of a trendy shirt, making it all revealingly impromptu.</p>

<p>"W-what's happening?" Luigi asked.</p>

<p>"This. I present-" He slipped up his long sleeves and rose his arms, from which a clear star with three more stars inside hovered from his fingertips, creating a brilliant light. "My Miracle Toadley Cure!"</p>

<p>"Use it."</p>

<p>Mario swiveled and the blue toad hurried out. "Cool Blue-"</p>

<p>"What's the problem? It's dangerous? Either way I don't need to be here do I?"</p>

<p>"Let him go.." Luigi said reluctantly, also considering what he'd gone through under the effects of that. "Is this safe?"</p>

<p>Dr. Topper tightened up his tie, specifically one he'd put on just for this confrontation. "It wouldn't hurt to adopt SOME professionalism here. We have the name already." He checked a clipboard. "Remind me of Mr. Toad's age? Fifty-three? Huh!...Sorry. He looks good. Well.. not right now but-"</p>

<p>Dr. Toad ripped the clipboard away. "We already know he's insured and has the mark checked for 'may resuscitate with highly experimental and dangerous medicine', John. That's not the problem."</p>

<p>Mario's gaze darted between Special World doctors with some suspicion. "Lay it on us. We can handle anything at this point."</p>

<p>"If you insist," Dr. Toad beamed. "The 'Mushroom Flu' is a colloquialism for any ailment from a fungal source. Without Dr. Mario's remarks, we do not conclusively know what species of fungi is responsible, assuming this is the same strand from his time. Fungus Up contains artificial mushrooms so that is irrelevant, and there are no surviving contaminated cans we know of. This is all a shot in the dark, but with your permission anything is possible."</p>

<p>The brothers huddled together. "Luigi, I trust your decision."</p>

<p>-That made one of them. Prof Gadd got mixed up in some strange sciences and now he could only hear from him when he sent a card on Festive Tree Day. If things got like that with his friend it'd kill him, but his condition was already doing that. He felt that he was picking between poisons.</p>

<p>Mario stood up from their huddle. "So?"</p>

<p>"..I can't say."</p>

<p>"I can. If I made it without it. He will," some stuffy-sounding person in a dark cloak croaked from outside the door.</p>

<p>"Excuse me? Who are you?"</p>

<p>"You'll see, Weegee. Do it. Doooo iiiiiiittt."</p>

<p>Dr. Toadley took that for an answer! "Hazzah!"</p>

<p>The energy from his palms blew everyone but Dr. Toad back, recording observations until Dr. Topper yanked him away by the coat. There was an additional, gentler gust in the room that flapped everyone's clothing as the ball of light dissipated over Toad's body, followed by his monitors firing up with activity.</p>

<p>"Is it an accelerated process? Yes it is."</p>

<p>"He has a 200 BPM heart rate," Toadley's intern burst into the room.</p>

<p>"-A very accelerated process."</p>

<p>Toad's eyes opened, bloodshot but with an unmissable spark behind them. "Did we win? Ha ha.." His soft laugh draped the room in solace. "You ain't leaving without me, are you? Guess who's back."</p>

<p>Luigi wiped some of his sweat away with a cloth. He only held back from hugging him because he knew he wouldn't let go. "You!"</p>

<p>"Did I throw hands in a dream or something? Sorry."</p>

<p>"I can't even feel it anymore." He still had the bruise on his shoulder. It hurt. "Rest up. I'm not sure if you can move too much."</p>

<p>"Can."</p>

<p>"Slow down! That's under contention."</p>

<p>"Better not be. Anyway, bucket!" he clarified.</p>

<p>They promptly gave Toad space as he vomited gallons of dark toxins into a tin bucket. Spectators watching from the window and door haphazardly left wide open hollered in celebration, or some pastiche of sort, for Mr. Toad Kinopio Toad, Earl of the Mushroom Kingdom was awake.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Bucken-Berry was wandering around when a slew of folks swept him away, into a lobby with La-Z-Boys and wagon wheels nailed to the walls and knickknacks his face was promptly smushed against. After a few more seconds, the bunch shifted on, allowing him to peel away and breathe again.</p>

<p>"They're exalting that inefficient Houdini as I predicted. He will need another day to create another, and unlike Morris, that joker must sleep at some point. By then we'll handle this in a more ORDERLY fashion," Dr. Toad fumed to himself, scribbling on a notepad. "Then they will haul me up in the air over and over, and I'll politely decline of course, because..."</p>

<p>"Hey." The blue toad tracked him down outside in the sun again. "I-it worked? Y'all fixed Toad?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Did you work for him?" He was eyed down by the taller blonde. "You make me less nervous than those Mario brothers, so you will pass this along will you?"</p>

<p>Bucken-Berry sourly accepted the paper, hastily written out procedure codes and else, signed by Dr. Drew L. Diddley.</p>

<p>The blue toad's unibrow scrunched in the center, the page crunching in his grip.</p>

<p>Where had he just heard that?</p>

<p>Where did he hear that?</p><hr />

<p>The koopa reporter turned to stone at the wheel, blew through a light by mistake next, and every guard vehicle that passed by stuck the fear of Eldstar in her. She didn't know where to start with what had unraveled before the eyes of thousands, soon to be more. Pulling up to her co-worker's condo off Pleasant Path, the Lexus was missing and the front door was slightly open. She propelled herself to his porch and found his living room in a mess. The sofa was flipped and papers were scattered on the hardwood floors.</p>

<p>"Mitch?!"</p>

<p>"I'm fine. Had to pay locksmiths to break me in," he said from behind a shut door. "I know what happened. Hold on."</p>

<p>Waiting, trying to be calm, she stared at a painting on a red-painted accent wall where they were two decades younger and on a beach in bathing suits. In the photo below, Mitch was younger, in the vest and white pants getup of any castle toad. She darkened, remembering how he was abruptly shut down at the very end, all over some extra 'gifts' he couldn't help having.</p>

<p>"Why would ya frame that with the happy memories?"</p>

<p>"...Oh that one. Kylie. Babe. It wasn't us riding our bikes around in high school solving mysteries that made me what I am now. It was that day. Anyway, I'm ready to see them."</p>

<p>The door opened, and the green toad wheeled out. He was as dreary as earlier, only in fresh attire. Kylie was bringing out a pen and a pad when she caught up with what he said. "Who?"</p>

<p>"Them. Respectfulness aside, Boo is literally a 'they'."</p>

<p>"I ain't here for that!" Kylie dismissed. "All I care about is that Boo's declared war. I don't know why!"</p>

<p>"Ask."</p>

<p>A shiver went through her spine, dropping the pen and paper as Boo drifted through the front wall. "Hello, Ms. Kylie. Mr. Mitch."</p>

<p>"-Boo, heh, hi fella! You have some, uh, valid concerns but-"</p>

<p>"What?! Have I said something wrong?! Huh? What part then!?" Booigi II screamed at her, showing the racket. The grip tape that once said 'Bowser' and later 'Zoo' had been scratched out in favor of two vertical lines. That was it. They continued with narrowing eyes, "I don't have time for diplomacy, Ms. Kylie. They encroached on us, so Eldstar's will, this is the time to extract the accountability out of them."</p>

<p>"This makes you no different than Zoo!"</p>

<p>"Wrong. Boo Diddley's cousin killed many. I won't kill again unless. I. Have. To."</p>

<p>Booigi II retreated into the shadows.</p><hr />

<p>Twenty minutes later, the door of the recovery room crept open, basically someone's empty if quiet and separate from the hoopla cabin. The patient was all caught up, and that was probably why he didn't have the pass to get out of there yet, even after promising that he'd only oversee the adventure, and not throw a punch or two at bad guys or anything. (Wink)</p>

<p>Two visitors, hand in hand sauntered in.</p>

<p>"-Hey Toadette, and.." He trailed as the pink toad broke out of the daze and severed the grasp. "Are you cutting out on Cool Blue now?"</p>

<p>Toadette stumbled closer. "Mr. Toad, oh my gosh no. I- Bridget and I … We... It was all for a ride here! I swear!"</p>

<p>"You gold digger!" the guard accused, cornering the stewardess.</p>

<p>"Hey!" Toad leaned up in bed. "Our homegirl's as a nerdy goof like you thought, just.. having some delayed college experiments. Speaking of goofs, you shouldn't be here anyway... Whatever, I won't snitch," he added, but only after he saw that she was mortified significantly. "Just hand this to your squad, and say it came from Parakarry or something from me. Just do it. It'll explain everything, including why some of us are going nuts."</p>

<p>She accepted with conspiratorial glee, scanning his 'story'. "Ookay... Huh. I'd never've thought!"</p>

<p>Worked every time. Every time. It was in fact a shame toadettes were so malleable around him, because...</p>

<p>Bridget folded away his decree, turning to Toadette and making her recoil. "I don't know how I let my eyes wander with you bein' such a basic b-"</p>

<p>She covered her ears. "Don't!"</p>

<p>"Brat! I was gonna say brat!"</p>

<p>"Oh..."</p>

<p>Bridget reared back a fist. "Actually I was gonna say cu-"</p>

<p>"-Homegirls, I didn't pay for the WWE Diva package, so don't give me a free show. What happened?"</p>

<p>Toadette's head dropped to her shoes before blurting, "...I used 'the tape' to get my way! The one with the cupid effect! I didn't know it'd work on both of us!"</p>

<p>Blam! The guard kicked the door off of its hinges, the object flying so far away it became one of many unidentified objects Southerners reported daily. "I've heard enough, creep. Cross me again and my foot will end up somewhere else!"</p>

<p>Toadette dejectedly stood in the frame. Toad was going to say something, maybe mention that Kinopio-Kun was back to being a sycophant again after one phone call, or that he was still needing some updates on the staff, or how he wasn't about to mourn the loss of Saul T., but he noticed a blue toad sprinting their way and he knew things were going to get ugly without any fuel he could add to the fire.</p><hr />

<p>Lemmy reached the 'dock' as they were calling it, actually the fifteenth level of the tower where the troop crashed into it and made an opening. The level had dropped so that water didn't flow freely, but all he had to do was look down, and a floor lower was a leaf raft and Ludwig, packed lightly, probably because it'd sink him. All of the minions were busy with something upstairs, so he had nothing to lose.</p>

<p>"Waaaaaait! Can I go with you?"</p>

<p>Ludwig craned up with stern critical eyes. "Are you sure?"</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>He lowered the scarf, smiling weakly. "I was hoping my trusted adjutant would ask!"</p>

<p>"Stooooop! What happened?"</p>

<p>The red and green plumber pried apart the toads in the lawn of Toad's cabin, utterly confounded.</p>

<p>Toadette clung to Mario. "I.. I.. I.. did something so.. lurid. I crushed on someone else and.. to make it worse.."</p>

<p>It wasn't his place to say this, but they just didn't have time. Bowser was somewhere out there behaving like a freight train, on an efficient schedule, impossible to stop quickly, and maybe even deadly to anyone who attempted.</p>

<p>"Was it a non-toad?" Luigi asked for him. Close enough to where Mario was going. The taboo came from some ancient apocryphal, claiming that there were no genders or any binary but 'fungi' and 'non-fungi'.</p>

<p>"No. She was."</p>

<p>She? Mario thought, colors draining.</p>

<p>"She was.. a King's officer! The one you all saw stomping away." Toadette cried, producing the cassette.</p>

<p>Bucken-Berry swiped it from her, boring into it in a maelstrom of rage and confusion. "Where the frick did you get this?!"</p>

<p>Luigi tilted his head to read it, frowning. "Mario? Oh, God, it was The Pizzas, 'Shackled'."</p>

<p>The red plumber hadn't fully shaken himself out of the first daze. "Cool Blue, how-"</p>

<p>"Me?! I didn't give freaking give it to her!"</p>

<p>"Please- don't," Luigi encouraged, staying back some. "Even if he did, Mario we both remember how, outside of unsubstantiated reports in the papers, the subliminal messages had no leverage on anyone not already lovestruck. If not, it'd been out of print then, long before MimiToo movements. Toadette.." He faced her worriedly. "The rest of us have seen that guard before, haven't we? She had ice cream or something?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that.. that was Bridget," she ground out. "I didn't get why it happened until now. I don't want to leave you, Blue. It's just that she was unrefined yet soigné, darker yet radiant, older yet teeming with youthfulness. -Oh and possessed a cool car. So.. she was my type."</p>

<p>Bucken-Berry was frozen in place before turning to the Mario bros, cracked into as many pieces as there were sand in the desert. "S-she- she's..never.."</p>

<p>Mario adjusted his cap. "Kids, I know it's painful to change the subject, but I have to know if anything besides that happened back in town."</p>

<p>Toadette burst out in tears, collapsing to her knees as she told them everything. Halfway through, Luigi whipped out his phone and excused himself, so panicked he smacked into the only Mushroom Bus stop in the south.</p>

<p>Mario sighed out. "-Okay. Stan can bring the castle staff down before. It's not a choice. I'm ordering it before they get wrapped up in that assassination stuff. You and Cool Blue, just give each other space. There's more than enough here, so I don't want to hear of another fight. "</p>

<p>"Whatever," the blue toad grunted.</p>

<p>"Yes sir. Umm, Blue, take this. I know it doesn't make this up." Toadette retrieved a small painting from her handbag.</p>

<p>The way 'Assimilation' trembled in his hands, they were certain he'd either snap it in half or fling it into Mt. Rugged, where it'd explode like a missile, but the signature on the back stunned that out of the toad. Suddenly his relationship woes were negligible after all. "Actually it does, babe. A little."</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>"She never wrote poetry for me like that, but you'd know that. I know she confide in you sometimes bro, platonicaly and all. Don't worry I was only ever slightly jealous.." He rambled, sitting in a lotus position on the cowhide rug, inside of a westernized hospital room of his friend with modern chilly ac pouring in. Everything was mixed up about the situation, yet it made more sense than anything beyond those four walls. "Where can I go from here man," he eventually settled on.</p>

<p>When he mustered up the courage to look the golden bedbound toad in the eyes, they weren't fixed forward and 'across the sea' like before, but he'd shifted his head to the left some.</p>

<p>Bucken-Berry unwaveringly followed the direction under the baking sun until his skin was red and his lips chapped, discovering a sequestered area even from the standards of the South. The big googie-style billboard stated 'Area 64', bordered by bulbs that were off given the time, and still wouldn't work at night because half were busted. Beyond that was a high silver water tower, and walking closer, something was weird about it.</p>

<p>"-Sorry, dawg. I heard about you and Toadette." A sagely figure appeared behind him, pulling off the hood and revealing a heavily bandaged but soft recognizable face.</p>

<p>He responded somewhat mutedly. "You're.. But how'd ya- "</p>

<p>She unraveled a part to reveal a bunch of red abrasions on the bronze skin. "This is from me getting dragged around," she laughed. "Not a flesh-eating disease or nothing. Dr. Toad said we can't tell anyone. It's gonna mess.. something up."</p>

<p>After a pause, Bucken-Berry punched a hole through the billboard.</p>

<p>"Gods. You okay?!"</p>

<p>"-Zoo got off on investigating his own crime and Dr. Toad's his brother! Drew's using that Dr. Mario's notes excuse to stay involved. Same principle. He doesn't care or knows about a cure already and isn't telling."</p>

<p>Daisy pulled her hood on again. "I.. well, I got over the bad mushrooms naturally. Something about my different diet-"</p>

<p>He beat his fist into his palm. "So we gotta do something before people kill over. We only have like five restaurants in town. Variety ain't our strength. Is that how the phrase goes?"</p><hr />

<p>The boo glided over the pieces of the Princess Mush IV statue scattered in the grass, the park abandoned. There were puffs of smoke dotted the skyline and boarded-up businesses. Their enemies were temporarily distracted by the rumor that the Earl of the kingdom wanted reunification, but soon they'd be back on the prowl, and boo would be ready. By the power of Eldstar, every single one of those toad oppressors would pay!</p>

<p>Unexpectedly there was a civilian visitor. Chuck's head remained on his shoulders only because he was holding Booigi's own phone, cracked and slightly melted, but operational and ringing with Ashley's Theme.</p>

<p>A glimmer of Boo Diddley resurfacing, the answered. "Luigi?"</p>

<p>"Boo? What's going on?"</p>

<p>Their eyes watered. "Luigi.. I'm sorry.. I.. all I remember is being so angry and lies and.."</p>

<p>"-You'd better be grateful that Toad trying some 5D chess tactics. Don't get into any more trouble until I can come home, okay? Bye."</p>

<p>The boo remained fixed on the black screen for a while, paralyzed.</p>

<p>"Not even trying to hide his bias.." The second brave soul was wheelchair-bound. The boo felt like a part of them knew his face, but the other didn't at all. "They're his kintype, most of his fan club."</p>

<p>Booigi slowly spun to him. "What?"</p>

<p>"Toads."</p>

<p>"Then.. why are you telling me this?"</p>

<p>"I'm a journalist," Mitch chuckled darkly. "I have to document the truth."</p><hr />

<p>Foggy mask and icicles in his eyelashes aside, there was a bad guy in his midst! The officer trapped in a sub-orbital launch armed his taser. "Halt! I hope you are staying on the straight and narrow!"</p>

<p>The menacing iron and flesh villain flying alongside him, or realistically just Iggy Delta broke his Super Koopa action hero pose to wave. "Nice electric behavioral correction rod, but no can do. I already picked evil genius as a career path Officer, so that might be a problem, hahaha."</p>

<p>"Let me read you your-" He realized he didn't have the card or citation book. "-Or I'll let cha by with a warning..." the snufit drawled. "Off the books, what are you doing young man?"</p>

<p>"With my enhanced abilities, now is the time to execute: Find Backstabbers Desu!"</p>

<p>"Who are they?"</p>

<p>Iggy stared at the blue and green swirls of the Earth below, sobering. "Sam and Slam, top math wizards in Koopa Kollege. After Lemmy got a job I was often ditched, and on a whim, they invited me along. It was fantastic! I got my first sun tan! We got into clubs Officer, and within six feet of attractive females- a personal best! But.. they started to turn on me. I felt it was karma for ignoring the red flags and other shady machinations."</p>

<p>"Let me tell you something," the officer went in this fatherly tone, like if they weren't flying in space he'd have sat the koopaling down for some straight talk. "I've had partners that put on a pretense, and others had a genuine passion for vigilantism but weren't assets overall, just the first three letters. It's hard to weed individuals out of your life when haven't always treated you unwell, or alternatively they treat everyone unwell except you, but it's worth it. Everyone I have now cares deep down. You should be upfront with your feelings and if you can't reconcile, I'll arrest them!"</p>

<p>"For me? ~Sugoku tanoshimi ni shiteiru!" He fist pumped. "Forget the physical property. If you tase them, make it over my dignity dipping into the critical zone!"</p>

<p>Snifit Patrol patted around his holster. "Yes indeedy! Just-"</p>

<p>He was already gone.</p>

<p>"-Be careful-"</p>

<p>….</p>

<p>Iggy Delta soared through the darkened tropical skies of the dolphin-shaped island, activating his X-ray vision. The coastal Delfino Plaza was a ghost town. Further inland natives could be seen huddling on the upper floors of buildings or under terraces to shelter from rain. He tuned in his hyper-sensitive audio capturing..</p>

<p>"I swam and swam, swimmingly out of the way brah, getting away from that 'stuff'!" some raccoon at a fruit stand said to a yoshi.</p>

<p>Iggy Delta reformulated and blasted off in a Westward location. Sunshine Airport was closed for weather, light rain beating on their runways. Ricco Harbor was also non-operational and stormy, with sinking or listing ships littering their coast. As he traveled closer to Sirena Beach the clouds grew exceptionally black and thick, the sunlight unable to penetrate. Dipping below, he only saw water up to the mountains. In disbelief, the cyborg dove closer, rescanning. He detected inorganic followed by organic material beneath him. Hotel Delfino, or parts of it, was there all along, with occupants. Frightened out of his shell, he poured all his computing resources into scanning for survivors, until a water spout caught him up, whipped him like a blender, and slung him towards the mountains. Landing in the supple wet soil embedded half of his body, the prominence of the friendship woes fading, and a Shōnen protagonist he was not..</p>

<p>Unearthing, his ocular sensors blared an alert towards an alcove. Someone was carrying around a bell! He fired five lasers on the spot.</p>

<p>"Yowch!" The bellhop dropped the molten brass object, blowing over and kissing his fingers. "Stop playing around and get in here! Weather's borked, mecha-koopaling brah. This is why we need more electric karts.."</p>

<p>"Whoops, I thought.. Well I agree Sensei, but.. Sorry."</p>

<p>The pianta wisely kept his distance as Iggy entered, flushing at the revelation that all he saw before was Hotel Delfino's old desk bell. There were others present, in various states of undress, a few with flashlights, spotted around or behind the lava stalagmites. Swoopers screeched distantly.</p>

<p>"Sam? Slam?" Iggy heard a whimper from far off and didn't need computer assistance to recognize it. At one party they almost broke their arm trying to wrestle with Roy. "I'm done standing aside while you abuse me and everyone else! Like Koru against the Super Plumbers, you will go down!"</p>

<p>"Aye! I submit! F'rgive me!" Slamondon crawled out of the darkness, making Iggy stagger back into a stalactite.</p>

<p>"-O-okay I do, but where's Sammy-sama?"</p>

<p>When he met his gaze slowly, Iggy knew. He shot out of the cave, and up into the unadulterated crest of the atmosphere. He had no direction on what to do or where the officer had drifted off to in the solar system.</p><hr />

<p>The noki kept his head down shrewdly, though spotting a certain group of scoundrels in the court was like the amber sun above peeking through the clouds..</p>

<p>"-Yeah that digital coin thing crashed, so my mom is working on my bail," Azul the blue, or mostly orange in the jumpsuit, shy guy said. "She'll only need a few hundred extra shifts at the Li'l Oink farm."</p>

<p>"-And your part'll be what?" snorted Dr. Terrace. The whomp's unbuttoned uniform was taut around his square back, and his tray was picked over, leaving the veggies. "They need garbage pickers I heard."</p>

<p>"No need, Terrace. I just came up with a MLM scheme. Y'all will be my downline right?"</p>

<p>"Could you elaborate a little dearie?" The elderly toad beside him mentioned cautiously. "What exactly are we selling?"</p>

<p>Azul drew out a long sigh. "A dream, grandma. I know you never sleep but the rest of us are familar. We're already locked up for conspiracy so no problems with double jeopardy. Are you in or not?" He slumped, arms folded coolly.</p>

<p>Dr. Terrace smirked. "Put me as a maybe, child. Whatdaya think, Nass?"</p>

<p>"-That we're getting distracted! Stop it!" Nass Toad was on the right of Dr. Terrace. Her black hair hung limp and oily, almost unrecognizable if not for her designer prescription glasses. "We are to focus on our 'mission' so we can confront Theodore first, second we track down my.. my daughter.." She teared up, prompting Mariam to pat her hand from the opposite side. She thanked the distaff toad, then hardened towards the men. "Capeesh?"</p>

<p>They nodded obediently.</p>

<p>"-Do you mind, doctors?" Jelectro slid onto the bench next to the older toad, '(Mariam?)' as he'd just bothered to learn.</p>

<p>Her face sparkled in recognition of that hot tourist visitor, while her friends rather aggressively ignored the noki, Terrace even munching on the vegetables to avoid conversation.</p>

<p>Jelectro dramatically uncovered the Couples Cake. "More for us, madam. I am thirty-five today!" Or close enough. Both raised their safety composite material sporks together and gave a toast with the paper water cups. "Bon appetit."</p>

<p>"Thank you, dearie."</p>

<p>She dug in alone, devouring the small cake in seconds. The noki resigned himself until there were crumbs left. He sorted through it with his spork, poking at a.. plastic knife within.</p>

<p>"Merde."</p>

<p>Amongst the watchmen outside the fence was the strollin' stu Agent 0088, his old civilian name lost in the sands of time, leering at the noki. Jelectro knew he was French, but he did not deserve this! He massaged his temple, gathering strength.</p>

<p>"-It's Zip Toad!" a guard squealed, using a passcode to open the floodgates to the outside world. That prompted troves to abandon their post and swarm the celebrity on the property outskirts, unseen by the public since three years ago.</p>

<p>Jelectro left the table with the pan. "Good luck doctors," he purred. With his rather compact nature and the abrupt lack of supervision, he closed in for a better view unhindered.</p>

<p>"Get back you animals!" the agent barked, whipping out a gun at them.</p>

<p>"Hey, didn't Zip T wrestle with Donkey Kong over a banana?" The guard revealed theirs from lunch. "Will you sign mine?"</p>

<p>As they crowded in, the blonde celebrity backed up until his foot dipped in the air. Pebbles dislodged by his sneakers rolled down the steep hill the jail sat on. Suddenly Zip T. tumbled backwards, whacking against a large boulder halfway down.</p>

<p>"Retrieve him, idiots!" radioed the senior officer from the look-out tower.</p>

<p>Her underlings scaled down the treacherous area, dreading the lawsuit certain to ensue. The first one there kneeled with the dazed celeb, whereupon their vision whited out for a second. Now a strollin' stu was in the spot of Zip T., banged up and bruised.</p>

<p>"Hey. Umm-"</p>

<p>"Dylan, behind you!" someone radioed back.</p>

<p>A torrent of orange inmates swept everyone away, scattering into the city. By the time the senior warden slid down from the watchtower, she was alone in the court, tables flipped and trays forgotten. She broke a glass box, retrieving the Squirt Gun Thing encased inside, and with a war cry leapt over a covered cake pan on the floor to hunt down some convicts.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>The silver pan lifted. Jelectro picked the lock in the offices to retrieve his binned items, changed into his normal getup, and leisurely took the nice pathway from the jail, blending in with tourists in the dense shopping district. If he followed the Keelhaul river, he'd find some help and do well overall. His only danger was someone wondering why the noki scuttling around was so wobbly, with a constant nosebleed.</p>

<p>"Here you go, sweetheart." A black ratty widebody sedan pulled over, the driver holding out a pink frilly tissue box. "Nice trick back there."</p>

<p>"You are welcome, Trevor."</p>

<p>The noki pressed the box into the red boo's face then bolted, cutting through a shady park, crunching on unraked leaves from last autumn. The coast seemed clear, but he knew better and spun to lace his attacker in the abdomen with the plastic knife, immediately after they emerged from the shadows. Blue blood glistened from Agent M's broken skin. Jelectro swiped under his Hawaiian shirt, but his experimental freeze gun was missing, allowing M to smash a mini practice amplifier over his head. Later the red boo would be delighted to find that it still worked, due to that Peavey durability.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>"You cannot park there, I dare say," warned the gentlemanly parking enforcer.</p>

<p>"Alright alright.." The steely-eyed illegal parker slammed down the trunk of his sedan before the toad came around and slapped a ticket on him. Shortly stuck at a railroad crossing, he checked himself out in the side mirror, feeling around his jaw. Despite the thickening stubble, a snorkel should fit properly.</p><hr />

<p>The rainbow haired koopaling shifted the stiff seats, wishing he brought his travel cushion. Without any entertainment, Lemmy had nothing much to do short of watching whatever was past the Riverside Station. Brown terrain adopted a steady gradient to green. Soon cultivated fields and asymmetrical classical homes with turrets and pastel colors were perceptible through the dusty glass.</p>

<p>"Can you tell me what's happening?" he asked exhaustedly.</p>

<p>"It's convoluted."</p>

<p>"Can you make it simple?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not."</p>

<p>Lemmy leaned on his elbows, almost dozing off until-</p>

<p>"-Thank you miss," Ludwig accepted his third wrapped protein bar from a maid passing by and scoffed it down. He almost ate a fourth, then caught himself, or caught Lemmy catching him and pocketed it instead.</p>

<p>Lemmy could have sworn he compared those things to experiments in Iggy's basement, so his appetite oddity was another to add to the pile. He willed himself to push it aside and make their getaway fun. Get pumped!</p>

<p>"-Are ya Luddy?.. Pumped I mean?" He leaned up. "This is where my troupe blew those snooty Cirque du Angry Solei jerks off the stage. Maybe we can check the venue out and toss a cabbage or two. Those stars suck!"</p>

<p>Ludwig faced him, through his topical hard clay Angry Sun mask. "What?!"</p>

<p>"-Only if you feel like it," Lemmy added.</p>

<p>"No no. I.. misheard." He cleared the scratchiness from his throat. "Might this be our stop?"</p>

<p>Actually, their stop was their snouts against dirty floors following that heavy bout of breaking. They snuck around a bob-omb buddy engineer by taking an emergency exit, slipping into the station where thick white pillars held up a high ceiling with intricate artwork, amplifying the clamor of the toads, bob-bomb, and bumpty walkers crowding at the revolving doors out.</p>

<p>Lemmy held up. "BRB."</p>

<p>"Lemmy!" Ludwig scanned for him unsuccessfully through the slits in his mask. He yanked it downwards some to read the monitors over the ticket station. Besides train schedules there was, to his horror, breaking news scrolling at the bottom.</p>

<p>
  <em>'LIVE Breaking news: King's representative murdered in Toad Town by Mushroomite. Mr. Toad revived from Mushroom Flu, informs King's servants of wishes to join the King's league again. The location of Bowser Koopa, abductor of Princess Peach as of Friday unknown. Analysts speculate on repercussions of Princess Daisy of Sarasaland being a victim of Bowser's attack…not that we care about her…(The writer of that portion is now fired)…Speaking of beauty ladies, you can find the Traveling Sisters downtown at..!'</em>
</p>

<p>Ludwig felt faint.</p>

<p>"Drink!" Someone nearly knocked him over, shoving a blue surgery slurpee drink into his face. Ludwig chugged half of it before he pushed the jumbo sized cup away from him. Lemmy gave him room then. "Better? What was that about?"</p>

<p>Ludwig winched through the brain freeze. "We must move on!"</p>

<p>The less showy outskirts was their aim, where the brick paved sidewalks were tepid by the afternoon sun and the clubs, shops, and inns were sparsely populated. Some citizens were on the streets with top hats, canes, clutch purses, or a poochy on a leash. Vehicles were rare, always cruising slowly if one appeared. A pedestrian overtaken by the curiosity of a koopaling and a 'clown' meandering around would step in their way with a 'pardon me' or such drivel, which Lemmy would expertly respond to with a 'talk to the hand' gesture. The shadows from the lamps stretched across the street by the time they made it to the first destination, so there would be no time to spare for Cirque du Angry Solei bashing.</p>

<p>"Will you pick up so and so for me? Good!" Ludwig passed over a thick leather wallet and hustled across a suspension bridge spanning a wide canal.</p>

<p>The granite auditorium for Conscientious Villainy stood behind the eighth flagpoles of each major kingdom, with an infamous flower arrangement of a Bowser Flag in the lawn. A magikoopa with a long silver goatee, followed by a slew of others carrying suitcases and carry-on bags filed outside the auditorium, the final one dropping his keys in the hands of the toad officers manning the door.</p>

<p>Ludwig grabbed a flagpole before he collapsed. "Don't.. close.. up. Please! I-" He let go, trudging closer. "Beg.. Of.. You!"</p>

<p>A more middle aged magikoopa at the back of the group broke off to approach the apoplectic guest. "How wonderful to see Prince Ludwig. We're only moving out for remodeling."</p>

<p>The commander crawled to his feet. "I don't care about you wussy imbeciles. Is the Authentic Restorations Inc. office here or not?"</p>

<p>"The owner abandoned his location." He stroked his beard. "I don't believe he told us where to."</p>

<p>"Try to believe!" Ludwig snatched him closer by the robe.</p>

<p>"W-well uh.. it-it might be somewhere unexpected! He was getting older and trying to retire from the replica making for desk jobs-"</p>

<p>Ludwig let him go, dropping to the ground again. The one koopa who 'died and lived again', albeit in a different way than he was dealing with, was somewhere he'd never find.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>"Wouldn't expect to see a koopaling here," the old hunched paratroopa said at the door.</p>

<p>"Oh, we're not attacking or anything! My Dad just doesn't like Peach. We've technically quit villainy and I work at the Emerald Circus."</p>

<p>"Interesting. I can see that."</p>

<p>Such a milquetoast observation felt great at the shaky point he was at, plus he didn't seem to be a supporter of the Cirque du Angry Solei, so double score! Lemmy sat down 'Rocks: What They Are and Where to Find Them'. Well, the owner knew where to find them, in the dusty bookstore. A window was boarded up and he could still see some sparkles in the carpet under it. They had a few picture books, but no magazines or hobbyist merchandise, so there was no reason to dawdle.</p>

<p>"Do you have Ex Spatio Obiecti Specialem Lexicon?"</p>

<p>"That?" The bookkeeper abruptly set a red book on a shelf, weaving around shelves to duck behind his desk up front.</p>

<p>Lemmy followed him. "Did I butcher or say something offensive in another language?"</p>

<p>The mature paratroopa reappeared with a green, ancient-looking book. "No. Don't you recognize me?" He adjusted his glasses. "I was the postmaster in Toad Town. Yep. After attending a few funerals, this shop landed in my hands. Course, those relatives were in-laws and Amazy Dayzees at that. Do I look like a flower boy? Course not. I'm not about to let dangerous material walk out just because I'm trying to scrap up enough money to hire someone more 'presentable' for this community."</p>

<p>"Dangerous?" Lemmy almost laughed.</p>

<p>"For most folks it's benign gobbledygook, but for that one percent left, they could end the world with this!"</p>

<p>Unfazed, Lemmy dumped the contents of Ludwig's wallet on the desk, bills and coins scattering everywhere. "Is that enough to change your mind?"</p>

<p>"Stars.." 'Bookmaster' sighed. "You don't get it."</p>

<p>Lemmy bit his lip. "-Uh, Maybe that's why it's safe with us! We're only here because my brother is sick lately, and all I know is that he must really want this book because he never asks for help. He'd use it safely, I promise."</p>

<p>Bookmaster stamped something inside before closing it. The koopaling feared it was over, but then he pulled some paper from a roll and wrapped the book in that, then placed that on parchment tied with a string. "I want to see it back in a week. I know where you live!"</p>

<p>Leaving the store, an orange jumpsuit-wearing crazy guy almost flattened, and if he hadn't cartwheeled for safety a second later, the officers carrying a giant Water Gun Thing would have nailed him next. He saw them hose the escaped criminal into a waiting open paddy wagon. A few gave him some funny looks so he slipped out of that scene by rushing across the bridge Ludwig took. All along he slid his paws over the railings. Often something gold, fish he guessed, slithered around in the olive-colored water below. Shortly a gondola drifted underneath with a spiffy human captaining it and a female noki on the rear holding a lorgnette, whispering a lot between them.</p>

<p>Paranoid, Lemmy avoided eye contract all the way to the rendezvous, a water fountain. His brother sat on the edge, snout buried in his hands, and shawl slung over his back.</p>

<p>Lemmy plastered on a smile. "I got the book at least!"</p>

<p>Ludwig accepted the package with a quiet thanks, holding it up, gracing the edges with his claw and then tucking it under his arm.</p>

<p>"-Sooooo. Are you okay?"</p>

<p>Eyes clenched shut, "NO! We shall never meet!"</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>Ludwig shot to his feet. "Our father's brother! Onkel, who I knew to still be alive and somewhere out there, no matter what our records of sophistry said but now- Now, but those freaks!-" He waved back towards the auditorium. "Expunged his office space I am sure with their nonsense. There is now an infinitesimal chance that I'll meet him before I perish!"</p>

<p>Lemmy slapped him. "Luddy! Breathe! Gosh... We'll find him later."</p>

<p>"There is no later! The brutal and complex truth is that my goals have failed. I yearned for the salvation of our people and while I sincerely believe that the rest of you do as well, I will have no part in your success or failure. That was taken from me this Friday!"</p>

<p>A chill went through the rainbow-haired koopaling. "..Can I ask you something? About last night?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Can you tell me the thing you're not telling me?"</p>

<p>"Can you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You first."</p>

<p>"Are you serious right now? I started it, so you first!" Lemmy half teased.</p>

<p>Ludwig stopped trying to fight, meeting his brother's gaze solemnly. "Notwithstanding rational explanations, merciful gods have tasked me to locate malicious star entities whose leader possessed and executed me last night.."</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>"AAAAAAAHHHHHHH WHAT THE HECK?!"</p>

<p>Lemmy gunned down the block so quickly, the gust sent Ludwig into the fountain. Soaked, he traced his secretary's path into a more populated spot where people shrieked or fled. Lemmy stopped at a crossroads, his thumb in the air.</p>

<p>"I am not being fictitious!-"</p>

<p>Lemmy's powerful 'talk to the hand' gesture created a force field. Ludwig bounced off and clashed into the pottery of the storefront behind him. "That is crazy Luddy. I'll take a cab home.. I can't right now. I just can't!"</p>

<p>Walking traffic thinned and a black sedan marked 'CAB' rolled by. Lemmy swung inside. Ludwig kept close, waving for attention for another block, the pedestrians ahead holding the vehicle at single digit speeds. An animated discussion was occurring inside he could tell. He hoped the cabbie didn't take plastic. Once they'd strayed towards another rural portion of the city that river sliced through, the obstacles were no more.</p>

<p>Lemmy glared at Ludwig from the side mirror. "Hit the pedal to the metal!"</p>

<p>The car backfired, noxious smoke blocking Ludwig. By then gentlemen with sticks and ladies with parasols responding to reports of koopalings in the neighborhood began to hunt him down. He pushed and shoved them off of him, having a nightmare within his nightmare.</p>

<p>"-Monsieur Koopa," yelled a French woman.</p>

<p>Ludwig lugged his attention to the gondola on the river.</p>

<p>"Get-a discount ride today. Got-a special someone? No? (You're lucky)," the human carrying the oars grunted, Italian accent heavier than a Mario brother's. "50 coins."</p>

<p>The noki woman stubbed his toe. "Lets cut ze act. Monsieur Koopa, We are after zhat 'cab' too. Climb aboard!"</p><hr />

<p>She pried her face from her palms to face the visitor. He smiled. It was bright and perfect, so different from the beautifully imperfect one she'd be haunted by forever. "Greetings ma'am. Whom am I to pick up again?"</p>

<p>"Joseph, Timothy, Les, Mr. Zeror, Kinopio-Kun if he's recovered.."</p>

<p>"Hm." He tapped his chin. "Have you forgotten poor little Thomas? Where is he anyway?... How unfortunate." He held his chuckle as he caught her eyes well with tears. See, this was why he did not 'date' anyone, the famously dutiful toad a mopy mess.</p>

<p>Captain Toad stepped around that sad sack to check on the Earl of the kingdom, in his cabin slinging items into a suitcase. He stared from the doorway. Mr. Toad was his weathered older look-alike in the pattern of red spots, height, voice, blood type (as those in Water Land harped on), and build too if not gaunt from his Mushroom Flu aliment. There was never an explanation why, and for one of them at least, that made it so much more special.</p>

<p>
  <em>"Hi."</em>
</p>

<p>"HOLY CRAP I WASN'T SNEAKING OUT!" Toad flung the suitcase high, where it hit the spinning fan and his deodorant and other things spilled out all over the room.</p>

<p>Captain Toad caught a sock from the air. "Need any help?"</p>

<p>Mr. Toad breathed out, relieved in one way, afraid all over again in another. "You'll never hear this again from me homeboy, but yeah. You can cover for me-"</p>

<p>His clothes were whipped up into a tornado as The Captain zoomed beyond him, diving onto his wrinkly, drenched with sweat old bed that he was on while blowing chunks earlier too. Mr. Toad's ears perked, a distinctive horn saving him from witnessing this disturbing scene for too much longer.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>The fringes of the Southern territory were the only place where a native rancher or cowboy might catch a glimpse of a Mushroom Bus. Matted with red dust, the polka dot-covered mass transport vehicle pulled up before two men in red checkered keffiyehs. They waited while its tiny double doors opened and the passengers, all apparently locals returning home, trickled out.</p>

<p>"Howdy strangers." Jr. Troopa rode up on an ostro, winking. With clear intentions to board, the waiver signed and visible in his pocket, the driver was heard preemptively groaning. "Oh, so…Mr. 'TKT' ain't making it?"</p>

<p>The man with a well-trimmed moustache glanced around, unease unfurling in his chest. "That would be his doctor's recommendation, which is precisely why I know that's not what he's done."</p>

<p>He was elbowed lightly by the other man with a short beard. "You know you want him on the trip!"</p>

<p>"Yeah I guess. But at least TKT USED was our first adventure partner. What's with you and Jackson? Are we going back to staging ride-alongs?"</p>

<p>"He's a fine young man now!" In the background the paratroopa became as red as the sun, adjusting his ten-gallon. "And..yeah. Better than nothing if Mr. TKT's sick."</p>

<p>"-We were under the impression he'd miraculously recovered." A slightly chunky toad in a safari uniform left the bus, holding a wrapped present. "I guess not."</p>

<p>"Guess again!" Mr. Toad appeared on the spot to accept it, dressed in his signature vest and all. Immaculate.. Short of that almost open but not fly issue Luigi noticed, but wouldn't mention. No one was supposed to know the Mario brothers were traveling.</p>

<p>"It's a travel pillow. People travel all the time and wish they…. Zzzz."</p>

<p>Toad turned to the others and back to the somnolent Yellow Toad. "Well, thanks again Jörg."</p>

<p>"Blessings unto you, sir. Please accept this supply of the finest electrolytes and supplements from Dr. Mario World." Hint Toad, a similarly dressed blue toad with glasses, handed over a more neatly wrapped gift.</p>

<p>Toad rattled the box. It sounded really healthy, which he kinda didn't like, but he managed a, "Thanks, Heinemann."</p>

<p>A tall slender purple toad presented a get well soon card. "Hi, uh. Blessings unto you I mean. Bill and I were.. Umm, short on time so.."</p>

<p>Mr. Toad accepted the modest card. One message on the inside had the neat penmanship of a postman, the other hardly readable. "No problem. Thanks.."</p>

<p>"Just Mailtoad. I don't, uh, need any other titles. Ha ha." Mailtoad shuffled aside from the last member of the Toad Brigade to depart.</p>

<p>"-Stop standing around- Oh, Hey." The initially firm firm-speaking light green toad was The Captain's nephew, six months older than him in a mundanely interesting way. Banktoad, or 'Bill' was the odd one out in casual clothing short of the headlamp and his arm was in a sling. "We bought overpriced tickets and almost died on our way here from Darker Side, but seeing you up made it worth it."</p>

<p>"Is something going on in other kingdoms?" Luigi asked, pulling down the tagelmust.</p>

<p>Yellow Toad, who was also funnily awake again for that part, had this blunt look, reluctant to go there. "Nothing manmade, sir. Simply a hurricane over Isle Delfino our plane was caught in."</p>

<p>"Tell em, Jörg. Your nose bled just before we entered a dive. Mordecai, weren't you paying attention to the in-flight entertainment?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. We, lost, like, uh 8000 feet," the postman elaborated, making Yellow Toad rouge further.</p>

<p>"Everything's cool homeboys." The card at the end was Mr. Toad's favorite in fact. Banktoad had to have written his heartfelt message with his feet.</p>

<p>The Mushroom Bus successfully dumped one set of passengers to take on another, Jr. Troopa argued with the driver enough to let his ostro on, and eventually the Toad Brigade were free to explore the wonders of the Southern Mushroom Kingdom, shy guys riding ostros, shanty cabins, tumbleweeds and pokies, flowering cacti of a less than sentient sort, and cowboys wrangling, at least for a while.</p>

<p>A kart started starting to creep behind them. It was aposematic the driver understood, the paint was sandblasted off from the desert trek, the leather split, and all the plastics had melted. Still, was a proper ICE kart and his rental duration was the weekend, so he was going to get his money's worth darn it. Either way, he was appalled when his crew ignored him all the way to Mr. Toad's cabin, where they seamlessly slipped inside to fraternize with Toadette.</p>

<p>The Captain bashed a fist against the wheel and then waited, idly playing by pressing strategic locations of arteries to block blood flow, anything to keep him from hurting someone. Someone else rather. When that wasn't quite enough, he reached out of the window and snapped off the kart's searing hot metal antenna to poke himself in the forehead for a while. He watched in a mirror as it sizzled against his skin, leaving a dark mark in the center of it. That was pointless, but they were about to travel places soon enough and I'd look exotic or something.. He proceeded to read over his annotations on a sticky note on 'Special Objects', and how they 'were a possessive force'. He wouldn't have to worry about that-</p>

<p>"No way!"</p>

<p>Finally, the door opened, unleashing a roar of laughter from the group. Toadette semi-supported Banktoad's left side, opposite of the broken arm, together colliding with the others when they saw Captain Toad's kart parked right up against the stairs and him standing on the roof.</p>

<p>"How wonderful for you all to travel down at my request-"</p>

<p>"Stanley-" Banktoad growled.</p>

<p>"-Everyone on this planet knows what Bowser has done, and this is our opportunity to gather the greatest treasure out there, that is after you accompany me on an errand. Get in."</p>

<p>"Treasure?" Toadette mouthed, very loudly apparently, as the toad on the sunroof (precariously with the glass there broken from heat) noticed that gap in the armor and zoned in like a flaming arrow.</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Toadette, hadn't I mentioned? My brigade has shifted from Green Stars and coins to artifacts. Your staff would be acquainted I am sure, at least before your *ah hem* housing crisis. For even more relevance, that Doom Reverb that Mr. Zoo Sue Diddley possessed was from our collection."</p>

<p>Toadette blanched, and suddenly it was the one-armed green toad having to support her. "Is- is this true?!"</p>

<p>"Ma'am, we have become proficient in collecting, categorizing, distributing, and on occasion quarantining artifacts to Fahr Outpost, where the soil deep freezes for eight months every year!" Hint Toad explained. "Needless to say, that one slipped through the cracks."</p>

<p>Banktoad leaned in, "Hey. You know how Stanley and I are practically like siblings. We moved into this thin-walled condo in your hometown Shroom City, and we needed to make more dough simply put.."</p>

<p>Captain Toad had a flash of red seeing them so close, just snapping himself out of it by biting his tongue until it bled. He jumped down and yanked Banktoad off of the porch by the ear, "What's this about, William? Huh? Trying to use your charm, are you?"</p>

<p>He pushed him away with his good arm. "She just broke up with a boyfriend of five years! No!"</p>

<p>He folded his arms. "So you don't fancy her? Then let's go! Her staff can show us everything we need." He projected his voice. "Miss Toadette, my apologies. It was William who dropped the bell during our last Sarasaland expedition and allowed it to fall into the hands of unscrupulous bazaars."</p>

<p>"-Because you 'accidentally' shoved me off a sphinx, Stanley!.. The injury I'm currently recovering from!"</p>

<p>"Wait!" Toadette ran up as most of the brigade, all giving The Captain a withering look, filed inside the kart. "Let me accompany you!"</p>

<p>"Hm, sorry Miss Toadette. No room."</p>

<p>Toadette inwardly screamed as the kart sped off, becoming a traveling dust cloud. There had to be something dangerous out there, in their castle. She ran into the city in a tizzy. She didn't know anyone around her. She doubted she could articulate the situation to nurse Laki, or Victor, or Probabilly, who were all purported to be voluntarily wrapped up in their problems. That left-</p>

<p>"Hey!" A hand grabbed her wrist, spinning her around. "I know we can't be in each other's faces but this is freaking important!"</p>

<p>She gasped. "Blue-"</p>

<p>"-Listen.." That he'd break Mario's orders just to pontificate- and dig his nails into her wrist too, though she was sure he didn't know he was doing that? "..And so let's go. Gold showed me where it was!"</p>

<p>"What!?" Her recoil severed his hold on her. "Wolley's awake!?"</p>

<p>"No, but he still told me. We should find Thomas too. We can't trust the rest of the staff. You said it! So what's left of us needs to handle this. C'mon. I'll even let her do the talking if you think I'll be bad at it."</p>

<p>She turned to whom he was referring to, fainting as the princess revealed her identity.</p>

<p>"Okay, now you really gotta do the talking Daze," he muttered, scooping up the pink toad. "Carrying her around won't be a good look."</p><hr />

<p>"Let's GO! Get out there! DO SOMETHING!"</p>

<p>"...Nice Lord Bowser impression. It's like I was in the torture chamber with him."</p>

<p>"Just find something to do, squirt." the lakitu muttered to the koopatrol, his stealthy nature ruined by his luminous blush.</p>

<p>As there was swampy ground to stand on as of the last hour, Bowser's Minions spread out with their 'Property of Bowser' flags. That was lame and everyone knew it, but with only so many fence posts that hadn't drifted away or swollen to uselessness, the good stuff had to go towards the nucleus of their conquered land, Bowser Tower, and the site soon to be Bowser Tower Junior.</p>

<p>"No no no no no! What is this? Omg.." The furious koopaling dashed to the opposite end of the tower, screaming at the sight of more little red flags. "Why is Daddy doing this?! Somebody haaalp!"</p>

<p>A paragoomba on the rooftop's edge wanted to jump, but he was a physics student once and knew he was too lightweight to die from it. He couldn't sneak away either, as movement would ruin his incidental blending in with the brown inner wall of the parapet. He decided to freeze up and pray.</p>

<p>"You. Oh my gosh, Flippity Flop, you're about to come in clutch!"</p>

<p>-And the stars hated him! She dropped some of her hot pink flyers on the way, one flying into Hippity Hop's face. Without appendages, he had to chew it up and spit it out which, unfortunately, allowed him to know all of what it said by taste alone. That was another curse from the stars.</p>

<p>
  <em>'Vote Princess Wendy O. for Neo Bowser City Council! She will be strong, fair, and beautiful. We will kidnap men for equality and promote the permanent destruction of plumbers! Help her shape the world into a better place!'</em>
</p>

<p>For some actual luck, he guessed, Wendy didn't notice Hippity's grimace while stacking up her flyers again. "Fly me outta here. I'm totes serious. We have to outpace Daddy and his fortresses and junk!"</p>

<p>He grumbled under his breath. "-Yes, my lady.."</p>

<p>….</p>

<p>Meanwhile, another aerial minion checked and tallied up the thousand or so minions, abandoned boats, and property outlines. Once that was done, the fun could start with the couple of spike balls he'd saved up. Within his crosshairs were all of the slackers, like-</p>

<p>"-Ever do a Turkish bath, J.D.?"</p>

<p>Sentry 11 lowered his binoculars, swiveling over.. "Who?" Yuck. Couldn't see himself bathing with those giant Thing stickers, considering he knew their battle effects. "-No I ain't."</p>

<p>Kamek flew along on a broken soggy vacuum he was trying to dry out. "My gal and I wore Lord Bowser down and we were trying to get a bathhouse installed. You know, the kind you take off your clothes and-"</p>

<p>"-Know what Boss? I'll just.. patrol ova there..." Shivering, the lakitu got away, leaving a certain teenager with a blue mohawk safe at the moment.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Larry leaned against the side of a big gravel pile, trying to be invisible. Morton and Roy, the thunder brothers as they were being coined, had it under control in their own chaotic way, slapping together prefab parts to form a hollow structure half the size of a typical Fortress they'd uglify seized land with. The baddies shuffled inside. Hammer bro variants joined together wooden parts, rocky wrenches handled nuts and bolts, monty moles dug for the foundation, goombas and buzzy beetles handled the steady flow of blocks coming in, whomps and thwomps pulverized slabs of stone into said blocks, and most cacophonic of all, Roy and Morton's brains were audibly frying over a blueprint..</p>

<p>"-I know who has mastered mind benders, petulant puzzles, and complex conundrums!" Morton waggled the page before the nerd, thinner than normal, in fact 2D, just standing and holding one expression. "Tell us, quick! Godspeed!"</p>

<p>"..."</p>

<p>"-Magnificent point, Iggy. We should do nothing for Junior, for he is spoiled, pampered, and coddled like a baby! Let us construct him the most monotonous castle ever!"</p>

<p>Roy snatched the papers from him. "I ain't seein' it but, whatever. Let's do it."</p>

<p>With implicit approval from the big bully, the other minions thought it was safe enough to praise Morton for once. Meanwhile, something clicked for Larry. He casually approached the future owner, using a spare bone from a dry bone to draw in the mud outside the construction zone.</p>

<p>"Yo, had a blast at Koopa Scouts?"</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"Uh, cool. That getup is cool AF with uniform, hat, scarf.."</p>

<p>Junior stopped doodling. "I miss camp and my friends and scout master and now I'm gonna be tutored all the time here by grandpa or grandma and I can't go back anymore!"</p>

<p>Larry tilted his view around, getting the full picture of the crude tents and trees. "...You miss it, aww. Hey I can take some of that weight off of you. Literally." He pointed to the giant gold key that snuggly fit in Junior's back pocket.</p>

<p>"Yeah, take this trash!" Junior threw it to the ground, probably confusing that last word for something similar, but close enough. He scooped it up.</p>

<p>"Thanks. Now follow me! You'll thank me for this lesson once you start to use lockers in school. People are too lazy to change the locks, see, so as long as you have a good memory…"</p><hr />

<p>"Nooooo! Noooooooooooooo!" she kept screeching as the paragoomba flew her erratically over green hills.</p>

<p>Deafened, Hippity dropped his passenger where the cluster of flags marked a boundary. He dropped her to her doom, but six feet up at that point, she thought he was doing her a favor. Ultimately he simmered and wrapped his wings to cover his ears as she stormed at the three already there.</p>

<p>"Who is that?!" Wendy dropped her flyers down before the koopatrol, koopa troopa, and apparent dryite.</p>

<p>Tanner gave a salute. "Princess Wendy, Emery T. just arrived, Lord Bowser's latest soldier!"</p>

<p>The dirty toad removed the scarlet covering, revealing her orange spots and messy black medium-length hair, evidently traveling some distance on foot and equally on top of that soaked painting a few yards away. "What he said. I await your command!"</p>

<p>Wendy resisted scrunching her nose at this weird lot. She could salvage this. She always did! Maybe even this was for the best. She never liked the solo thing honestly. "Yas!" she clapped her hands in fake chippiness. "You folks are gonna join the cabinet as deputies for moi! Excited? Good." She pressed the flyers on them.</p>

<p>"Princess. These are.. Brilliant." Johnson flashed an eager disposition towards the 'promotion', at least while she was looking.</p>

<p>"Yeah yeah whatever. Now march! -Or fly for Flippity Flop-"</p>

<p>Hippity growled in the distance.</p>

<p>"-Thanks, you are soooooo kind! I'll meet ya in the city later~" she sang, leaving them with her heaps of propaganda.</p>

<p>
  <em>~Wendy O. Koopa was on fire, unstoppable! Some said the path of the princess was pampered and privileged (and I agree if you're reading this Jade. Please don't kick me out of the club) but she wanted more, a desire no other princess ever had, especially not as a trope in popular children's media.</em>
</p>

<p>"This meta thing is sooo cringe. Can't do it. Ughh.."</p>

<p>She double-tapped on her phone, erasing that from her WIP autobiography on the dinosaur blogging platform Smashing…Live!Journal. She wondered what would work better to win over her incarcerated friends. She might want more on her side filling up the office. That's how change happened!</p>

<p>Brainstorming in the endless fields, she stumbled upon an onyx obelisk on the next hill. She was instantly captivated. It was like tiny void in the universe. Running up, it had a texture to it, small raised characters wrapping around it. She used an app to try to translate a portion, and the camera struggled with the 'dark' object against a 'dark' background. The latest software update was supposed to remove the racism! She had no choice but to get super close, her fingers gracing the surface for just a second.</p>

<p>With a jolt she fell backwards, lips parted as the secrets of millennia unraveled before her eyes.</p><hr />

<p>"Umm, I don't know if-"</p>

<p>"You in or not? I know where snacks are."</p>

<p>"Okay I'm in!"</p>

<p>"Shhh!"</p>

<p>"I'm in.." Junior squeaked, giggling into the clothing bundle in his little paws.</p>

<p>They peeked around the final corner where the fourth-floor prison was, which they were calling a dungeon anyway. Larry wished it was the genuine thing. Those catacombs were always easy to break out of and not even that deep underground. At least there weren't individual cells to deal with, and no shackles and stocks or iron balls and such. Those probably floated off to revitalize imperialism in Water Land.</p>

<p>Good thing Iggy was too busy being a hologram to hear that. The teenager snickered to himself.</p>

<p>"~Yo ho ho, and I hope some kids aren't fooling round up here, and a yo ho ho…"</p>

<p>Then he almost pissed himself. He retracted the key, roped Junior along, and dove behind some stacked crates. Sentry 11 shortly roved about, pausing at the crates. From a slit between some, Larry saw the eye of the smiley face etched on his cloud. He held his breath.</p>

<p>"Hey, we need yer help!" Thuds. Then Thwomp #3 came up to the floor. "Junior's fortress is fallin apart at the seams. We used the wrong glue."</p>

<p>The lakitu pivoted around, cracking his knuckles. "You don't use GLUE for a fortress, rockhead."</p>

<p>The thwomp put on a dopey, if perfidious expression. "Dat splains it.. Check it out will ya?"</p>

<p>Growling, the sentry accompanied him. For Larry it was go time. The gate had a strident squeal, swinging open.</p>

<p>He let it crash against the wall, opening his arms wide and going, "Ruuuuunnn!"</p>

<p>A hoard of teenagers trampled him into something a flat and paper-like as Iggy was looking these days.</p>

<p>"Hi mama Peach!" Junior screeched. "Wear this!"</p>

<p>Peach crept into view, apprehensively accepting the purple 'Kammy' robe. "J-Junior?" She noticed Larry's graceless appearance. "Oh. You're together. Okay." She combed her hair down, composing herself anxiously. "Are we ready?"</p>

<p>Toadsworth, examined the one for him, the 'Kamek' one. "Tally ho!"</p>

<p>Larry's accordion-like arms popped up, one finger pointed. "Shhhh!"</p>

<p>For some reason it was getting dimmer, and if the whole freaking place flooded the freak out, meeting up with Dr. Greg of BATES, the famous hiphop oriented, bass heavy headphone line, would be impossible.</p>

<p>The arduous search began Desert Land. With no jewel encased in a letter to protect them, the four travelers were incinerated by angry suns until the shadow of pyramids provided some respite. After leaving their ostro-drawn cart behind and weaving through the pile-driver micro goomba mazes, none of the dryites, venus fire traps, fire snakes, and hammer bro variants in the tents had seen Bowser. They accepted the stories as truth and moseyed on out of the second Mushroom World. There was some logic to their mode of travel, but the secret plumbers under the turbans couldn't remember what was so compelling about it. The buggy seats were stiff and a barrage of keleptos circled overhead, influencing their beasts of burden to twist around and peck somebody at random. They were turned into pin cushions by the time they encountered white sands and coconut-filled palm trees.</p>

<p>Water Land's mainland was a wild card in the past and present, though the coasts were an alternative more cultured getaway location. They crossed one bridged splotch of land after another, weaving around crabs on the ground and bloopers floating in the air. Clearing that, their koopa navigator fed the big birds, the toad got water, one sleep-deprived plumber continued to rest upon his duffle bag, and the other marked their progress on a map.</p>

<p>"A signal? Impressive."</p>

<p>"Ooh, can ya bid on those Japanese auction sites now?" Toad returned with a full canteen. "Omarinon must allocate a lotta the budget on that- Or not."</p>

<p>Luigi found a 'tower' on the calm blue ocean, a lone pole just bobbing there. Southern Mushroom Kingdom would call that 'redneck engineering'. Daisy 'Cha bu duo'. Toadsworth 'plain unacceptable'. King Omarinon had been brilliantly unorthodox since WW63.. "Maybe. Anyway, Yosh confirmed it's over. It wasn't a spoofed text."</p>

<p>Mario stirred in his seat, and not because his butt was numb. "...No comment."</p>

<p>Toad climbed in, his face long. "Yeah. I guess Yosh picked wrong."</p>

<p>The hunt continued, beyond minka homes and neatly arranged rice fields. Luigi missed most of it scribbling in red on his map.</p>

<p>Toad's hand brushed his shoulder. "We're making good time. Relax."</p>

<p>He dropped the pen. "I'm trying."</p>

<p>"-Hey. Know who didn't pick wrong? Me. I pick you to play tennis with me once this is all over."</p>

<p>They bumped fists, a smile creeping up on the plumber. "That was kinda tasteless, but... why not."</p>

<p>Further inland the fish were replaced with toads in conical hats, living under thatched roof homes. They crossed ornate ancient temples, well-preserved shrines, and small shops, replacing the ocean breezes with the heavy musk of grilled foods. The social atmosphere was a little tense, though ultimately they were allowed to snoop around for baddie activity.</p>

<p>"-I've never liked that 'picked wrong' phrase."</p>

<p>"...That came out of nowhere. Why?"</p>

<p>"I mean it's not 'wrong' Luigi, but it implies, least to everyone I've heard on that stuff, that there's one right person and that they'll be 'right' forever. Well, huh. Maybe they were never right, you know? Maybe they were for the first month, year, or decade until they weren't!"</p>

<p>"Stars that's depressing, but your brother's right, Luigi."</p>

<p>"Then how do you think you can be sure, Toad?"</p>

<p>"I'd delineate like this: it starts with the parents or equivalent. I guess you see that and if it was good, replicate that. If bad do the opposite. Growing up Duke was our 'leader'. Think your brother plus chicanery minus all of his charisma and good qualities. And balls. So yeah. Don't be like Duke."</p>

<p>Mario's lack of response made that funnier to Luigi.</p>

<p>"Without delving into what's already known as Mario Brother deep cuts, 'Papa' and 'Mama' Mario, aka Lorenzo and Concetta were both the 'work quietly in the background' type. Little dichotomy there."</p>

<p>"So.. they picked well!"</p>

<p>"Ha... I suppose. As a young man, what I perceived as a hands-off approach was irritating, but due to that I had my life in order. I had a meager but sufficient apartment to myself, meanwhile my brother couch surfed or lived in the shop. That's why he had two keys."</p>

<p>"Are we auditioning for Koopra Wenphry or somethin? Sheesh." Jr. Troopa quipped.</p>

<p>That lightened the mood while dealing with the border crossing. Suddenly Japan didn't want to pay homage to the past and everyone had to be meticulously scanned twice. They got through that, crossed a final red-arched bridge over a gentle stream, and entered the fourth Mushroom World, Giant Land. The forest canopy made the midday dark, and their torches illuminated the belligerent faces of locals who didn't like Bowser nor them, giving chase through the villages of log cabins. It seemed pertinent to survey for Bowser activity from the upper mountain ranges.</p>

<p>"-Psst, partners... I love his beard," Troopa cooed spontaneously. Mario was slumped back, duffle bag cradled in his lap like a teddy bear. More strikingly though, his identity-concealing headwear was off so that his nice fade haircut was out there, brown hair contrasting the darker facial hair.</p>

<p>Toad giggled mischievously. "Would you air that out on Koopra Wenphry?"</p>

<p>"I didn't mean it like- Well I did but-"</p>

<p>"Hey we all know Mario's a manly man even without any facial hair. Remember when he lost that bet?.. Not a beardfish like King Elderberry."</p>

<p>"-Look It'd be weird to tell him to his face-"</p>

<p>"Why? He's twice your age? ..Or a human?"</p>

<p>"Okay fine! I'm intrigued by humans.. and toads because.. they're different!"</p>

<p>"Different is good. Nintendo had a slogan like that. Or was it about touching?-"</p>

<p>"Stop screwing with me with your zesty self. I have a sixth sense for that."</p>

<p>"What's that?" Toad laughed.</p>

<p>Luigi was covering half his face with the bifold map, about as red as the Earl, except from embarrassment. "Toad!"</p>

<p>"Let him cook, homeboy." He held his torch like a mic. "This is the Mr. TKT talk show now. Spill it Koopa."</p>

<p>Pulling the reins, the buggy sped up around the precarious upswept curves. "What you call me?-"</p>

<p>"Mario calls Bowser that, pussy."</p>

<p>"-I know! It was the cadence I didn't like, Toady. Anyway I'm saying you're GAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYEEE!"</p>

<p>Luigi tossed the map aside. "Are we done with this juvenile nonsense?"</p>

<p>Toad crossed his arms behind his head, leaning back. "Sure. That's just like, homeboy's opinion man. It wouldn't matter what I am. That Special One concept's for regular people like Jackson. Not people like me."</p>

<p>Luigi's cold expression towards the cheeky bastard melted into somberness, not getting a chance to extend the 'talk show' as they found a scouting point.</p>

<p>Snapping back to some semblance of professionalism, everyone sans Mario scanned the clusters of trees, villages, and mountains for black and scarlet Bowser flags. The idea planted itself in the green plumber's head that a fated remote Spear Guy village had to be found and Yoshi could do that. Conjured was vivid imagery of bubbling cauldrons flipped on their sides in the battle, chanting warriors armed with bloodied spears, unable to ward the army off, and long shadows dancing high on the protective rock barriers. He sweated through all of his layers as the Koopa Troop swept them away, the villagers' blood on his hands…</p>

<p>"Nooo nooooo NOOOO!"</p>

<p>He came to, on the hard rocky ground for some reason. The phone he'd fallen onto and cracked had an unsent text box on it to Yoshi, filled with gibberish. Toad never reacted to his freak out, facing the horizon with a blank, mildly haunted face.</p>

<p>Jr. Troopa sprung from the opposite side of the precipice, an oxygen mask strapped to his face. "Dagnabbit I forgot to warn about..." He paused as the ground vibrated just a tad, sending a bunch of pebbles flying in their faces. "...Well heck, not this!-"</p>

<p>The ostros went buck wild, slinging the cart down into the canyon with Mario in it. The three ran or stumbled downhill until they fell off a cliff and tumbled the rest of the way. Mario was dumped out as the birds snapped their reins and escaped. The passage they'd come from was sealed by tons of rock, the first thing Mario saw after he peeled himself off of the dried salt lake.</p>

<p>"I fall asleep for five minutes and.. Kidding kidding.." he laughed it off, unzipping that duffle back finally. The interior glowed from what they saw at least. The quaking intensified and they couldn't stand. "Aww, squashed the Frog Suit, the best one. Well, the rest of the powerups will make up for it."</p><hr />

<p>Lemmy glared at his brother demonstrating why even he got sick of him sometimes. A human and noki were rowing the gondola frantically to keep up from the river and Ludwig flailed his arms, doing nothing to assist. The douche must have hijacked them. While cranking the window up, it snapped off and bounced under his seat, clashing against unknown objects. Lemmy quickly pointed outside, pretending that was the plan.</p>

<p>"Oh my goodness! Just look at Luddy over there! Huh? Huh? Huh? See him? Huh? Huh?"</p>

<p>"-SHUT UP!" The red boo aimed a shotgun out of the window, the long barrel inches from the koopaling's snout.</p>

<p>"Whoa! He's not <em>that</em> annoying!"</p>

<p>"I ain't wasting bullets on him, trust me."</p>

<p>Lemmy concluded those 'victims' must be plain-clothes cops. "But why would your enemies work with my brother? Please don't lie."</p>

<p>"Alright kid... They're enemy spies!"</p>

<p>Lemmy yanked the gun from him, on his own team only now. "Pfft. Fine. Luddy, duck!"</p>

<p>Pow! Pow! Bullets rippled the water. Ludwig fell backward, the other two crouching with him. The steel reinforcements lining the sides saved them, though he was still banged up from his not-so-soft landing spot. There was a picnic basket with grenades hidden under the flap and a metal suitcase with a disabled thumbprint reader, replaced sloppily with a normal lock, along with a silver pistol with a shopping tag tied to it, stating 'not a gun'.</p>

<p>"I should packed the bazooka." The noki tossed away her umbrella, the cab down the road. "But nooo a madame like me only needs to zit and look pretty!"</p>

<p>The human sent her a nasty look before grabbing an oar to end their wayward drift. His top hat was blasted off, revealing golden brown hair and pointed ears. "Yes, bring out the heavy stuff. -So you can aim it afterwards at-a me! Let's-a catch cut him off on-a foot."</p>

<p>The noki resigned to his suggestion, overly casually in Ludwig's option. As they rode up on the river bank, it was a miracle his heart was still contained in his rib cage. The man shed his jacket entirely and his lady her jewelry and heels.</p>

<p>"Got it all?" the human asked ahead.</p>

<p>"Now we do." Ludwig stepped onto the soggy soil, revealing the 'not gun'.</p>

<p>"Aye aye aye, Monsieur Koopa, that is not a gun," the noki informed, just a tiny bit like he was daft.</p>

<p>"Correct. Not not a gun," Ludwig reiterated as they crossed the street.</p>

<p>"He-a needs to throw that-a back! It's-a not not not a gun."</p>

<p>"I concur!" Ludwig swung it around a finger.</p>

<p>"You're still holding it!.. It's not not.. Get rid of it!" They yelled at him.</p>

<p>"I surrender." He smirked as they jumped a fence and entered the outskirts of a busy developmental zone. A posted sign revealed that Peach's new abode was being built, sapping his impish energy. Ludwig would give up everything to go back one day and prevent dark star meddling. No matter how hard he grasped, his chances to rectify matters always slipped between his fingers.</p>

<p>
  <em>'I agree. Bonjour.'</em>
</p>

<p>Ludwig shuddered, scratching the back of his neck where it seemed to be coming from.</p>

<p>
  <em>'You're with Jellien are you not? Excuse me, 'Maria'. Of course we are French nokis as in from Maple Treeway, not as in 'we live in view of the Awful Tower'. Go to so and so to find us and your brother. Trevor has jammed the transponder and they are following a ghost signal...'</em>
</p>

<p>So desensitized at that point, every word channeled to Ludwig's brain had unchallenged verity. He relayed that out of the blue, which the noki and human didn't listen to. He pointed the pistol at them. Now they treated it like a real gun.</p><hr />

<p>Lemmy tried to relax, though deep down he feared he'd gone too far, somewhat literally. The road strayed from that river into the most exemplary parts of enemy territory, and it surprised him. They rode alongside a meadow filled with red Amaryllis flowers, leading to some fairground. It featured a carousel, a Ferris wheel, a wimpish roller coaster, wooden patios, and prize stands with balloons, reasonably packed for the weekend with toads. Neighboring was a gated palace, resembling an elongated Peach castle, except with the accent color of black instead of pink. The stained glass windows and flags on the spires featured the Mushroom Crest. The grass was so perfect he'd think it was fake if there wasn't a toad on a riding mower in the south corner. That was only the first castle, there was a second one next to it, taller, then another, then a huge garden, then big statues of figures..</p>

<p>Lemmy couldn't ignore the hairy feeling in his throat any longer. The fun, sometimes rough, but authentic parts of Mushroomite society Peach created or influenced, the cities and such where he toured with his crew were great. This was too.. he guessed, but not if it was to replace that stuff. He thought he could change the world by showing everyone that a Koopa prince could be good and peaceful. What if that wasn't enough sometimes? What if the only way to change the world he loved was war?</p>

<p>As quickly as the extravagance appeared, they squashed some traffic cones and went off-road, the nice surroundings replaced by high mounds of dirt from a construction zone. A plethora of dumpsters were filled with recently cleared brush and there was an Earth mover next to a deep trench with a tube going down it, the other end leading into the forest. It all worked out in a way Lemmy rationalized, as that got him to heed the meter again, scrolling towards some high numbers.</p>

<p>"Hey. Umm, this way kinda sucks. Could you drop me off now?"</p>

<p>"Wait till we at the lake."</p>

<p>"What lake?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, probably not much of it left. Should still be deep enough. Hehe."</p>

<p>They drove around on some hiking trail to a clearing, where Lemmy found that tube again. The cab pulled up slowly to the mostly depleted basin, creating a long drop down into the remaining pool of water.</p>

<p>"Now pay up and get out," the red boo rasped, strapping some goggles on. "I only took ya 'cause I'm about to ditch this thing."</p>

<p>"Drats! I mean...So I have a card on me but, it's my brother's and I forgot the pin-"</p>

<p>"WHAT?"</p>

<p>Before Lemmy could hop out, hands were at his throat. Honestly he was surprised it took this long to be assaulted. He strangled the boo's scruffy neck back, as hard as he could with his waifish arms until they were both turning blue. Lemmy didn't have a checkbook so he sorta had to win this or else, or... do this instead, spotting movement in the side mirrors.</p>

<p>"Okaytimeout!" he ground out.</p>

<p>They let go, gulping for air. Lemmy used that armistice to whip out his phone and text someone. "Don't worry. I'm just asking for the pin! See? My brother's right there."</p>

<p>"GET OUT!" the red boo roared hoarsely, mashing a device for legless drivers. The wheels spun on the loose soil.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>When the trio burst out of the greenery, the cab was less than twenty feet away from that lake, about to plunge.</p>

<p>"Mon dieu!"</p>

<p>"Excuse me, miss!" Ludwig fired the gun at the wheels. A long hook shot out and looped around the bumper, the knot of rope on the ground pulling taut. "Grab on!"</p>

<p>The noki's hands clutched his waist and the human hers, all three slung forward and dragged until they banged their heads on a chopped tree stump. From that jolt the cab's bottom frame violently tore off into the basin, leaving the hooked chassis to drop and hang half over the edge, bumper warping in the middle. The trunk area of the frame went convex, allowing a small hand to slither out, and feel around for a button near the keyhole, popping it open. A flowery shirt-wearing noki crept out, beaten and with red scars on his wrists and ankles.</p>

<p>"Why is 0064 like-a that?"</p>

<p>"He is an in-denial diabetic," the noki struggled, "zhat's pretended to be 35 for the last few years.."</p>

<p>Ludwig never noticed him crawl closer and bite into one of his nasty Excess Express protein bars without removing the wrapper, as he was wheezing in agony at the sight of Lemmy beating against the back window of that wretched cab.</p>

<p>The male noki launched to his feet and tugged the rope, scraping the sedan from the ledge. As everyone behind him collapsed over each other, Lemmy tumbled out of the hoopty with a busted lip.</p>

<p>"Uhhh.. So glad I didn't prepay.."</p>

<p>He pulled Lemmy up by the plastron. "I am Detective Bond. Where is M?"</p>

<p>"Huh? I dunno!"</p>

<p>Bond obsessively searched, leaning all the way into the basin until he was pulled away.</p>

<p>"Mon frère! M can evanesce at will. Let it go." The nokis embraced, kissed on the cheek, then pulled apart. "Now," she ventured with some venom, "Why did we have to help you out of la prision?"</p>

<p>Bond had a flash of guilt on his round pale face. "I had a hellish vacation, that is how." He shifted around her. "Which of you sabotaged the cake?"</p>

<p>She scoffed, slapping him. "Neither of us."</p>

<p>"Well it would not be the first time you've tried to kill me. I still have that scar from being dangled off of a skyscraper!"</p>

<p>"You forgot my anniversary."</p>

<p>"And why would I celebrate that when you two have been meaning to divorce for a decade?"</p>

<p>"Hey!" Waldo, the human barged in. "..It's-a complicated. Are you running from Jeremy?"</p>

<p>"Him?"</p>

<p>"Oui." They cornered Jelectro. "Some horrible man, some Mitch Toad told us everything, mon frère. You know your partner's particular ways. Far more particular than mine-" She ignored her husband's sharp intake of air. "-And he cannot suspend SS HQ until all agents report in. Does this make sense?"</p>

<p>"Aye aye aye!" Bond cried. "It does. So much it hurts. Help me take care of Bowser's children and I will explain as best as I can.."</p>

<p>The human with his arms folded glanced around. "Who again?"</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>The koopas silently backed to the construction zone, hiding behind a big tractor while toads hardhats worked in the field. Peach's new castle had the same square footage they estimated by the moat starting to be dug, but no weak side on the right where the real thing had a garden and stream that was Bowser's easy way to invade dozens of times. They were evolving!</p>

<p>"Okay, so... I'm sorry for everything, Luddy. I didn't want to believe this stuff was real, but now I'm on your side."</p>

<p>Ludwig slid against the vehicle to the ground, the turnaround nearly inconceivable. "..Thank the stars. Ian, hold no harsh feelings for I would have behaved identically. With no exaggeration, Rosalina's Gravitational Pull is the only force that melds my essence to this body, and there is no guarantee it will remain so before I complete my mission."</p>

<p>Lemmy gaped. "I thought we were talking war stuff!"</p>

<p>"We are, if an antecedent one."</p>

<p>Lemmy watched anxiously as his brother flipped through the lexicon, fighting against crisp pages. He jut it forth on a portion detailing a star, an ancient tempest god.</p>

<p>"That's what happened last night?"</p>

<p>"And it's only the start." The elder koopaling stood, pleadingly. "Forget any harangue of mine over Mushroomites and our people. If we don't stop the dark forces, neither of us will possess any territory!"</p>

<p>Lemmy nodded through his tears. "Where do we go?"</p>

<p>"-He should go right about.. in our custody!" Jelectro secured Ludwig's arm, sneaking up with the other spies.</p>

<p>Waldo secured Lemmy in the air. "Ahhh! I didn't do it! I mean I know I shot at you and my brother is responsible for the Mushroom Flu but not that other stuff! Luddy, show him our uncle's business card."</p>

<p>The blue-haired koopaling lifted his head, rife with perplexity, "Erm that is somewhere in my shell, but he is a respectable business koopa, the reason we are here!"</p>

<p>Bond huffed. "What is this malarkey?"</p>

<p>"You'd never dismiss a TOAD businessman!"</p>

<p>The commander played up his offense, but the others were lapping it up, so clamping the koopa's wrists harder, Jelectro went, "Petite soeur, get that card so that 'uncle' can exonerate them."</p>

<p>"Read the number from his mind."</p>

<p>"Ha ha ha, no.." He flushed. "I cannot! Call Mr. X already!"</p>

<p>"No one ever said their uncle's name!" Maria jabbed her brother's chest. "You have powers and that is why you are a 'Jelectro' just like our parents Hot Foot and Pokey."</p>

<p>"-And you are a 'Jellien' so committed to fakeness that you changed your name and married an expy of Wario. I will admit to being a freak when you do!"</p>

<p>"C'est impossible!" Maria shoved him and he released Ludwig to shove back. There was a rip of a dress, then a whack across his face from her, and then Waldo had to drop Lemmy to chase the nokis rolling around on the red dirt.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the koopalings walked away, casually at first, breaking into a sprint since some toads were spotting them. Before a proper chase began, the ground began to quake, rattling heavy equipment and making the mounds of dirt shake apart. The koopas crossed a street where a car honked them down, and fled through a riparian zone, wadding the river, then entered red flower fields-</p>

<p>"Oh I was here before."</p>

<p>Ludwig observed the fifteen or twenty-foot statue of a human woman. She had ringlets and a pouty expression, hands clasped in front of a brooch on her dress.</p>

<p>"They weren't around the first time tho," Lemmy added.</p>

<p>Toads had already abandoned the fair rides, some silent alarm hidden in fake rocks pulled on them. Behind golden gates, guards were spilling out of two red doors of the smallest palace. In the stained glass there was a silhouette of a man. No doubts about who it was.</p>

<p>"So ein mist.."</p>

<p>Lemmy checked his watch, drawing a new minute hand with a broken crayon. "Up here. Quick!" He vaulted up to the statue's elbow. "Come on!"</p>

<p>Ludwig reached his arms out. "Some assistance?"</p>

<p>"Oh yeah.."</p>

<p>Lemmy hauled him up as dozens of guards trampled flowers to gather at the base and raise their super scopes, holding fire. The koopalings were on the likeness of Queen Toadstool.</p>

<p>"Do you have your zapper?"</p>

<p>The guards hurled themselves to the ground as Lemmy shot into the sky. Now Ludwig was sure they'd find a way to blast them away without hurting the statue. Guards on the palace roof had them in their crosshairs, he caught the glint in the sun. He almost lost his balance as something zoomed overhead, presumably a missile. The glowing ball rounded back, firing a blue beam. Ludwig became weightless, lifted up and away. The toads down there got over it soon enough to start shooting, but the energy balls couldn't penetrate the tractor beam and they were out of range in moments. The entirety of downtown Poshley Heights scrolled below, where that earthquake was stronger and pedestrians ran amok in between buildings with shattered glass.</p>

<p>"Kon'nichiwa, Luddy and Lemmy-sama!" The koopaling-cyborg twisted around and waved. "Thanks for the signal. My sensors are picking up on a friend on the edge of the solar system. Can I check on that?"</p>

<p>"Is he a cop or secret agent or something?" Lemmy asked. "Sorta.. burned out on that."</p>

<p>"Nononono!.. Wait, yeah but, wait..I can totally explain!"</p>

<p>Ludwig silently to rode along as the Earth shrunk below. He could a sworn there was a divide on it, as if a cosmic scythe ran across the land masses in a perfect line. He was distracted shortly by something escaping his shell, a business card he had kept on him in actuality, from when the curiously named 'Clarentine Koopa' ran his Authentic Restortaions Inc. from 1010 Beverly Lane, Poshley Heights. 'Call him at..'</p><hr />

<p>Some Mushroomites sealed themselves at home discussing the twists and turns of life, the costs of food and supplies in shops skyrocketed, and others rolled their yet broken-in karts out of the garage to skip town under the evening sun. One station wagon entered Toad Town so wild and hit so many fire hydrants, that tanks driven by the King's men began to swerve and clear the street for them. Anyone caught on the street didn't know it, but they were about to travel a lot lighter if the beige kart stopped at a red light they were at.</p>

<p>The secret was the pudgy Yellow Toad in the back seat, tattling on people in his sleep, causing gold bars x3, pearls, flashy battle stickers, and other valuables to miraculously appear in Banktoad's hands. Startled, he'd eject the objects out on the sidewalk where the victim nearby would find it- hopefully.</p>

<p>"Hey. We need to hurry up..."</p>

<p>The Captain laughed. "Of course."</p>

<p>Funnily his driving improved, sorta. They sent Mailtoad into MK Hospital East under the guise of delivering a parcel, and he was in and out before Captain Toad got the kart off the curb he'd pulled up on.</p>

<p>"Mr. umm Lionel won't discharge himself yet," the purple toad explained, leaning into the widow.</p>

<p>Banktoad checked the manifest from Toadette, really two candid sentences: 'Take caution with Kinopio-Kun. Monitor Mr. Zeror and his acolytes.' "So he's still recovering, Mordecai?"</p>

<p>"No. Some, uh, business partners want him to forward Crabbie Grass."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"It is a herb typically used to cure Bean Fever," Hint Toad explained. "It may also be used to lessen symptoms of many other ailments."</p>

<p>Banktoad couldn't dwell on that, The Captain asking impatiently where to go next. "Hotel Mario?"</p>

<p>A few close calls later, they found the establishment devoid of castle toads, but at least learned from the receptionist that the Waluigi Spitballs were winning over the DK Kongs by two runs in the eighth inning. Back to the less than auspicious streets...</p>

<p>"Might that be Zess T walking there," Hint Toad said, making them all turn that way. "Without makeup of course."</p>

<p>"No... but they work for Peach! Go there Stanley," Banktoad directed, his uncle making an illegal U-turn on the spot.</p>

<p>The fluffy orange toad in an apron was at Flower Lane, not far from the Mushroom Press. Tanks had torn up the street, their kart sparking on the potholes at high speed.</p>

<p>"Ah! I don't have coins on me!"</p>

<p>Captain Toad lowered the window. "We're out of that business, I assure you."</p>

<p>Gathering his breath, Chef Tim dropped his arms. "If your kart was black, you'd pass for gangsters."</p>

<p>"Do be less prejudiced, sir. All colors of vehicles can be problematic- not that we are."</p>

<p>"Ignore him.." Banktoad capitulated. "We're helping Mario out and you can have the last row to yourself until we find.." He consulted his notes again.</p>

<p>"Scratch Les from that. As for the rest, we had a 'row'. That's why I'm here instead of with them at the castle-"</p>

<p>The Captain zoomed off with the chef hanging halfway out. He was yanked in before a tank going the opposite way flattened him, and he barely carped over it. His soul hadn't returned to his body since earlier tragedies, and following a yawn from Yellow Toad, the chef found his eyelids drooping. He was fast asleep before they hit Toad's Turnpike. They wrapped around the city and took an exit onto the indigo meteorite-like ranges of Star Hill, sprinkled with small shreds of the Peach's Castle. They left the chef behind and trickled out.</p>

<p>"Did anyone pack their boots?... No? That's not the adventurer's spirit!"</p>

<p>"Just be grateful we're still hanging in there, Stanley. Complement someone!"</p>

<p>"You're easy to manipulate-" He was punched in the shoulder. "Joking! Even in this hideously polluted atmosphere, no one's eyes sparkle like yours, William."</p>

<p>He signed, just not too deeply. The windy trail was smoky and smolderingly hot. It seemed unlikely that anyone would be around until they got close enough to peer onto portions of castle grounds. The source of the smog, guards were trying to stifle fires their artillery created while the fire department was deadlocked on Royal Raceway. The lake had police banners around it, a crime scene, and the longest hose they had was a few feet too short to reach a hydrant. They said some maniac driving earlier mowed down half of them in town...</p>

<p>"I hear something." The Captain sliced through some bushes, causing a big scuttlebug to jump out. One of them screamed.</p>

<p>"... Sorry sir," Hint muttered.</p>

<p>"Shh!" The Captain tore more branches down barehanded, creating a window into a desolate, seldom seen rear court of the castle, where some crumbly white stone portions of the foundation held on. A green toad was huddled beside some neatly arranged chests and items. His suit and styling were antiquated, but he was sprightly, carrying one of the four heavy chests by himself, at least until someone volunteered to help.</p>

<p>"Allow me, sir-"</p>

<p>"Stars, who are-! Stop!" Mr. Zeror struggled with Captain Toad, tugging on both ends. "You'll damage something!"</p>

<p>"Oh no, I'm an expert with.. fragile.. goods.." The Captain sniffled a bit, overwhelmed by his glimpse at the heirloom inside, a pink jaggedly cut jewel.</p>

<p>Suddenly a blur bulldozed the Captain, sliding him away, a foot deep into the soil until he hit the remains of the Eternal Star fountain. Upon that relic that had confounded visitors for decades, The Captain was pinned by the pink gardener in the tattered vest.</p>

<p>Joseph temporarily climbed off the scoundrel with the goonies circling him, signing, "What are you doing?" Then to Zeror, "You know who they are right?"</p>

<p>Zeror dusted himself off. "They're pirates either way! Keep holding that one down."</p>

<p>Banktoad flinched, galvanized to rush between them. "Look we're just here to take you home. Or- you know what I mean!..."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Yellow Toad had a splitting headache, unable to sleepwalk any longer. The source was from where Banktoad stood...</p>

<p>"Hold it!" Zeror gasped at the emptied chest at his feet. He whipped towards the Brigade. "All of you freeze. All of you!"</p>

<p>"What?" Banktoad watched the other green toad steamroll Mailtoad first, who calmly offered his satchel, mostly confused. Hint Toad shook in his not-boots and inverted his pockets voluntarily and Yellow Toad didn't resist being manhandled, getting a nosebleed for no reason. Zeror arrived at Banktoad, clamping onto his bad arm in the sling and ripping the jewel away.</p>

<p>"I knew it! I am a laical toad, so explain your tricks."</p>

<p>"It's redirection," Bank sputtered. "I didn't mean it, so don't be a jackoff- Oww!"</p>

<p>Hearing his nephew threatened, Captain Toad flung Joseph off and ran over, snatching the precious gem from Mr. Zeror. He launched it with speeds rivaling DK's star pitch against the battlement. The Jewel of the Stars shattered on impact, into pieces too numerous to count. That violent haze lifting from the red toad, just a tad, that was okay.</p>

<p>The Jewel of the Stars had been cut to create the dazzling jewelry seen on many monarchs past. -Besides Peach perhaps. So, taking advantage of everyone's stunned silence, nothing bad should have happened when he waltzed over to pick up the biggest remaining chunk.</p>

<p>-Except, following a deafening crack, the world began to divide itself from where they stood.</p>

<p>Wendy's friends caused minions to either squawk or abandon their projects to give chase. Fencing, supports and cannon mounts fell apart, creating a trail of destruction wherever the fugitives fled. Larry meanwhile climbed the tower to survey from the telescope on the roof. He to relax about it, to stop clenching the railing like his life depended on it, but the moment he did, he was knocked flat on his shell by a crushing weight-</p>

<p>"-Sorry shorty!" The mega goomba that trampled him turned around. "Wiggs, since you have extra arms.."</p>

<p>Wiggletron peeled Larry off the ground, teasing, "Might I lend you my glasses, Richard?"</p>

<p>The goomba scoffed. "-Might be on ta something, Wiggs. I didn't see who the call was coming from. Least we can bill em more!"</p>

<p>"Absolutely!" When they chest bumped, Larry was released, falling and bouncing around like a ping pong ball on the way to the bottom and out of the tower, smashing finally against the Mushroom Kingdom Disease Control Unit truck parked there.</p>

<p>The teenager opened his eyes. "Ahh!... Wait.. WAIT!" He climbed up. "I'll pay ya to pick someone up! Two people in a..."</p>

<p>After their two agents hopped in the back, the truck left the fifteen-year-old in the dust. He coughed, fanning it all away to reveal Bowser in the tower doorway, clawing through his hair and whipping left and right at the madness.</p>

<p>"WHAT'S GOING ON?!"</p>

<p>Larry solidified on the spot. "(Oh sheeeeet)- So there was a mix up with the keys and-"</p>

<p>"-I knew trouble was coming when Gramps and Old Hag went on a shopping trip! I appreciate cha for sticking around so loyal tho!" He ruffled his son's limp blue hair. "Now I'll be RIGHT OUT!"</p>

<p>Bowser wasn't really, in an alcove on the first floor, tapping his foot following the beep of a voice mailbox. "Hey. Mario, don't come here yet. No I didn't just lose Peach. I'm just setting stuff up according to my demented dreams and need a few minutes. Bye!"</p>

<p>"Dad."</p>

<p>He jumped, hiding the phone behind his back. "..Yeah! He is awesome. Me. Uh, what."</p>

<p>Larry's feet brought him closer, but his body reacted as if he was trudging towards a noose. "I'm not really with this, okay? Not cause it's pointless with Junior being your heir, I want to travel around and DJ and party and drag race and stuff and I can't as some military general!"</p>

<p>Bowser's jaw hung. Then, "Up here."</p>

<p>Larry met his dad in the throne room where graph papers and sketches of anti-plumber death machines littered the floor. Bowser carefully retrieved the heavily battered lapis lazuli bust of a dragon koopa. The teenager couldn't place where he'd seen it before in their old castle. It resembled his dad except with shorter horns, a smaller tuft of hair, and beadier eyes.</p>

<p>"Who's that?"</p>

<p>"-Senior."</p>

<p>"..What?"</p>

<p>"Junior's not 'Bowser Jr.' like we nickname him. He's named after my brother." He sat it on his desk, backing away. "Clarentine dreamed being king and he was gonna, till everybody still alive at the tail end of WW63 saw the <em>how</em> he wanted to rule. They ran him off." He swept over Larry's form. "You remember the restructuring after we lost your mom, right? I ain't super poetic you know, but.. Junior has that name cause for him and everyone else, you were gonna get to pick what you want to do and I wasn't gonna let anything stop ya. Get it?"</p>

<p>The teen nodded again as he was walked out of the room by his dad, arm across the back of his shell.</p>

<p>"Hey I get a tons going on, but for now check on em next door. I asked Wendy and she hasn't answered back. You aced construction core, didn't ya?" Bowser peered out of a narrow window. "The shape ain't even right."</p>

<p>The skeleton of Junior's fortress was rife with activity, rocking in rhythm with the hammering inside. Though not over that talk, Larry did agree, knocking on the door that hung from one hinge a few times. With a whoosh of air that blew him back, the fortress collapsed like a stack of Hanafuda cards.</p><hr />

<p><em>'Unsubstantiated rumors have not phased me regarding Earl. Toad Town is a warped and twisted like them. I will be down Sunday.'</em> -Your King.</p>

<p>Reginald folded away his copy of the fax being passed around, resting against the barracks. "How did that circulate anyway?"</p>

<p>"From within." A skinnier black-spotted trooper slung the super scope over his shoulder, hopping on top of the sandbags with him to watch the Thing Sticker usage. "Better not 'ave been you, mate.."</p>

<p>Under the commotion to follow, Reginald made sure his radio was muted this time. From behind the 'scene', as if the city landscape and everyone in it were props on a stage, a giant humanoid rose, giving a running start before slinging a huge aquamarine ball. It landed with a solid thunk, rolling across an intersection before smashing Dr. Toadley's clinic. Its remains rained from down in colorful confetti bits.</p>

<p>"Have you gone too far? Yes you have!" the owner croaked, unearthed and dragged along by his purple robe.</p>

<p>There was a secondary rumble from some other origin, enough to shake down the barracks. Kart alarms rang all over, a few buildings lost their windows, and parts of the street lifted and curled. They hustled to arrest Dr. Toadley and leave before their stickers got blamed for the seismic event.</p>

<p>One hidden onlooker had no sympathy. They floated down a block and battered a parking meter to pieces with their tennis racket. This sort of thing was happening and Luigi expected them to do nothing? They jabbed the phone for his number again. After not getting an answer they tried Mario's.</p>

<p>"-Kon'nichiwa, Sararīman-sama. Perfect timing. I will work with you if you give me commission for each post with the hashtags-"</p>

<p>Their phone cracked just a little more from their tight hold. "How.. How did you get Mario's..?"</p>

<p>"Is this Boo? …Bought it on black market. Just need a screen replacement and good to go, fufufu. Collector's item considering eh.. he'll never be welcome here again-"</p>

<p>"-What's going on Kinopio? Are you still in the hospital? Don't lie. I. Will. Find. Out."</p>

<p>"...I do not hate Peach. I just want to take my portfolio and-"</p>

<p>"Answer the question!"</p>

<p>Kinopio snorted. "I should blog about you more. Get the attention of 128 billion followers."</p>

<p>"You are about to garner their attention for a different reason, Lionel."</p>

<p>The boo jagged their arm through the screen, emerging on the other side to punch a lime green toad in his chest and slide his rocker against the wall of his deluxe MK East patient room. Frost blasted all over his body and he was paralyzed, tears streaming down as the Underchomp's fangs lashed at the back of his head, saliva splattering on him as it advanced closer with each lunge. He saw in a mirrored version of his room himself as his his soft and young features were disfigured by the throngs of time, leaving a geriatric, stringy gray haired toad, too hoarse to scream as uncontrollably as Kinopio was.</p>

<p>"-Fuzakeru na! Hehe.."</p>

<p>Booigi severed the interdimensional hold before their battery died. Just when they were having fun.. A tank passed by, chasing a mixed lot of Mushroomites holding 'Boo did nothing wrong' signs. Boo threatened to surface and discourage swooping in and amassing 'supporters', but Booigi II was giddy in anticipation. They had a purpose, unlike Boo's wicked cousin, who was punishment without order.</p>

<p>For them it was order. Then punishment.</p><hr />

<p>After a lot of running around in the hot sun, across pastures, in and out of barns, even getting some ranchers with nothing to do to spread the word, the trio regrouped. Toadette realized the other two were unsuccessful and dramatically clung to the lip of the city well, whimpering.</p>

<p>"I'm almost scared for Tom too." Bucken-Berry retrieved a bowie knife from a scabbard. He'd been collecting weapons along the way, first a horseshoe, then a pop-gun, and finally that. "-But we only know him because he ran away a first time. Maybe that's his thing. Not your fault either way."</p>

<p>Toadette stood up, wiping her nose with those ubiquitous red western handkerchiefs. "Yeah, ignore my self-flagellating. Are we ready?"</p>

<p>Daisy threw on her hood. "I'm game."</p>

<p>She trailed the 'kids', sorta like when she was supervising her little cousins from Easton. After the gaiety of having someone to play original Xbox with wore off, those brats mostly reminded her that she was getting 'old' in her thirties. She knew these toads wouldn't sneak into a missile bunker and threaten to glass half of Sarasaland because 'it's just a prank bro', but she suspected Bucken-Berry might misconstrue 'burying the hatchet' if things got too heated.</p>

<p>"Daze, you alright?" he asked.</p>

<p>She stopped spacing out as the tin office door of Jr. Troopa's office slowly swung open. Dr. Toad dropped and snapped a colored pencil.</p>

<p>"Oh, you. And you. And you. Is there a problem?"</p>

<p>"There is," Bucken-Berry said, knife behind his back. "We've noticed you're being paid to sit around!"</p>

<p>"..Why don't we reschedule this consultation." As Dr. Toad backed in retreat, the blue toad snatched his trendy shine sprite embordered shirt, popping a button as the doctor fell backwards, stumbling over a stool and flipping a lab table with beakers.</p>

<p>"Your brother was Toad Town's first serial killer in fifteen years. He left this." He flung the sharp cornered heavy 'Assimilation' portrait at the doctor, jabbing him in the chest. "Feels good to get stuff you care about back, huh? I wouldn't know! You can't run, we know where your spaceship is!"</p>

<p>Dr. Toad propped himself up, unreadable. "..I wasn't privy to some of that. Yes, Zoo Diddley IS my psychotic little brother and I am sorry, but I've been divorced from his life for so long, I thought it was safe to use my real name again. I swear, sir."</p>

<p>What?</p>

<p>"-Sorry for all this doc." Daisy secured the blue toad's arm and Toadette the other. "I'm thinking we were chasing a phantom."</p>

<p>Toadette cringed inwardly. As Mr. Toad would say, 'phrasing'. Bucken-Berry had given up by then anyway, blanched as if he had the half boo blood. The simplicity of the crucible, the prosaic response, devoid of pleas and excuses dashed apart the mass of antipathy in his heart.</p>

<p>Dr. Toad slung the painting aside inconsequentially, grabbing his white coat from a rack. "All is well if you pinpoint the location of Morris' space ship. He is connected to a VIP member of my hospital who can alleviate Mushroom Flu symptoms better than Houdini and his guessing games." He paused, cracking an intriguing smile at Bucken-Berry. "Excuse me, but he could lead the way?"</p><hr />

<p>After the blast from a deep brassy horn, the green shelled koopa troopa gathered his suitcase, weeding through the crowd of Surfshine Harbor. The Princess Peach was ready for the next leg of her journey.</p>

<p>"Theodore!"</p>

<p>The koopa caught Nass T's wound back fist and closed the distance by a step, kissing the back of her palm. The toad ladies had mismatched clothes, the shy guy wore a baggy green hoodie, and the whomp a tan trench coat and newsboy cap.</p>

<p>"Why greet me so feisty-like, Nass? I planned this rendezvous all along!"</p>

<p>"R-really?"</p>

<p>He let her go, twisting around towards a yacht, dwarfed by the ocean liners and cargo ships. Once bright and pink and white, now dingy and maroon with the portholes crying tears of rust since it was deemed an 'overly ostentatious image' for the monarch and sold off to a Lavalava based ferry service.</p>

<p>"Close enough. We better not miss this. Though we're all licensed practitioners of course, where we're going paperwork is more of a suggestion than anything."</p>

<p>Jungle fuzzy sailors began to shout, "All aboard!"</p>

<p>Dr. Prof. leaned in, his breath tingling her ear. "It's a clean slate my dear. Don't appear so flustered." He pulled away, eyes narrowing. "Sounds alright? Alright."</p>

<p>"Theo," she plead. "We can't slip away. You.. know more about this epidemic. At least share everything you know with the-"</p>

<p>His smile sank quicker than a thwomp in the Great Sea. "We could have the cure to Carroboscis on us and we'd get sent to the gallows. Any history of ours with my dear Sweat Pea is void at this point. Don't be stupid."</p>

<p>"No, I was suggesting, perhaps anonymously-"</p>

<p>"-Your funeral, my dear. The rest of you, make a decision. Quickly."</p>

<p>Nass flatlined, watching the man who had slathered decades of her once exemplary life with corruption stroll away. Azul checked with Dr. Terrace. He rose a thick eyebrow to Mariam. The older toad woman sprung away, the first to take an unequivocal stance.</p>

<p>"Mariam!" Nass ran after her. She held up for a quick if snug embrace.</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry dearie," Mariam sobbed over her shoulder. "You wouldn't understand. A remote location is the best for me. Farewell."</p>

<p>Azul pressed forward. "Welp I'm going too. Haha. I'm on the do-not-hire registry. It's like the do-not-call one, except you don't wanna mix them up. Plus," he added seriously. "My mom could use a break from me anyway.."</p>

<p>Dr. Terrace tossed his toothpick. "The tropics might fix these petrified joints, Nass. I'll keep us straight-ish." He gave the orange toad nurse a one armed hug. "If we spot that firebrand daughter of yours we'll hit you up too."</p>

<p>She laughed as he waddled off, the crowd thinned, and the ships left with the tide. Better than crying.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>"When Bowser's running amok, we have to limit capacity. Sorry." Larry the conductor pulled down the brim of his hat, the toad leaving the smug yoshi ticket officer, Peter to stamp 'rejected' on Nass's spoofed form.</p>

<p>Listlessly she got out of line, passing both the katana on a stand Peter was way too proud to display in the train station, and a plain clothed human on the way out. Since Inspector Douglas knew where her confederates would be confined for the next few hours, he moved in to secure the nurse. -To think Sgt. Howie called him a wimp for leaving town! The officer jot down the number of the taxi she took and rode along in his kart, with all the lights off. It was worrying that she seemed to want to return to Toad Town, but he'd figure that out when they got there..</p><hr />

<p>Jim the boomerang bro held the lead due to his extremely cool ninja run, though some points were lost when his trilby flew off. Most followed him, including some magikoopas in purple and blue for a while, holding the hems of the robes. When it became a little too hairy though, they split from the bunch, sprinting alongside some freshly installed barbed wire fencing. The purple one tripped and had to cling to it.</p>

<p>"Princess!" The blue one doubled back. "What is it?"</p>

<p>"It must be...activating.." She reached under her robe, yanking at something near her chest. She ripped off her sapphire brooch and threw it into the grass.</p>

<p>Toadsworth's thoughts veered down the dark part she was going with that, however misdirected. That brooch was just that, practically lavish costume jewelry. Could it mean then..</p>

<p>"Sorry dear," she recovered.</p>

<p>He secured her hands. "Let's move on. *ah hem* I'm rather unwell too."</p>

<p>He pulled her away before a MKDCU truck zoomed past them, smashing through Koopa Troop partitions and creating an expedient route for rebels to aim for.</p>

<p>"Thank you!"</p>

<p>He yanked her after him again, now with a startlingly algid grip and belated response. "Princess Toadstool, you are welcome.. Now fancy this.."</p>

<p>Three mega monty moles held that section of the fencing upward, with five more diligently installing support beams. The small ones pressed their ears to the ground and scurried away. The giant ones followed and the section fell. Peach narrowly avoided the heavy iron barrier with a frantic drive. A wicked cackle followed.</p>

<p>She hauled herself up, "Toadsworth?"</p>

<p><em>"I try to give you a nicer death and you do that. You really are a useless sow as they say. Skeptiztar can have their way with you then-"</em> Toadsworth's magikoopa garb slumped off his figure as he slung her around, her legs scraping against sharp barbs.</p>

<p>"Stop this! What in heavens has gotten into you?!"</p>

<p><em>"Not in heavens. On Earth!"</em> he growled with blackened eyes. <em>"Yo.u'.re a. .bi.g .e. .gi.r ..l n.o.w. Hahahaha. stop.. runnin.g. f...r.o.m. us."</em></p>

<p>The princess's tongue was withered and dry, lodged against the roof of her mouth, strangling her cries for help as she drifted away in spirt, far away until a company barged into them, severing the fatal grapple. While most didn't stop, Roy stooped to his knees, panting from their evacuation of the fortress. Morton arrived last, carrying people under his arms. He propped both down.</p>

<p>"I saved Iggster! Oh and Junior I suppose…. But Iggster looks great. Refreshed. Better! Best!" Iggy's hologram was having the best day ever, contrasting Bowser Junior, squeezing his backpack tightly.</p>

<p>Roy yanked the limp princess upwards. In a blink the old toad vanished. "The heck is happening? And-" The pink koopaling slid his sunglasses down, his seldom seen purple eyes dilating as dots steadily grew in the sky. "Take em and run, Mort!"</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>The 'calling' was a steady pulsing frequency, only discernable to those in tune with the stars. Hearing this, a floating arrow platform brought darker skinned toad in an orange and gold trimmed mantle, King Ed of Sky Land, from his cirrus cloud castle to the lowest. He held out his scepter to suspend the chief officer, taking one last look at his ravaged Tower of Lyribiris.</p>

<p>The soldiers were like his family, the dearth of blood relatives why his weakness was seeking Elysium. They had Bowser's minions outnumbered, but only possessed helmets, parachutes, and spears vs their weaponry. Water Land's toad and aquatic population blotted out King Morton and his monstrous koopa clan with less half a century ago, but K. Ed was not half, or even a quarter as great as their leader. King Omarinon would not have let this situation fester the way he did. With a final bout of reassurance from the stars, he gave the signal. Under the lilt of trumpets, warriors leapt over the edge, unfurling their parachutes.</p><hr />

<p>With so much weighing on his square shoulders, he went with the tried and true stall tactic, "I'll handle questions tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Yes sir."</p>

<p>The grindel left Mayor Koton in his office. With the long curtains closed, his center iridescent 'designer' spike possessed a faint glow he'd rather not be questioned over. The volcanos just happened to be especially active following a big quake that clattered everything in his reinforced fortress. Shaken rather literally, he had to catch up with proceedings before his council turned over Monday.</p>

<p>"-Mr. Mayor sir." A whomp with a blue ribbon, a corporal stood in the doorway. "Candidates here, sir."</p>

<p>Mayor Koton lifted up. "Get the monitor ready!" With his weak little arcs, heading down would take an eternity, that and worsening health a painful reminder of why he needed more Toads like Thomas around.</p>

<p>The whomp had to wheel in a bulky TV on a cart, the flat screen monitor normally there snapping off it's mount and shattering ealier. Downstairs in the foyer, a koopatrol, toad, para-goomba, and koopa troopa stood before office and registration personnel. Koton knew that much of Dark Land, his territory not exempt, was under water and Bowser jumped ship. He couldn't figure out why he was sending this sorry bunch to occupy his prestigious space, passing around kitschy pink flyers before huddling up. The toad, Emery, eventually took the leap before the firing squad.</p>

<p>"Hi. I'm the King's best soldier and I'm honored to present!-"</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>While she distilled Wendy's rhetoric in a slightly less la-di-da way, enough to make Hippy-Hop stop eye rolling and Johnson to pay attention, Tanner took peeks at the letter he'd picked up. All mail in Dark Land funneled to one place in the city, to discourage laziness or something, and he was hankering to know what his buddy wrote.</p>

<p>
  <em>"Riddlle me this, Tanner J Koopa. Y did I rite u?"</em>
</p>

<p>Well why did he? Somewhat analphabetic from missing out on traditional schooling, Zoo talked the talk. He didn't do letters.</p>

<p>
  <em>"...I can't think since knowing what my dad told my brother. Even dreamed I die tonite. Wish I didn't push him away. It's always the wierdos that got me like you. No offence. No jokes or dubble untrundras. Check this out."</em>
</p>

<p>Folded in it was a Lexus emblem. Those carts weren't often seen here, so he'd gotten it from his Toad Town escapades.</p>

<p>
  <em>"Btw '19 18 2 1 09 13 85' is my absentee vote for Monday just in case. See u round."</em>
</p>

<p>Oh jeez, what was this about now? Tanner sighed with his gaze at the chandeliers, the few that had survived.</p><hr />

<p>Having been led away from Bowser Tower and into fields of leafy nothingness, the already negativistic elite soldier of Bowser wanted to remove his balaclava to rip out his hair. "THERE'S NO FREAKING STRUTS HERE ROCKHEAD!"</p>

<p>"The Amazone Prima Guide delivery shoulda came. I dun get it," Thwomp #3 mumbled, behind a few paces.</p>

<p>He had an unmistakable but fleeting spark behind his red eyes and perpetually disgruntled face before diverting, and the sentry learned why. There was a pure black forty-four feet tall and four feet wide obelisk planted on top of that hill. Its unannounced appearance, escaping him the first time, was phobogenic he admitted, but it wouldn't distract him from the concrete rat. Thwomp #3 had a KT tattoo branded on a spike, but he'd inadvertently mentioned once that Bowser's old address was '444 Dark Drive'. That was common knowledge to Mushroom Freaks. No actual resident of Dark Land remembered aside from Bowser himself.</p>

<p>"Be still." Sentry 11 shook the thwomp violently, making a half dozen L shaped folding struts tumble out of his pockets. "What is that?!"</p>

<p>"I dunno!"</p>

<p>"Recite the Mushroomcratic Oath!"</p>

<p>"As a child of the stars, I shall cite none of you in vain-"</p>

<p>The sentry brought out a switchblade, grinning deviously and showing all of his numerous crowns in the back. "-You recited THEIR version, not ours."</p>

<p>He slid closer. "J.D., I must ascertain how you are familiar with Mushroomy curricular."</p>

<p>"..I studied in middle school I think. Then I moved cause Bowser's my idol!" he snarled.</p>

<p>"Your memory may be faulty. I was there, alas one's countenance is the cornerstone of one's identity and mine has been rather knotted up lately."</p>

<p>Sentry dug the blade into his sedimentary layers. "Where ya going wit this, Rockhead-"</p>

<p>The thwomp flicked it out of his hands. "-Lieutenant Stone. Am I recognizable now? You were in my ROTC class, in high school to correct you. Now giving credit due, I have conducted espionage here as Agent 999. -To no credit to you buffoons, I've shared my intel long ago!"</p>

<p>The lakitu stared flabbergast at his old teacher. Lt. Stone was on the cusp of 'young for a teacher' and 'about as expected' back then, an old soul nonetheless with encyclopedic knowledge of all sixty three Mushroom World Wars. Now the most brilliant slab of concrete he'd ever known was scanning him with calculating red eyes.</p>

<p>"With no invidiousness, I hope you are satisfied where you are now!"</p>

<p>"I-I am! This was my place all along. Get it? Just like yours was.. Well not in that gutter called school."</p>

<p>The thwomp snorted. "Touché."</p>

<p>"Don't get comfortable, Teach- uh, Rockhead." He cracked his knuckles. "You're still bout to die for treachery!"</p>

<p>"Hm. I am reminded of glass houses."</p>

<p>"And I'm reminded that I'll need a ditch in the ground big enough to BURY YOU!-"</p>

<p>"~Halt your warring. I need this one. Yes. That one too!" It was an ethereal tone. "My dominion shall be marked. Disband.~"</p>

<p>They broke their standoff as Wendy O. appeared from behind the obelisk. The koopaling princess glided down, holding her thumb and index fingers together at the tips.</p>

<p>"Nona this happened," Sentry 11 grunted.</p>

<p>"Truce. Chump." After one last smirk, the thwomp transfigured into a complete idiot.</p>

<p>Her eyes flared open. "I SAID MOVE THEE!"</p>

<p>Spawning from the obelisk, a black impenetrable beam shot from the face in a flash, hacking through the rest of Sky Land, slicing Bowser Tower in half, preceding into Giant Land, Water Land, Desert Land, the Mushroom Kingdom, Star Hill, and across the Great Sea. It wrapped around through Dark Land, Ice Land, Pipe Land, and returned to it's spawn on the opposite face of the obelisk, creating another planet rattling clap. The Pillar of Understanding phased away, gaping trenches to the lowest depths imaginable.</p>

<p>That was the best way Larry could comprehend it at least, a mile back, hair turned white and gasping for a breath with the super heated air. Either way he didn't think he was going to get his sister pick up any slack.</p><hr />

<p>The luxurious club seating felt like the riding a cloud. There was no entertainment system or coolers of champagne however, but T. Yoshisaur was 10,000 miles above the Great Sea for free, a favor for a 'great hero' stated Anti-Guy, the pilot and friend of the coast guard he met. Yoshi thought he might attempt to spy on Bowser aerially until he was actually up that high, where the world was so tiny and he felt trapped in the pressurized tube, a queasy, teeth chattering flyer instead of the calculating machine his friends needed him to be. He abhorred the periodical buffeting from turbulence, or the wings flexing, though cerebrally it had to be 'normal'. He couldn't even fight to keep Poochy out of the cargo section. Given how he was behaving, that last one might have been for the best. He'd be making his son nervous right then..</p>

<p>Yoshi breathed out and allowed the seats to mold to his stiff body. How would it go after they beat Bowser? What did he like to do aside from Mario? -<em>Away</em> from Mario, he meant? He pinched the edge of the plastic baggy on the fold out table, pieces of that Bronze Egg and it's dark powdery center filling jangling. He packed while in grief. Never good. There was a passport, shaver, a menu from a restaurant way back on Yoshi's Island, and a Phanto Mask if he had to go incognito. He should let an engine shred everything but the passport.</p>

<p>"-Hey sir. We're about to make a small stop in five minutes."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>A toad came from the blue curtain obscuring the cockpit area. He sat behind the fold out lounge table, a snug fit with his heavy tactical vest. "Don't worry. Nothing mechanical. A single pilot or less are required to fly these days and Rodney's got it. You could too after a lesson or two."</p>

<p>"Maybe sometime.." Never in fact! "-Again I appreciate this."</p>

<p>"It's not a problem. It's the one bright spot on this job.." Sonny played with a canteen in his hands. It was disturbing to have a bloated decaying body on board, the toad tense since, and Yoshi sympathized, but ultimately Sonny was perhaps better letting that other guy or automation navigate them.</p>

<p>They landed on a strip of land so tiny the dinosaur had clicked on a seatbelt and braced for a ditching until the last moment. Few tropical tree branches whipped the fuselage as they rolled down a cramped rural runway, then turned towards a wooden hangar, almost over taken by M. Bush. Sonny left the plane and disappeared behind the mimicry grass, followed by that mysterious if polite black shy guy. They were gone for so short of a time it was almost suspicious and the plane taxied around to take off on the same little runway. By the trumpet and bellbell plants, it must have been a private Lavalava island.</p>

<p>"-Are you okay?" Yoshi asked in the middle of the toad taking another swig. While he became more comfortable after the second take off, the toad was sipping more.</p>

<p>He sat the canteen down hard. "No not really. I could have saved that guy in the tackle box if I wasn't sucked in by office politics."</p>

<p>"Don't let the hypotheticals consume you. I say that from experience."</p>

<p>"I know. At least I'm finally doing something important."</p>

<p>"What was your previous job?"</p>

<p>"I was the lead in the Toadtanic series, Emerson Lake Toad," he beamed.</p>

<p>No wonder Sonny looked sorta decent while unkempt.. "The one that has the same ending every time? ..Sorry."</p>

<p>"Naw, you're right on it. Left after the threequel, when I had this fan disappointing epiphany. I just wanted to do something more substantial. I donned a wig to sneak away from the talent agencies and leave Neon Heights. Besides acting I have an odd skill set. Besides being ribbed over literally everything, like my crush on Wendy O., it works out here."</p>

<p>Yoshi flushed. "..Interesting."</p>

<p>"I'm just 19. Don't worry."</p>

<p>"It wasn't over that." He diverted to the window view. "My Special One is more difficult to explain. I cannot judge."</p>

<p>"Listen, it was easier to tell the crew I was bipolar than for them to accept that such a 'prissy' red toad could fancy a koopaling. Everyone judges anyway."</p>

<p>"No no. I understand. I'm bipolar too."</p>

<p>"-The sequel?.. Foolin.." He smiled back. "I've wanted to say that forever. Don't call me a dork."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't!" he laughed. "You might meet Wendy one day if you stick around us. If it would work out I can't speculate. You know how girls are with their types."</p>

<p>"Sweet, mister. Thanks!" Sonny appeared to ponder. "So.. on the note of your friends and such sir. That body we found. He's-" A ding went off, somewhere near the cockpit. The toad got up. "...I better make sure everything's secure."</p>

<p>After he sidestepped to a door in the back, Yoshi was, despite himself, drawn like a magnet to that silver canteen. He unscrewed the cap and gulped some down, more shocked that it was stale tasting water all along than at himself for doing that. Thinking back, the toad never reeked of much except fancy cologne. He rolled his tongue around, frowning to himself. It was more than bad tap water, more like..</p>

<p>Yoshi scooted away as the toad reentered the cabin, eyebrows furrowing. "I thought timer meant-"</p>

<p>Floooooosh!</p>

<p>"It did mean that!"</p>

<p>The jet stream mashed both against the wall like Fly Guys on a sticky trap. Cupboards burst open, unleashing tools and any other loose object as the plane lurched downwards. Sonny, upside down, turned to his left, or Yoshi's right, mouthing something during the perilous dive. The blue curtains were blown horizontally, revealing the cockpit, the lack of a pilot, a missing ejection seat, and the glass above that spot gaped open. The nose was pitched at the sea before their aircraft surged upwards, oscillating from the warm and cool air collisions. After they collapsed with all of the amenities, Sonny crawled from under the pile up, scurrying to secure the control column at less than a thousand feet. He could see individual faces of the passengers on a pink and white yacht limping along, partially slashed up from some catastrophic accident that cause there to be a straight line in the ocean, water funneling in the holes.</p>

<p>He prioritized silencing the beeps. All control surfaces were responsive, but the engines were near idle, the throttles stuck with a gummy sort of resistance. Lemon candy.. Ahead was the Mushroom Kingdom, the mountainous side, and he was in trouble with his adrenaline wearing off, making it apparent how heavy all of his muscles were. He mashed the intercom button with the last of his strength..</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Yoshi roused little by little under the unintelligible message blaring over the wind. That chaos had shred away all of the nice furnishing, revealing the bare gray utilitarian walls of the military spy plane. He grabbed whatever he could to shield himself, the wind flapping open his eye lids, until his fingers curled around a smooth hard mask. A painful spark traveled from his digits to his spine, like he touched one of many exposed wires. It was strapped to his face next he knew, his body was clambering over junk to breach the cockpit.</p>

<p>Sonny was slumped back in a co-pilot's seat so oversized for him, Yoshi had room to slip in. The toad's left arm limply clung the controls, keeping them from diving, otherwise paralyzed aside from his bloodshot and beady eyes. The low mounted flight Management System, a device that resembling a calculator with a VFC screen had message instead of waypoints:</p>

<p>"-Push -me- into -the -sea -guide -yourself -down -away -from -town."</p>

<p>Yoshi accepted stoically, heaving the toad up and out the open windows before returning to pretending he knew how to fly. He just wished he could remember how he got there.</p><hr />

<p>No, he wasn't scared of nuthin! Bricks were flying- Pow pow ow, heaps of the Koopa Troop's ammo went off like mines following the earthquake. Roy emerged from his shell and peeked through the crack in his fingers. They coulda used those! By the time the Skylandian toads hit the ground, cut their parachutes and waved their spears, there were hardly any walls left. A big trench in the Earth split Bower Tower down the center, the two parts laying on opposite sides. The pink koopaling was practically on his own on the battlefield. He knew the problem, the lack of his father's fiery passion. He barreled beyond the little toadys to the remains of Bowser Tower, or the Tower of Lyribiris, chucking blocks away until Sky Land soldiers closed in and dragged him away. He had one left!</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Bowser dipped in and out of consciousness. There was a small crack above, the light bleeding from it flickering as objects crossed over, occasionally causing pebbles pelt his body. He propelled himself upwards and smacked into a heavy bulkhead, dazing himself in the cramped pocket of space. Well, he was alive at least. The last couple of minutes was a strange stew he couldn't begin to filter into something comprehensible. All he knew is that he didn't save scrolls, or money from from his tower before it disintegrated. It was something else, held rigidly against his chest, as if it might float away if he let it go.</p>

<p>Suddenly the debris over Bowser slid away, cyan capped toad warriors jumping back. He rose, finding that everything he'd built was gone. The Skylandians that weren't celebrating 'victory' (yeah right!) from their 'Pillar of Understanding' were shoving his paraphernalia, flags, cannons, and laser spitting statues in the bottomless pit.</p>

<p>Any other time he'd release his anguish by melting these losers into a puddle, but he'd lost already. All the clouds were low to the ground or gracing it, revealing a blue sky, and barren fields now held homes and farmland, even a castle.</p>

<p>"Okay okay whatever! You win for now! Where'd you exile my folks!?"</p>

<p>One Skylandian pointed to the South.</p>

<p>"Good!..." He stomped away for a moment.</p>

<p>"King Bowser.." one spoke up.</p>

<p>He whipped around. "What?!"</p>

<p>"You cannot leave. Besides, you are leaving a trail," a different toad, in flasher ribbon threaded clothes stated.</p>

<p>Bowser dropped his gaze to the dried blood all on him, puncture wound, where he'd held the bust. Like the real version of Clarentine, it managed to stab him in the heart for one last measure.</p>

<p>"What do you mushroom freaks want?" he growled through his teeth.</p>

<p>They pointed to a crumbly shine that had just survived the descent from the clouds. Meant for sacrifice, the plaque, in English unusually, was inscribed 'to unknown stars'.</p>

<p>As it all clicked, Bowser sat the bust on the center of the sloping altars.</p>

<p>Then he firebreathed the losers.</p>

<p>Millennium Star was confident in his safeguarding violet aura, proceeding beyond all warnings from Z.A.S with but one regret this far in the deepest channel of the universe. His marginal interpersonal skills deteriorated in crises, so he'd have to make it up some time to Rosalina. As the Lord of and inventor of such, that was a guarantee..</p>

<p>The Dark Realm temple was marked by argentine and reddish rutile spires, five spouting from the ground. No traps activated as Millennium Star flew over, and the Underchomp was audibly confined underground with colossal chains.</p>

<p>He decided to delve into the crafty devil's abode through a barred window. It was disgusting how normal it was inside. Large TV, comfy couch, a laptop on the table. A service tag was slapped on the back cover, the system recently picked up from technicians. He took careful notice of the contact information before he was on his way out, after borrowing a nice bottle of scotch of course from the pantry.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>The Geek Squad's shop was set up on Puzzle Plank Galaxy, which the ancient star found after being beating those mandibugs off of him for a while. The yellow star in the black tie, Aurelius as the tag stated was under wooden shelter, crudely cut somewhere on Grinder Planet, and they were either nomadic or poor and unable to afford to stay in on spot. A pink star partner, Iris, had cables bundled with cheap zip ties and was packing up a test bench.</p>

<p>"Greetings!" Aurelius shook his hand heartily. "How can we help ya?"</p>

<p>Millennium Star presented 'Zachary A. Star's' tag. "Quickly. Enlighten me on this matter!"</p>

<p>Iris pushed her partner aside to squint. "Against policy, buster."</p>

<p>The ancient star made purple coins rain on the geeks. Of course, the ones coated with the entrails of slain cosmic clones were on the bottom.</p>

<p>"He- he- brought it- it- and-" the blurted at once. The yellow star took over, straightening his tie. "-He wanted to deliver food as a gift, heh. Picked up a virus from a scam site until we told him that Greedy Eats' galactic division can do that already."</p>

<p>Millenium Star let that sink in. He was sure he knew the answer, asking anyway, "Deliver to where?"</p><hr />

<p>
  <em>~BREAKING NEWS! Massive earthquake results in multi- Kingdom damages. Oceans lose four percent of volume from underwater canyons..</em>
</p>

<p>Steve zoomed over, spilling his mug of decaf. "Doll, wait!"</p>

<p>How did he know? Well, the vase the redheaded human normally sued to block his line of sight to her from his office was broken, along with the water cooler and the bamboo divider.</p>

<p>"You're already starting weak!" The bullet bill instruviely hovered over her computer screen. "Start with something like.. 'Mario on the run. Friend to Foe -or- Friend to Foe to Friend again?'"</p>

<p>"Yes sir."</p>

<p>Starting over, she counted her blessings. Frightening events were unfolding beyond the walls of the press, though soon enough a heap of King's officers filed their way inside. They were uninjured, so she synopsized in a less than scattered way that they were leaders or cowards. "We need your fax machine, eh."</p>

<p>The human let them have it in the corner, shocked when one of them slipped into the tray and faxed themselves away. She forgot Paper types could do that. A B-Dasher screeched on brakes outside, making a weaselly guard come back inside and sprint beyond her desk to the big board of Toad Town contacts. The driver, a more stout guard barged in and menacingly closed in on him, a mix of anger and agony etched all over her ruddy features. Jessie hid behind a newspaper.</p>

<p>"Did you really think you were gonna walk about with this-" She held up a dog tag. "And expect me to not find out? How did he drown?"</p>

<p>Jon fell to his knees. "He- he- I think he meant to.. So I dragged his body onto the shore, trying to save em and- and- nobody.. He was just a name on a list, scratched off when I told em he wasn't breathing."</p>

<p>She dropped with him, her tears adding to his. "Jon I've.. I'm done."</p>

<p>"Me too, love."</p>

<p>She pulled back. "Wot?"</p>

<p>"I know we're supposed to serve the King, think Toads are better, hate Mario etc, but what does all of that amount to? A couple of mistakes made on one day mattered more than all of the slaving Ben did all year. What's in store for degenerates like us? Bridget, I quit."</p>

<p>She stood, in a bit of a daze. "Jon, you weren't a dick for once. Me too. Chick over there!"</p>

<p>Jessie shuddered as she approached.</p>

<p>"Put this in the papers. I spread that rumor about Mr. Toad. Me." She slapped her badge. "Alight? And no Mario didn't do anything wrong. And also I kissed Peach's manager... Stop looking at me like that. I'm joshin'."</p>

<p>"O-oh." Jessie scooted back.</p>

<p>"Not like that. I did that stuff, I just don't care about your bloody papers."</p>

<p>Kylie Koopa burst out from a cubicle, sliding on the carpet. "I'll take the story anyway peeps!"</p>

<p>Mitch wheeled away from his. "Have at it. I have someone else in mind."</p><hr />

<p>"How did you find me?" the boo growled, lacking into a grimy shady alley.</p>

<p>"It's my job. You had a job too you know and that wasn't sending our kingdom recession over a weekend!"</p>

<p>"Grrrr-"</p>

<p>"But look. It's water under the bridge-"</p>

<p>The Boo growled louder, actually making the mask wearer in green camo pause, quirking a hidden eyebrow. "GET TO THE POINT!"</p>

<p>"Sure," Spy Guy sighed out. He made someone sweep over in the sky with a black triangular glider. A supply box fell from it and clashed on the street, a crate full of rackets with 'W' symbols from the Hotfoot locker. "I'm salvaging this. Give your groupies those and go wild."</p>

<p>On cue, Boo's supporters trickled down the block they'd last seen them dashing down in paranoid fashion. By then Spy Guy had vanished. Booigi wanted to accept the ball thrown into their court and didn't simultaneously, watching them examine the sports equipment. They swung at a mailbox in frustration, launching it off of it's bolted down legs and across the city.</p>

<p>Having the followers ogle, pushed them over the edge. Some of them 'tested' it out by batting at a sign post, Tayce T.'s store window, and a banner for the Dojo. The boo sent the new army over to confront some King's guards while riding high. They volleyed with the projectiles the guards shot, blowing up the sandbags and winning until the tanks came and tore up more of the city to chase them. Parts of Toad Town were becoming war torn, like a Bowser Bomb or two dropped and the eyewitness in the sky had to drop back before the fumes suffocated him or that bizzare figure on the black glider spotted them.</p>

<p>Parakarry landed on MK East's helipad. This area was safe enough, also not so coincidentally where that poor mailbox landed. He reached through the flap, retrieving five thin letters, one a little wrinkly, another a scorched on a corner, all from one local to another. A steady flow of these kept him working through the war. After one more check for that glider, his strong wings lifted him up. With the guards here, the King due to arrive, the infrastructure wearing away, no Peach castle, and up North-</p>

<p>He never saw what hit him, not even the lawn of MK East rapidly approaching as the paratroopa fell like a rock.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Ignoring that thunk against the fuselage, probably them losing the cargo door, Yoshi spun a beige, worn by previous fingers knob to the frequency of the nearest control tower. There was no cause for concern. None, as is plane flew low and slow over the town, or what he saw of it through the mask. He would land this somehow and live and help Mario. And.. and Poochy. Yoshi's son... Wait. Yoshi had a.. Of course he did. Or-</p>

<p>~Bzzzt. "</p>

<p>Who's broadcasting that noise?" someone replied.</p>

<p>"Mayday. Souls on board: 3. Do you read?" Yoshi repeated, equally flat.</p>

<p>"How long have you been in the office?" He spoke to someone else, not acknowledging. That person was another yoshi by voice, so if he could utter a few phrases..</p>

<p>"Forever... errg.. m-mane."</p>

<p>~A worn in chair was plopped on. "Ahhh. Better… They got you on the hard stuff still? When can you get out of that body cast at least, Andrew?"</p>

<p>"Managing.. errg.."</p>

<p>Yoshi wasn't managing to remember a single yoshi phrase..</p>

<p>".. That's not good. Finding 0088 on surveillance like that proves we're avoiding base. Why did I create that policy last quarter? Rodney for instance normally lives here."</p>

<p>"Rodney?" Yoshi repeated, stringing it together.</p>

<p>The airplane dipped in a mini stall, clearing the coliseum so narrowly, Yoshi read ads on banners. He tamed the trills of the wounded bird, trying to land out of the city limits like instructed, likely the Southern Mushroom Kingdom. There was no plan short of keeping her level. There was no iota of fear. Of course, the hero called... himself could do this!</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>On ground level, an elderly toad left the taxi and circled around the young Mushroomites losing the game of rock, racket, super scope blast, bodies flying over her head. Stepping onto the hospital property, she shortly whacked the automatic door. Correcting her crooked shaded glasses, she noticed the sign stating the doors were manual only now, and entered. The lobby, the paths down the two wings, and the receptionist desk was as disarrayed as she left it, except for that hole in the ceiling and the nurses surrounding the downed mailman that had fallen through all three floors.</p>

<p>While he certainly wasn't doing well, she dragged her walker away from that, aiming for another part where conditions were worse. She hung around two staff speaking in the hallway.</p>

<p>"So we stop them from escaping how, Fred?" asked the Crazee Dayzee holding an icepack on his wilted face.</p>

<p>"Build a better lock." The Cobrat wrote something down with his tail. "I'm ordering two-hundred replacements."</p>

<p>"No. Go to room 743 on floor three, and feed each patient 1 oz of Crabbie Grass," the grandma ordered, steely and authoritatively. "It will lesson the psychotic episodes for five hours per dose."</p>

<p>The Crazee Dayzee and Cobrat turned to her.</p>

<p>"Just something I read in a book once, sonny, hehehe.." she shuffled away into an elevator that opened, swiping all the buttons to get away.</p>

<p>The plain-clothed cop on the other end turned remained where he was. If she'd entered the lion's den to be an undercover nurse, he had to find and tell sarge.</p><hr />

<p>"Great thing, those x-rays..He's where?... Thanks for that, lass."</p>

<p>After leaving the mummified with police tape home of Gill T., the perpetually bustling MK East wasn't a relief exactly, but the activity helped to dissipate the tour guide's most doleful thoughts. In Kinopio's room, all his luggage was flipped over, and medical supplies had rattled out of the cupboards. The lime green toad sat with his back towards him, facing the shaded window.</p>

<p>"Time to check out, get our stuff from the hotel, and get outta dodge." The purple toad trudged closer, scoping out some crutches or something to toss at him. "It's a bad sprain, lad. Get up!"</p>

<p>Kinopio was dead still. He'd dug his nails down through the armrest fabric and his lap area was dripping wet. Les slapped the fear status effect out of him, making him gasp and dive to the floor.</p>

<p>"Easy! I'm getting a nurse."</p>

<p>"NOOOO NO! Get me out of here! Now!" Kinopio babbled, crawling to the tray over his bed. He smashed his laptop, the purple toad flinching. Kinopio hobbled to his feet. "It's futility, Lester-chan. Everything!"</p>

<p>The lime green toad ripped down the curtain, unfurling a haunting view of Star Hill, the Mushroomite pilgrimage spot in two halves, indigo trees torn from their roots lining the canyon down to deep in the Earth.</p>

<p>"We know!" Les wrestled him away from climbing out of the window.</p>

<p>The vicinity was spiritually disturbed, and this was the start of it. He managed to press his coworker into a wheelchair, and tapped up his luggage in one big bundle to get out of there. He stuffed everyone and thing into the low mileage Bill Blaster he'd just inherited, the number the 'Mario' decal still on the sides from when the plumber borrowed it Thursday. He dodged the streets with the tanks and roadblocks, took a few back streets and showed up at Hotel Mario without getting stopped by some miracle, though he huffed loudly when none of the staff were waiting in the parking lot.</p>

<p>The bar in was dead outside of the ninji scrolling on a phone so no one greeted Les as he stepped into the stale lodge. The fake plants were scooted to the walls and the bingo games concluded, red dots so scattered about the room had chicken pox. He felt his stomach sink spotting that orange cap from behind, but Tim was himself, sitting on the couch one leg crossed.</p>

<p>"Satiated with what that recovery crap?"</p>

<p>"I suppose Joe and Zeror ought to be," Tim replied with high dudgeon.</p>

<p>He sat next to him. "I don't follow chef."</p>

<p>Tim sat his tea down on the table, facing the purple toad squarely. "Those cursed things Samuel kept in our basement? We lost fragments when the world split in two, then the Toad Brigade kicked me out of their car and fled. Either way Zeror and Joe got ran out of town and I can't say those sneaks didn't deserve it." He got up, taking the plate of cookies too.</p>

<p>Les walked out with him. "We had what in the basement?"</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be a stop on your tours, Les." Outside, the chef gawked at Kinopio, curled up and shivering in the backseat of the kart. Les could only shrug at that. "It's a black tale I wish I didn't remember like my first day, mostly because that is when it occurred, but if you wish to hear it…"</p><hr />

<p>"So a star of that thing does that thing?"</p>

<p>"With less nonce words, indeed, though such is not a quality exclusive celestial deities. Is it not a rite of passage to choose what one shall be and achieve such goals?" He closed the lexicon, casting a curious glance over. The brothers were so comfortable that they could have been at home, at least pre destruction, in the den, warmed by lava jets. The display beyond the tractor beam was dazzling, vibrant nebulas and planets passing by, but their conversation was more interesting in that moment. "What would your virtue be?"</p>

<p>Spontaneously, "I always wanted to be positive and for everyone to be happy so.. I'd be the 'Blithe' star. You?"</p>

<p>"I say with as much self awareness as I can muster- Leucocholy."</p>

<p>"-Um. Luddy?!"</p>

<p>"That means-"</p>

<p>"No. I know what that means. And that's wrong, you obsess over important stuff, but.. What was I saying? Oh yeah, something's happening to you!" Lemmy exclaimed.</p>

<p>Ludwig Von Koopa suppressed his panic at his form glowing, twisting, warping, and stretching. "I am being summoned temporarily, my trusted adjutant. Farewell.. For… now!"</p>

<p>Ignatius Delta rocketed onward with some earpod 'thingies', oblivious to Ludwig's dispersion. Lemmy hugged himself, terrified of the black holes, clusters of poisonous gas, and meteor showers, harassing him until they entered some dark mist. Wrapping around the unidentified galaxy, the tractor beam graced the outer edge of the caliginous atmosphere, where the mist snaked on to a leg and pulled him out of the beam. Lemmy plunged towards a ghastly planetoid of pathos, abound with tombstones and giant bones jutting from the ground.</p>

<p>"AHHHHH!..." He panted. "..Oh nevermind. I think."</p>

<p>Lemmy landed on soft supple soil. Across from that mound was another of damp sand with palm branches, beach umbrellas, and bottles of sunscreen mixed in. Adjacent to that one- He swallowed the lump in his throat and investigated, suddenly respecting his father's decision to not haul them along for that centennial Star Festival invasion. The next mound had their unique Darklandian soil in it. He picked out the old stove of Bowser Castle, the extra large refrigerator half buried, and at the surface, a sealed copy of Princess Parlor on PS4.</p>

<p>He pressed onwards beyond a thick column of bones. Against them were corpses piled thirty or forty bodies high, mutilated often with guts hanging out or ripped away appendages. He recognized a bully line cook, a shy guy messenger #2, a koopa troopa: 15th infantry, and so on, along with strangers, vacationers from their tropical outerwear, collectively draining blood and other fluids, a dark goo rolling down hill and into a massive, ocean-like body of liquid. He'd avoided it by accident on his way there.</p>

<p>He screamed.</p>

<p>"Jeez, everyone reacts like that." A dark boo hammered down a wooden sign. The letters, previously drifting around, arranged themselves into: 'Doom Star Galaxy- Work in Progress'.</p>

<p>Lemmy fell back. "Oh my God. H-how?"</p>

<p>Zoo Diddley shrugged. "I dunno how they're gonna pull it off either, cause I ain't working for FREE! For a price on the other hand.." While holding his temple waved his other half severed arm upwards. Lemmy was suspended in the air.</p>

<p>"Zoo, I don't know how this is happening but I'm sorry! Luddy's sorry too!" he squeaked, spinning around.</p>

<p>"I don't know." Zoo licked his teeth. "I mean I could crush every bone in your body, or pop you like a ketchup packet into space."</p>

<p>"I know but we didn't mean to hurt you or steal or whatever and make weird stuff happen and I know I'm not pleading my case very well but-"</p>

<p>"Silence!"</p>

<p>Lemmy didn't breath either. In space. So appropriately.</p>

<p>"Hmmmm… Alright." He let the koopaling drop and cause a domino effect of clashing tombstones. "I'd hashed it out with Ludwig already. I like seeing ya squirm, hehe. Still weaning of the sadist thing, bro."</p>

<p>"That's okay. Ugh." He groaned. "So Luddy was.. Here? With you? What is this place?"</p>

<p>"A new galaxy, bro! All this shite laying around is from Earth. How she's getting it here I dunno but it's true."</p>

<p>Lemmy couldn't help but to be drawn to those carcasses. "So you didn't-"</p>

<p>"-Not this time. -I mean I did kill some people and trick my brother into painting with their blood once but.. Anyway they were dead when they dropped here. Wanna hear her thoughts?" Zoo went, low and sagacious. "I mean the galaxy's."</p>

<p>Wait 'her'? Well, Lemmy wasn't gonna fall for the 'how is it a she' thing again. "Umm. N-no not really-"</p>

<p>"Too bad!" Zoo dragged him against the gross environment, and slapped the koopaling's forehead. The cacophony Lemmy experienced filter down to a mantra of 'destroy for my beloved' over and over, beating him to a pulp mentally until Zoo let him go.</p>

<p>"Huh. That was actually neat!" Lemmy croaked, holding his head.</p>

<p>"Someone finally appreciates me, bro!"</p>

<p>"Yeah sure but… Excuse me." Lemmy dropped to knees. vomiting all of the blue slurpy in his body.</p>

<p>"Never fear, citizen!" Snifit Patrol ran over with the lights on his helmet flashing. He dropped a huge green anti-nausea mega-vitamin in Lemmy's arms, propping him up. "Take that with plenty of water, young man. I get it. The murders, assault, impersonating a reporter, and fleeing arrest in another dimension? Zoo Diddley is so menacing it makes me sick too."</p>

<p>"HEY!" Zoo rose a finger. "...I was a real reporter. Get it right."</p>

<p>Lemmy blinked at the officer. "I don't think I can drink anything here, but thanks. My brother was looking for you."</p>

<p>"I'll fire a beacon."</p>

<p>"No need..." Lemmy's shaky paws held his phone, taping a message.</p>

<p>Five second later a cyborg shot through the clouds, landing with a tremendous thud. A stringy purple spiny piranha plant was clinched between his teeth romantically.</p>

<p>"Where's the hot Gearmo chick that wants to check me out?!"</p>

<p>His ocular sensors finding no babes, he deflated only to perk up to whatever he was listening to, grooving in place. Fed up, Lemmy yanked those earpods out. Iggy eyed the place as if for the first time.</p>

<p>"~99 errors reported in- Where are we?"</p>

<p>Snifit Patrol shook his hand. "You found me cadet. Excellent! How did it go?"</p>

<p>The genius continued to be besides himself. "How about we converse on the way home?"</p>

<p>He projected from his open palm a new hologram in the shape of a Biddybuggy, built extra strength so that the atmosphere wouldn't affect its integrity and red, so logically faster. While they were getting in, buckling up at the officer's discretion, Lemmy had second thoughts.</p>

<p>"Ian, you really have balls."</p>

<p>"...Thanks?" Lemmy approached. Zoo had crept off to the shoreline of the planetoid, juggling some femurs in the air with telekinesis. "I hope this doesn't count as cursing but I won't 'BS' you. You have problems and I know you know you do but, you still shouldn't be here. Luddy and I are trying to stop this thing. Maybe you could help! Just.. think about it."</p>

<p>The dark boo's shoulders shook, merely silent laughter he was relieved to find. "…Being away from folks is helping me be conscientious bro. Also I've taught myself how to spell that too and more, from picking up brainwaves in space. It's cool. Thanks for the offer thought. Watch your back out there. Really."</p><hr />

<p>"Oh daddy-kins! I only hope I can make you proud!" sobbed the koopaling princess under the dark green sky.</p>

<p>Allowing his heart to open up a smidgen, Roy snuggled her and Junior with a red scarf to his runny nose, and Morton sniffling alike with his large arms.</p>

<p>Wendy had held on so strong, leading the pack to reconvene safely. Most attributed her success to great sophomore year grades and perhaps the fact that she might have been cut out to be a KT general all along. Other Bowser Minions, 500ish as counted, observed sorrowfully on the rocky elevations of Giant Land. Meanwhile, Larry reentered Camp Bowser. He knew an abandoned orange Mushroom House up there held their captives and with the wilderness full of natives that hated baddies in their kingdom, they'd be trying to establish leadership.</p>

<p>He couldn't let that be Wendy. He just didn't know who'd help him out. Junior was ripped away. Peach and Toadsworth were the flippin captives. Kamek and Kammy were on a trip and Bowser was AWOL, the impetus of this mess. He waved to Jade and Jim and other friends of Wendy, and they ran from him. He was a freak as evidenced by his reflection in a pond. Wendy's hair was bleached too though, but her close shave hid it well. All he had then was himself and his dad's instruction to be 'real', his angler.</p>

<p>"-So we've settled on our sister?" Morton threw out there.</p>

<p>"Yes.." minions droned. Wendy clasped her hands, giggling. Junior, under all that elected to keep kneading the scarf.</p>

<p>"This is wack!" Larry sprung up in the middle of them. "Dad wouldn't pick her, or Junior not when.." he desperately tried to word it right. "She's histrionic, dabbling with some crystals and that sorta junk, manifested crazy stuff, and that's why everything went wrong!"</p>

<p>Roy had this foreignly disappointed look, crossing his arms. "Larry, dat was sexist even for me! Sis has been killin it and if we wanna set up so we can start to look for dad, we'd better listen to her."</p>

<p>"And Junior WOULD pick me." The distaff koopaling nudged him, hissing 'PICK ME' through her teeth.</p>

<p>Larry rolled his eyes. "You've locked Junior in the doghouse tons of times."</p>

<p>"It's okay Larry. I.. pick her.." Junior murmured, lip quivering.</p>

<p>Wendy pointed a manicured finger. "Away with thee!"</p>

<p>A sledge brother and a spike tried to pry him off of the rocks. "Someone freaking help!" he yelped.</p>

<p>The lakitu swooped down, trying to look competent, but his cumulus was bright, his balaclava shredded away and his rarely seen visage was soft and youthful besides the short military style moustache. "Sentry 11 reporting. There was a secret weapon disguised as a monument in quadrant 423, Boss. Teach- er Thwomp #3! Back me up!"</p>

<p>A quartz-like thwomp shuffled to the forefront, some whimpering mess. "Eek! ..It was reeeal b-b-ad.."</p>

<p>There was an apparent shift with onlookers, many of which were, maybe, repressing the memory of a black planet eating beam.</p>

<p>Fire shot from the eyes of the koopaling princess. "They're the crazies! And schizo! Secret weapons? Like what? Besides they look all funny, just get them outta here!"</p>

<p>Minions on the spot carried all three and dumped them in a muddy watering hole on outskirts of Camp Bowser. Larry clung to himself, trying to not cry. To be fair that did seem like his typical old sister at the end there, but it couldn't be right!</p>

<p>"Prince Lawrence, man up." Sentry 11 thunked his forehead. "Something's up with the numbers. Boss mighta already been here and I tallied him without knowing I was doing it."</p>

<p>"What?" he sniffled.</p>

<p>"The Voice of the Forest will kindly explain." Thwomp #3 swung him onto his square head and carried him into the brush.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>The lakitu lowered his binoculars. "I've identified 364 distinct types of flora so far, Teach."</p>

<p>"Fascinating J.D. Describe them a little more."</p>

<p>"I ain't a botanist, but there's this and that.." he explained to his old teacher, in sufficient enough detail for a 'not-botanist'. "Yeah, I would plant those myself if I retired."</p>

<p>The thwomp's chin scrunched. "Please enlighten me as to who was on the high rock with Larry."</p>

<p>The sentry struggled with something. "Princess Wendy obviously, Rockhead. Er, Roy…Two.. Others."</p>

<p>"I see that after you moved from Toad Town, you developed that remarkable memorization talent to make up for your face blindness."</p>

<p>"Hey!" Sentry whacked him with a thick branch. "I am 20/20 or else I wouldn't be King Bowser's surveyor! I just pay so much attention to how someone's SUPPOSED to look that I get mixed up if they do something stupid, like wear a hat."</p>

<p>"So, prosopagnosia. You could not 'squash me' sooner because you did not know me under pretence."</p>

<p>He was rewarded with another slap in the face with the branches.</p>

<p>Larry backtracked on them angrily. "Quit already! Where's this voice of the forest?"</p>

<p>"-Voice of the Forest. He is a stickler for proper nouns, and- I am recalling from an acquaintance of an acquaintance, that the community leader is always near to everyone in the kingdom."</p>

<p>Larry stared dubiously. "Quit dicking with me! He's alive right?"</p>

<p>"Indubitably."</p>

<p>"Oh my freakin…"</p>

<p>"Know what, Lawrence?" Sentry spun on them. "I don't trust Rockhead either. It's some scheme. I should fly up and search."</p>

<p>"Don't."</p>

<p>"Gimme one reason, Teach!"</p>

<p>The koopaling could have sworn the quartz thwomp was about to yawn, tempted to hit him himself. "He has an anti-air security system. It is said that one on the ground can listen for his polka classics, projected from a record player he keeps near his window."</p>

<p>Larry had been ignoring some pulsating vibration in the ground. At that he dropped to put his ear to it. He lifted shortly, face broadening. "I know this beat! Come on!"</p>

<p>He followed the beat to a mirage like sight in the brushwood, a blue convertible kart with oversized chrome spinning rims. Dr. Greg rolled back the heavy bass, never moving from the waiting spot he told his fan 'DJ L4rry' he would be.</p>

<p>"Whazup. New look? New crew? Y'all look dope."</p>

<p>"Thanks for being ride or die with me man." Larry greeted Dr. Greg, a Hoenn Pokémon called a Loudred. To the lakitu and the thwomp he might as well had been a purple alien with tiny eyes, yellow lips and large circular ears, in business attire, except for branded headphones hanging around his neck. "Crap went down, so to make this super short, can you help us find this Voice of the Forest dude?"</p>

<p>"Straight up." Dr. Greg flipped up the cover over the 'nitro boost' button. "Hop in."</p><hr />

<p>The rush of acceleration, the breeze in their face, it was great- They'd accidentally stumbled into a picturesque view of the deepest greenest and rural parts of Giant Land, far surpassing the magic and wonder of the 3D maps Peach once kept in her library.</p>

<p>"Wish I brought my camera!"</p>

<p>"Wish I brought.." The caped-toad turned to the kitsune-plumber and back. "Nevermind. I have it."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Just got nostalgic for a sec," Mr. Toad quickly amended.</p>

<p>"Not that." Luigi was checking his phone, not usually the type to just whip out one in the middle of conversation. "That seismic event was felt around the globe. .Mario's phone just warned me about that and more.."</p>

<p>An individual in a tanooki suit caught up with them. "Did I hear that right?" He checked, and it was true, no sort of trap by the King's people or anything, but one of the castle toads using what he thought he'd destroyed. They filed those particulars to memory. "Attributing any of these natural disasters to Bowser is giving him too much credit, but.."</p>

<p>Luigi studied him. " Should we rope Jackson back to us? What are you thinking?"</p>

<p>"No. Let him search for his birds. Just follow me. Okay? Let's-a go!"</p>

<p>They'd never seen a racoon move so fast. Weaving through swarms of heavy para-beetles or ducking under fire chomps, neither tried to stop him either, just scramble mad to catch up. Mario had snapped into that fiery unstoppable mode, one that Luigi was hoping to see that kick in one last time. It tended to be contagious, the sort of thing that made his brother such a treat to work with and by the time they soared into the next continental kingdom, he was shaking- and crushing Toad's hand he grasped.</p>

<p>"It's okay.. Homeboy." Toad okayed, about a half a second before both collided in the back of Mario.</p>

<p>The three heroes plummeted into a super bell tree, getting stuck in the golden bushels of leaves. Toad tore thought a branch to help, just sending them further down. They smacked the ground, a stunningly star filled sky draped overhead.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>A light blue caramel skinned toad, the innkeeper was tipped off about a super shaggy tree. They brushed a few leaves with a rake before hitting something. Mario uncrumpled himself, grateful he chose the hardier of the flight power ups. Luigi under him was a little worse off, losing most of his yellow fur, and Toad even worst of all, practically a pancake.</p>

<p>The innkeeper dutifully kneeled. "Mario, Luigi, and Earl of Mushroom Kingdom, my apologies! Hey Ciri, alert our King!"</p>

<p>Everyone, conscious at least, mistook that for a voice command until another toad, 'Ciri' leaped out of the inn and hustled away. With a closer view at their villa, there were candle holders instead of electric lines and poles, nothing motorized, and simplistic single story designs over all. Ruins of Koopa Troop battlements, that unmistakable ugly grey brick he tended to use and some decapitated Bowser statues remained.</p>

<p>Mario hacked up a few golden leaves. "So I was a little hasty. Which way did the baddies go?"</p>

<p>With some sense of de ja vu, the villager pointed south.</p>

<p>"Perfect." Mario limped a few steps, probably not realizing that he'd lost the bottom half of his tanooki suit.</p>

<p>"Mario, wait. So Bowser invaded here first?" Luigi was fixed towards what appeared to be a ridge, in reality the upward slope of a huge crevasse running up and down the kingdom.</p>

<p>"Affirmative. Our King owes his victory to the awesome and dynamic power of the Pillar of Understanding."</p>

<p>"Oh God.." Mario and his brother gasped.</p>

<p>"Bowser did not fall in it," the innkeeper clarified, quizzical at their disturbance. "Please, take on of our King's inventions for the tirp."</p>

<p>They pressed a short bronze telescope into Toad's hand. Something unreadable was etched into the design. "H-oh. Me? I'm.. I'm honored.."</p>

<p>"Toad you don't look too great." Luigi bent with him, spinning to his brother. "And he's going green again! And his eyes are red!"</p>

<p>"He's not cured from MF?"</p>

<p>"Not totally, but I'm not about to coma walk, homeboy! I just need to rest. Like for five minutes. Go ahead without me."</p>

<p>Luigi's gazed lingered on the Earl. "If you need more time, just take it. Okay? Promise."</p>

<p>"Oh we're promising now?"</p>

<p>"Toad!"</p>

<p>"Yes I promise!"</p>

<p>With a heavy sigh, Luigi joined his brother, sprinting across hills once barren, now littered with debris.</p>

<p>Toad sat on a bench outside the inn all-overish, checking his palms and color repeatedly. Watching the village was agitating, not the Skylandians' fault, it just reminded him how life was back in the day, short of the way the cyan toads were cleaning up. Dumping things in the trench was disconcerting. It had to lead somewhere. Maybe they were polluting Sarasaland on the other side of the world and that would be crappy wouldn't it? He just needed to get out of here and save Peach, and have his hand secured intensely like that again and not shy away from it and-</p>

<p>He accepted that he was a little delirious after all. The wind kicked up, some pink flier slapped him in the face, from Wendy O. Koopa and he read it, actually thinking she was onto something. "She's joining what? I ought do that too!"</p>

<p>"There?" A few Sky Land toads questioned him with veiled disgust.</p>

<p>"Yeah," he explained as more amassed. "I know Neo Bowser City and could do more good for folks there than in my hometown…"</p>

<p>"If you say so, I will support you," chirped Ciri. That got them to be scoffed at for minute, but after some back and forth, the temperature changed in the audience. The news spread through the village down to the king's castle, which Mr. Toad could spot.</p>

<p>He could also spot, driving over an embankment, with wobbly tires and smoke from the hood...</p>

<p>Toad checked through that Vrlrdyi Scope, the crude x4 view, confirming his worst nightmares.</p>

<p>He leapt from the bench, collapsing right after. He rolled onto his back as he was gathered around. "Hey Ciri. Get me outta here!"</p>

</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The luma
was fixed to the main console display of the Comet Observatory,
flashing red as an indicator of abnormal energy in the galaxy.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong mama? Is it King Bowser??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Imagery
sprung of Bowser&rsquo;s lethal relentless doomships that stripped
them of their power stars and nearly left them drifting and powerless
in space.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Blushing,
the goddess leaned and hugged them tight. &ldquo;Nothing to worry
about..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Another
lie stinging her lips. &#9825;&#9834;!? stalled others by
conveniently requesting a tour. She coveted how guileful he could be
on a whim, pausing, pointing out a galaxy, telling a story, and using
his vast experience as a heavenly justice enforcer to keep them at
bay. Unfortunately everyone was rounding back around in time for the
energy at the core to flicker out. Rosalina felt the pinch of a
headache coming on, her experimental Gravitational Pull soul transfer
technology wavering-</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
understand your affinity for the Earthlings Miss Rosalina, but surely
you can do better than this..&rdquo; Stuffily, Polari accelerated
towards the Observatory launch pad where a new visitor, healthy,
lacking sluggishness, corneal clouding, or livor mortis
discoloration, regained his bearings and stalwartly faced the
accusing star.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Not
sparing an explanation he decked the black dwarf. Stepping over his
grumbling body, he fired at his divine helpers a stern, &ldquo;May we
talk?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&#9825;&#9834;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">!?
Swung his arm around the Koopa Troop commander. &ldquo;-About that
pizza we ordered. Move along kiddos, we need to show this guy where
the change is at!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig was
shuffled across a red carpet path, into a heavily decorated purple
building with gold trim around the entrance. Geno had a key,
suggestively, to enter that bedroom. A second later, Rosalina
followed them, relocking it. Ludwig tripped over the step and fell
forwards onto the soft made up canopy bed. Furiously he rose up and
glared at the other two, wagging the open lexicon.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
have familiarized myself more with those mythical &lsquo;Special
Objects&rsquo; scanning the glossary of this than your entire prep
talk. I especially appreciated the lack of forewarning that I was
susceptible at random to dark star influence. If reminiscences of my
brother didn&rsquo;t taper its hold on me, I shudder to imagine what
might have occurred at that critical moment.&rdquo; He shut the book,
the thick pages making a bop noise. &ldquo;To be concise, you two
would fit in with the more lousy of my college professors..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Rosalina,
holding an indistinguishable expression, turned to the star warrior.
&ldquo;My, he found his Special One.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
flushed bright red. &ldquo;Miss-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-It&rsquo;s
genuine love in general,&rdquo; &lsquo;Geno&rsquo; explained
preemptively. &ldquo;Romantic, family, platonic, whatev. You and Ian
are tight right?.. Or Lemmy, as I just recalled he prefers. My bad.
Just has to be love in its realest form, as real you are shacked up
here with us. -And you are really here so shut up and sit down
child!&rdquo; With a flick of his fingers, he flung Ludwig across the
room and into the wall next to the electric fireplace. Indeed he
physically felt it!</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Here&rsquo;s
a better version than that 109th edition watered down trash anyway.&rdquo;
Geno snapped. A spark landed on the retail book, upgrading it to
ancient papyrus scrolls. &ldquo;Agents of the dark star don&rsquo;t
usually come out of the woodwork to trigger the artifacts and
sacrifice portions of your planet in one Earth day, so forgive my
brevity before. Not having Millennium Star, the one that knows Great
Eld the most, put a toll on us.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The color
drained from the koopaling&rsquo;s face, the scrolls unraveling and
bouncing around. &ldquo;I..see. Could you.. Start from the top?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Geno
became resigned at this type of tale. &ldquo;So in the beginning,
lots of stars roamed your Earth as gods among the mortals kinda, and
the morality of some weren&rsquo;t so great. After Eldstar was like
&lsquo;enough&rsquo;, there were artifacts left behind that, prior to
the star's death, they&rsquo;d infused a part of them in it. There
wasn&rsquo;t much of a deal &lsquo;cause only somebody with psionic
power or a really strong connection with stars could make them react
in any way. Isolated situations in history where all the ingredients
came together were a drop in the bucket of the &lsquo;strange&rsquo;
that&rsquo;s commonplace in your universe. That&rsquo;s why we
weren&rsquo;t that versed on it. That&rsquo;s why things like the
Lexicon were the only surviving articles still speaking about it,
which few believe in your times, etc. Cue your janitor though, who
revived a very specific star. According to Rosie&rsquo;s console,
it&rsquo;s rallying all the other objects and amassing-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-With
all due respect, Rosalina, open up!! Quickly!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Higher
Authority, give me strength..&rdquo; Geno grumbled. Rosalina&rsquo;s
gentle touch on his rising shoulders kept him from Geno Blasting
Polari through the door and likely setting her bedroom and part of
the Observatory on fire.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Rosalina
cracked it open. Her heart sank, the secrecy of this mission
impossible to contain with Toadsworth&rsquo;s arrival. He was curled
up on the ground beside Polari.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Eldstar
forgive me...&rdquo; After he didn&rsquo;t respond further, they
brought the elderly toad to the observatory's fountain dome, dipping
him into the cool water.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Do
not attempt to cross the alluvion.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh,
no worries. I wouldn't with out the Marios around, er, folks-&quot;
Toad kept himself from the typical 'homeboy/girl' with this very
contemporary and genderless group of Skylandians. Not being able to
shoot the crap with these helpful dagger carrying warriors was the
least of his problems. He needed for them to leave him alone and not
notice his worsening arrhythmia.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
wish I could meet them!&quot; Many comrades agreed, strolling off,
leaving him at the bank.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Great, he
waved them off until the brush hid their light blue caps. At that
point he tossed away the ice pack and plunged into the river,
careening him though Giant Land uncontrollably. While getting drowned
nearly, he smacked against rocks and was poked by Spear Guys. His
best plan this was not, but he couldn't waste time following koopa
tracks, nor hit up Jr. Troopa, not with their last awkward conversion
looming over him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jr. Troopa
replied to &lsquo;Call this from now on -Toad&rsquo; with:</font></p>
<p><em>&lsquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey..
u didn&rsquo;t answer something..&rsquo;</font></em> 
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Like a
dunce Toad replied </font><em>&lsquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What?&rsquo;</font></em>
<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A few times.</font></p>
<p><em>&lsquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">U
like beards or not?&rsquo;</font></em> 
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
didn&rsquo;t reply then.</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Taking
that as a yes. What d u like ab them? Length, color, goatee,
mustache?&rsquo; Troopa continued to press. &lsquo;*laughing emoji*
jk jk&rsquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It hit
Toad like those Iggy&rsquo;s Castle pillars, that Troopa was teasing
him. He had to continue the hard way, paddling like mad, to tell
Luigi and Mario about what he saw with the &lsquo;Vrlrdyi Scope&rsquo;,
which was&hellip;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Recalling
the sight, his vision whited out- it was happening again! He lost
sensation as the river swept his body further along. Coming to,
floating belly up in an unknown area, a Boss Bass was on his tail.
Toad rose his arms in surrender. The fish tied on a tidy clean apron.
Toad then went &lsquo;psyche&rsquo; and dipped beneath the behemoth,
letting it pass over. He rose to the surface, watching it barge
through a log spanning the river and over the waterfall.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Waterfall?
He screamed.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hint Toad
crouched at the bank with the tranquility and shrewdness of a
documentary host. &quot;-Here in this quadrant of Giant Land, the
aquatic species include the emerald cheep-cheep, boss bass, Unagi,
and Mr. Toad as we see, kindly demonstrating in real time why it is
unwise to swim across.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Heinemann,
thank you. That was an opportune comment for once! J&ouml;rg, you are
unoccupied (as usual..) fetch the good man. Captain's orders!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A rope
landed over Toad's shoulders, his lips not quite parting enough to
utter his surprise as Yellow Toad tugged him out of the rapids.
Multicolored toads crowded him as he coughed up more water. They had
full heavy backpacks and a treasure filled utility wagon immobilized
by rocks at the wheels.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Mr.
Toad, why would you burden yourself to pursue Bowser?&quot; Banktoad
gave the wet bloated toad another once over. &quot;That is what you
were doing, right?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yeah.
Thanks.&quot; Toad rose up, picking the fancy, appeasing to the eye,
Vrlrdyi scope with him. Something mysterious settled over the brigade
members. They stared at it, hesitant to say anything until The
Captain returned shortly, tossing a giant tree to create bridge 2.0.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad hid
his 'treasure' behind his back consequently, noticing how Stan was
far stronger than he ever was in his heyday and, unsettlingly,
starting to look more like him as he was inadvertently weathered by
adventures and age. Well, besides the fresh looking scar that ran
down his manly brow ridge, creating a faint 'plus' symbol almost.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Mr.
Toad, take a gander at this.&quot; The Captain patted the trunk,
making it rock. &quot;Would you prefer to walk or ride?.. Ride it
is!&quot; he answered for Toad, proceeding to address Mailtoad. &quot;We
can make space by shedding those soulless commercial boxes.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mailtoad
flinched. &quot;I ..uh.. Thought those Koopa Troop documents were
fascinating and worth preservation but.. Yes Captain..&quot; He
unloaded a beige file cabinet, giving Toad a better view of their
overabundance of Bowser and Skylandian materials.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad knew
it. It wasn't about being a Mario brother aide, at least not over
treasure hunting, or since many could be dead, grave robbing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Everyone
is digital these days anyway, Mordecai. Your bottled notes may remain
however. That fits our aesthetic. Onward we go!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
simmered as the others were crossing the log bridge, aware of The
Captain hovering over his shoulder. &quot;Stan, I know the long and
the short of it. Luigi's gonna hear about this.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hm?&quot;
he replied mischievously. &quot;Why not Mario?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;He's..
You know he's in charge of everyone on this mission, powerups, and
spoils-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Including-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad went
'wtf' at The Captain's hand gracing his back, sliding where the
Vrlrdyi Scope was tucked in his rear pocket. &quot;Back off you f-.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;What?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Nothing.&quot;
Flushed, he put a little distance between them. &quot;Look. I was
given that willingly.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;T'was
cursed, I see.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;NO!...&quot;
Toad thought for an uncomfortable second. &quot;Or.. still no! I'm
cool with them and I just don't know how to use it right. By the way,
I'm.. antsy. Just being revived today and all. Just don't touch me.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Very
well. After this.&quot; The Captain pushed him hard, thee Earl
tripping into the treasure wagon.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad was
instantaneously carried off. It wasn't The Captain's prowess or
unwavering ambition that made him intimidating. It was, to Toad at
least, how casually he viewed his loyalty to the kingdom. Peach tried
to knight the brigade once and- thank goodness they would go on to
shrug that off. Only a couple of things made Stan click, prospecting,
gallant feats that might include the former, and exploiting
somebodies vulnerabilities. Toad knew he had more right then than
what was physically keeping him from abandoning ship.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
Captain joined his crew in turbo mode, tramping through brush and
high grass in a line. &quot;Brigade, let's remind Mr. Toad that, yes,
we can fight bad guys like we used to.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Didn't
we defer that work to Mario most of the time? And aren't we only
tracing Bowser because he has an expensive looking lapis bust we
want?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
Captain punched Yellow Toad. &quot;And isn't it time for you to
simultaneously walk and sleep again?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Zzzzz.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Better.&quot;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
evening sun tinted the haze of recently expired conflict orange.
Northern Toad Town, The Post Office, the local Inn, the item shop,
the library, and numerous other places were waterlogged empty shells.
Booigi would like them better as soot and ashes, but a Faucet Thing
sticker foiled that wish.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-You
cannot quit. You. Cannot,&rdquo; they snarled at the ten or so
hobbling off.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
shameful koopa dropped his racket. Banged up and chipped, it was
constructed of gray graphite and branded with a &lsquo;W&rsquo;
symbol, the logo for some obscure brand. More significant for those
brandishing this, it didn&rsquo;t have special &lsquo;launch victim
into orbit&rsquo; or &lsquo;shatter on contact&rsquo; powers like
Booigi&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Yeah. -Oww.&rdquo; He winced and held his
neck. &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t made of.. Whatever you are Boo-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Booigi
the Second.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Right.
Right.. Oww..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">At last it
appeared it had become too demoralizing for the supporters that only
Booigi could engage the King&rsquo;s guards and come out unscathed.
Every battle around town the boo lost a few, not counting anyone
arrested, fined and/or brought to the slammer, and here went the
final group</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Go
away then. Go!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The motley
bunch scurried into the nooks and crannies of town. Booigi was
already the change that was needed. All them. The others just.
Couldn&rsquo;t. See it. Puzzlingly King&rsquo;s guards were scarcer
to locate and they could not determine where they vanishing. They
didn&rsquo;t skip town was certain, nor were any more arriving per
local reports on the message boards, which came out exceptionally
fast and timely from the Mushroom Press. (Deciding for another layer
of mystery that they&rsquo;d have an internet presence now.) They
were simply going to have to patrol for them, zipping up familiar
childhood lanes. Familiar to &lsquo;Boo&rsquo; at least, not so much-</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hold
it, speedy..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They found
a middle aged dark green toad in the middle of the street, the only
living thing in a few blocks. Booigi ii huffed before the civilian.
&quot;I would stay indoors.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
laughed, his voice deepening. &quot;I know we all look alike, dude..
I was at the park. Mitch. Ring a bell?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Booigi
tilted their head. Mitch had hives on some of his exposed skin, and
despite his admirable effort to look sharp in a new suit, evidence
remained of a nosebleed issue by the wads of towels in his pocket.
His cold calculating eyes, one slightly askew, bore into the boo,
their vaingloriousness draining from the puncture.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
continued, &quot;I had to, you know deal with insurance and arrange
for a new car to be dropped off today. No big deal. Now I have an
offer you cannot refuse. Roll with me, baby.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Huh?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He sighed,
continuing down the kartless street. &quot;Hey kid. I'm trying to
make the best of this confined to a wheelchair thing. Don't.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No,
I didn't mean..&quot; Booigi followed reluctantly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Great
job whipping those Poshley toads into shroom shakes. Thing is, inside
scoop here, some local spoiled mushrooms aren't better. Peach is a
linchpin, hear? Just replace those guns and tanks with fire flowers
and stones and you're looking at some of your neighbors, still around
pretending to be model Mushroomites. It's an outrage!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;It
is!&quot; Booigi tensed, agitated all over.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Listen,
you could do something about it while Peach isn't around. Think
everybody knows you in Toad Town? Talk about the Mushroom World come
tomorrow!&quot; he chuckled. &quot;I love this diner. In here.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mitch
pressed the handicap door button to Club Gamecube, that other eatery
across the street of Club 64. Booigi blanked out apparently, they had
strayed back into normal portions of Toad Town, where some citizens
of all sorts were still walking about and only a few saw Booigi and
clapped admiringly or fled to alert the police. Booigi impulsively
ducked inside the eatery. There was a bartender stocking up and a
dozen patrons far back, otherwise no one at the waiting room but
Chuck the spike, seated like a doll or something. Odd, he said he was
not going to deal with Boo anymore, rather go home to his mother.
Besides that a purple Gamecube laying around in a high chair.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh
look who's here. See, that guy's fine with me. Actually, some toads
are too, like Dr. Toad. Red capped, blonde, as quintessential as a
toad comes... Not a problem tho. (Nor is he all toad anyway.) We'll
get something kid, and talk about the problematic ones-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Have
you been served?&quot; someone gruffly cut in.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Booigi
scanned around fruitlessly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
sentient Gamecube shuffled the menus at the podium. &quot;Over here.
I am the manager. I know it's strange,&quot; it groused.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mitch
slapped a one-hundred coin bill on his counter. &quot;Keep the
change.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Booigi and
the others passed beyond the velvet rope, in the main room where
there were dim lights and lounge music. They sat in between Mitch who
rolled up to the bar edge, and the spike, drooling, dazed, before
ordering tea.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Tasty
Tonic!&quot; Mitch barked, swiveling to Booigi. &quot;So, now that we
can get into specifics, let me exclusively chronicle your war on
toads connected to so and so...&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;There??&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yes.
I have access to the lists that used to work in the castle. You'll
get sixty percent profit back, that's right, I'm cutting you the
bigger slice. Deal?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Booigi
weightily tapped against the bar table. &quot;And I only need to
attack pedestrian toads..&quot; It had cryptically bitter aftertaste,
and they didn't know why. Logically it was sound, even if it included
some toads their other personality knew, like Russ T.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-You
wouldn't question that if I showed you this.&quot; Mitch's open palm
rested on Booigi's forehead. As a reflex they went intangible which
failed. &quot;Count backwards from ten,&quot; he whispered, his tone
dark..</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Why?&quot;
Booigi hunkered down, fighting against the dread overtaking them. The
entire room then had their faces blotted out, the lines remaining but
smeared beyond recognition. They continue to scrap a plate, sip a
beverage, or chat, oblivious to their struggle. Booigi submerged into
the floor, through the building's pipes, into the crust of the
planet, down, down, into the core, now burning, so agonizingly, no
matter how much they wailed in their mind that it wasn't real. It was
like dealing with- another boo.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Boo
E. Diddley&quot; Mitch said to the boo, still in the seat and
trembling in reality. &quot;C'mon. Count.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No!&quot;
Booigi spat with difficulty. &quot;Get.. your.. Paws.. off.. me!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He went,
'tisk'. &quot;I was gonna make picking your brain pleasant. Now I'll
just actually do it.&quot; His abominable abilities prevailed over
their incorporeal boo biology as he physically poked their squishy
frontal lobe.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-I
know better than to intrude after last time.. As I was saying wake up
or you will be excluded..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
drowsily tossed the pillow next to him at the girl in the open
doorway.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
huffed, adjusting her silver wig, clamped in a ponytail by two pins.
&ldquo;Dont ruin my makeup!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He turned
over, stripped of some covers and peeped with one eye. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
worry, homegirl. You still look like&hellip; what are you again?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Goomelda?
The wisest of female goombas?&rdquo; She leaned against the inner
door frame, indignant. &ldquo;Mr. Toad, I&rsquo;ve told you before
that for every Rebotco Fest, I will liken myself to someone
important, underappreciated, and in our mushroom genus so that I can
educate the other celebrants and simultaneously remain stylish and-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Alright
already!&rdquo; He rose out of bed, revealing his snow themed red and
green polka dot pajamas. He didn&rsquo;t even match the holiday it
was in that regard. &ldquo;Sure you didn&rsquo;t want an excuse to
wear a kimono?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Certain.
I better like, head down. I want to meet every guest coming in so
they don&rsquo;t miss out on a learning opportunity.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The pink
toad dressed as a scholarly goomba icon scampered off. Toad slid out
of bed, gigglish. Toadette was adorable when worked up over nothing.
A doorbell resonated though Peach Castle. Maybe it was something.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Overextending
his afternoon nap, that meant it was almost eight. He debated between
that much hated, meant to be renovated but hadn&rsquo;t yet, medieval
communal shower, where at basement level the water was more steamy or
his personal bath in the third floor bedroom, where it took
considerably longer for the water to become a quarter as hot. He
opted for efficiency over comfort and freshen up with lukewarm water,
still drying off as he hurried back to his half messy triple king
sized bed. Always only the left side where he habitually slept. The
opposite had never been occupied&hellip;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He laid
out flat a jumper he&rsquo;d purchased and accessorized to resemble
Prince Froggy. Aside from collaborating with Kamek, Toad admired how
chill, kind to his subjects, and carefree he was.. Also green.
Looking down from his high window, costumed friends were making their
way across the lawn of Peach Castle. A Mach Bike among them got him
excited. He moved away to preserve the surprise a little longer. He
had no qualms spilling the beans honestly, but while he and Luigi
were hanging out earlier today, just out in the lawn talking (they
didn&rsquo;t really do exciting things or stray from the house much,
and that was just fine) as Mario was on his back cursing in Italian
while fixing on the motorbike for the umpteenth time, the green
plumber danced around the topic of what he was arriving as.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
zipped up and practiced his frog hop on the way down. While the third
floor had no d&eacute;cor, the castle steadily shifted into a pumpkin
zone with orange confetti, glow sticks, autumn leaves, and
frightening cut-outs by the second. Big Boo&rsquo;s music box
blasting through the stone walls by the ground level. In the front
hall guests conversed around the tables holding refreshments or on
the mezzanine, leaning over and watching others. The princess
insisted they compartmentalize this year's party in here, the
kitchen, the aquarium, and the second floor den. Plus at midnight
they&rsquo;d better scram. It wasn&rsquo;t a favorite holiday for her
nor Toadsworth and it went south when they got more elaborate, like
hosting hide and seek tournaments. Yoshi still made off comments
sometimes about how he had to spend the night on the roof&hellip;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad slid
down the rails just in time for that distinctive rising of voices
when the Mario bros entered a building. Mario&rsquo;s costume... it
didn&rsquo;t even register really. It was Luigi he couldn&rsquo;t
stop staring at, a white helmet under his arm, waving shyly, eyes
darting around for somewhere to escape this loud busy scene, wearing
a perfect replica of a white armored Starfighter from </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Star
Slammers</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">,
a more geeky, hard sci-fi alternative to Toad Force V. Toad thumbed
towards upstairs to the left, the den, where Luigi and anyone else
less social could retreat and or watch Thrills at Night: The Movie
and not open themselves for potential ridicule from anyone over
&lsquo;secluding themselves from the party&rsquo;. Luigi caught his
signal, winked, and moved on.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Before
Toad followed, partygoers parted, letting him discern the crowd more.
As with many events people coupled up a lot. Mario, a pumpkin head
bat thing, and fans were around a crone, Peach. Toadette had
apparently educated enough so she was with Bucken-Berry, a Chargin
Chuck (likely a veiled way to get to tackle folks and get away with
it), and Ala-Gold was their third wheel, dressed, if it could be
considered such, as a green pipe so that people could toss their
candy in it and not realize it has feet, plus so on. Toad
involuntarily sighed as another person cleared security and got in,
the famous outdoorsmen Captain Toad, as.. &lsquo;Mr. Toad&rsquo;.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
splitting image, same shave, matching dye job, perfectly modulated
voice, so complete Toad, frozen the mezzanine noticed a pattern in
'himself' and interactions with certain ones, usually taller.. with
facial hair.. He concede that it would be more weird if he didn't
interact with the doppelganger raising everyone's cholesterol levels
at least once.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
caught up to him, next in line to play some dart game. &quot;Hey,
Stan. Looking handsome today.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Can't
say the same!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Jerkface!&quot;
Toad cracked his knuckles.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Says
the warty frog.&quot; 'Mr. Toad' struck the red center for max points
the first time. He was awarded a plastic wrapped Honey Shroom from
Zeror, dressed as Merlon (ironically as laical he was).</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Haha..
Oh yeah. Well, that's Prince Warty Frog to you!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He'd
commit to the bit for sure. Creepy but.. he had to have an eye for
detail to get it right, which Toad always admired in someone. It was
all too easy to look at a toad, in particular the red ones and paint
them with broad strokes. He knew him being not so docile made him and
individual among his ilk, so was The Captain imitating him recursive?
..He was way into his own head then. Either way, long as his loony
fan didn't do anything crazy he could stan, like his name.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Alright
I'm heading upstairs. You're annoying. Rude. Hammy. Not acting your
age. Yep, looks like you got my characterization as straight as
possible.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Phrasing,
homeboy.&quot; The copy smirked, spinning around. &quot;There's
nothing 'straight' about you.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With a
twitch, Toad socked The Captain. In slow-mo he smacked the
checkerboard tiles, the prize flying out of his hand and at Zeror,
who reeled backwards into a shy guy, who was actually a snifit who
collided with a yoshi who was actually a birdo who knocked over a
birdo who was actually a yoshi who flipped the entire drinks table
over Peach and Toadsworth coincidentally walking by. Gallons of punch
covered the entire room and soaked many in deep red syrup that never
washed out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad was
banned from that event from then on.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Someone
I recognize, finally,&quot; someone said, heavily German accented.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">'J&ouml;rg',
or Yellow Toad's boots were on the soapy floor, castle toads pushing
clear furniture for the next phase of cleanup behind him. He wore his
adventurer's outfit, no costume and no orange pass marking him a
permitted guest.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad was
on the steps, back in his pajamas, feeling both too sick to sleep or
do anything at once. The clock said it was near midnight and
weightlessness took over as the yellow toad sat next to him. &quot;W-what
are you doing here?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yellow
held this funny, slightly embarrassed, slightly something else look.
&quot;Just something I can do. Stanley is insensitive, we know. We
tolerate and try to making him a benign asset because he's William's
uncle principally. My sincerest apologies he ruined this event.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
skeptically scooted away. &quot;What is even happening??&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;In
your depression you overgorged on leftover candy, didn't you?&quot;
the lazy, or ostensibly so adventurer prodded.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;..Whatever.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Let
me lighten the mood. If your dreamscape reached the rooftop, I would
gladly go up there and perform all of Britney Spearguy's dance moves.
It's not like my crush would know. When I'm in his dreams I don't
flail like an idiot, or tell him I like him obviously, not with his
religion-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
tossed another wrapper into a trash bag tied to the newel post. &quot;If
this really is in my head, hush already man.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Of
course. He's way out of my league anyway, like yours's-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Mine
isn't out of my league!&quot; Toad shot back. &quot;I mean, I don't
have a... It's not a toad,&quot; he muttered low. &quot;That's the
bigger deal. I can't even pull the- 'we're technically all fungi'
thing.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yellow
nodded understandingly. &quot;Mr. Toad-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad shot
to his feet. &quot;Huh, well I feel better already vaguely describing
my problem without having a real solution yet... Security!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-This
isn't happening!&quot; Yellow Toad cried, being slung into the cold
outside by Bucken-Berry.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Couldn't
take that risk.&quot; Toad downed one more lemon candy, lifting from
the green wrapper to find a pressure washer nozzle 'accidentally'
aimed his way. Suddenly he remembered how that crazy night ended.<br/>
&hellip;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad woke
up- dry- but cramped in an awkward angle in the gear wagon. Looking
around, they were on a cliff surrounded by chiseled rock faces, high
enough where something got in his eye the moment the breeze picked
up. After some somber earnest thought he discreetly texted Jr. Troopa
for some gosh dang help. He replied right back with where he needed
to go, no harsh feelings. Toad settled a little more and tacked on.
'Btw, beards r fine. Moustaches are bttr.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He tumbled
out and rolled against Yellow Toad, standing upright and sleeping.
The other brigade members scanned around with handheld detectors.
Toad grabbed the unused one of Yellow, silently thanked the pudgy
weirdo, and crept to the edge. He saw the koopas far down with
something ominous going on, also much smoke. The brigade could only
be deliberately avoiding that, proving what he already knew. He
unfolded the cape mercifully still around his neck and leapt off
while they weren't looking. He flew&hellip; for twenty feet, then it
was more of a free-fall.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
trekked to the fortress again on foot, over chomping munchers,
sneaking around native homes, crawling through dense bush, and
ducking from swoopers, until they burst upon a semi-cleared out piece
of civilization, the fortress with the smoke beacon. It was actually
some guy's house.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">If
only I had the foresight to take the phone from Toad before he left.
We could just tell Jackson to, you know, have that security system
deactivated.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad&rsquo;s
probably goofed off and installed Thrice Candy Crush Saga.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Give
him some credit,&rdquo; Luigi snapped, flushing. He was starting to
worry about his friend, worry about if they&rsquo;d make it the
fortress this time, and worry about how his brother was so
discombobulated, likely thinking about how it might go down with
Bowser, he&rsquo;d walked the last mile without his hat and with his
shoes on the wrong foot.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Beyond the
sign stating: &ldquo;Hear ye, Voice of the Forest&rdquo;, a two
storied log home had satellite dishes, solar panels, and swerving
surveillance cameras on the roof, highly illuminated as night crept
on by the electric powered stadium lights. On the ground were laser
trip wires and old fashioned barb-wires surrounding the property.
While the recently cut grass held nothing, a sour greasy smell of old
tools, stale oil and gas was strong.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">In their
normal wear, they crossed the laser barrier, anxiously preparing for
anything. Mario had claimed beforehand that he&rsquo;d put up a game
of Roshambo to thwart that mechanical hand, and Luigi bet against
that, either way that would go unresolved as nothing happened.
Insects were their only fierce enemy left as they stepped on the
porch. The lamp was lit. The window had a blue glow. Luigi felt his
heart thump, hesitating to reach for the buzzer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He yelped
when Mario tapped him, sheepishly.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-I
left behind my duffle bag when we changed out of those powerups.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Face
palming, &ldquo;Mario, first your new phone, now-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It
is safely here,&rdquo; said a fellow Mushroomite by accent. The bag
landed in between them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
brothers spun into Larry Koopa, all blanched out, wearing Luigi&rsquo;s
spare overalls that dragged the floor, Sentry 11 in a red shirt, and
Thwomp #3 with a drawn on mustache and the M cap. The bare essentials
to exploit a rudimentary computer algorithm set to destroy anyone who
isn&rsquo;t a &lsquo;plumber.&rsquo; To see Larry rebel or do
something sneaky wasn&rsquo;t unusual, it coming together here and
now rather was baffling. Before Mario could comment on who they
blatantly were, Luigi covered his mouth. Someone was stomping closer
and a second later, a mega goomba with a hunter&rsquo;s cap, busy
goatee, and bloodshot eyes kicked the door off the hinge.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
told you Bowser Freaks to stay away!!! I don&rsquo;t care if y&rsquo;all
are wondering what to do while wandering around in the forest cause
you&rsquo;re lost and confused and lost three of your biggest leaders
confusing my chimney smoke for the your dagnabbit ceremonial- &rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Whoa
nelly! Don't X92 these folks.&rdquo; A little breathy from exercise
earlier, someone with a shirtless ripped physique and camo pants and
combat boots, a bandana, and a knife strapped to his thigh, squeezed
outside.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario did
a double take. &ldquo;Jackson, wow, this is a fortress?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
promptly shrunk into a dork. &ldquo;You mean the best one yet. It can
look like anything Mario, as long as you keep it sanctified&hellip;
Or is that saying about temples? Anyway, why did you speak Japanese
and then hang up when I tried to call you before?&rdquo; He nagged.
&ldquo;Nevermind. This is the fortress/ home of the Voice of the
Forest aka Dr. Richard Goomba Sr. PhD. This guy is an off the grid
post apocalypse icon I tell ya.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Like a
switch flipped the mega goomba became almost normal with a polite if
exhausted smile. &ldquo;First year nurses always get so enamored....
Ah hem. I see you are indeed heroes with such getup. I hope I did not
disturb you with my abhorrence of Bowser freaks. I loathe them. I
wish to not see them. Ever&hellip;And I'll destroy them on sight.
Anyway, welcome to my abode!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Plastering
on a smile in return, the plumber gang stepped in. Richard Sr. seated
himself at a comfy couch next to a newspaper covered window. The
cable television was next to it, the source of that glow, and across
from that he had doctorates on the wall, a human skeleton, a vinyl
player, a portrait of a younger grumpy goomba wearing a bowtie, and
an additional CRT that was set to a grid with dots on it. The
landline went off once while everyone filed in. He&rsquo;d answered,
hummed and hung it up.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Nurse
Troopa,&rdquo; he went, hiding impatience. &ldquo;Your presence for
the past few hours was exquisite, now I must now ask you and your
associates to state your purpose.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His direct
command caught them off guard. Then-</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Where&rsquo;s
my- where&rsquo;s.. That awful Bowser guy??&rdquo; Larry volunteered
first.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Richard
Sr. consulted that grid screen, able to read it in a way they didn&rsquo;t
understand. &ldquo;There are 497 KT in our mountains.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That&rsquo;s
where they are, right now?&rdquo; Luigi emphasized.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yes.
I cannot divulge specific identities however. Heed this. I &lsquo;speak&rsquo;
for this great proudly rural kingdom via my telecommunication. A
plethora of my neighbors, and we do stick up for one another,
recounted when they saw one. From this I was able to mark the spots
on my digital map. I&rsquo;ve already set up a portal there.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh,
another thing,&rdquo; Jr. Troopa spoke up. &ldquo;Dr. Goomba is also
responsible for the Portal Gun, which is how his son&rsquo;s crew, ya
know The MKDCU travel around the world in five minutes.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Isn&rsquo;t
that the wrong game?&rdquo; Luigi asked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Troopa
turned to Luigi. &ldquo;Not when a Pok&eacute;mon was seen driving
around here. Dr. Goomba used his special missiles for that one.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
meanwhile coughed up some nuts and bolts.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;m
going to have to see that to believe that.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The goomba
swung back a curtain to a pantry, empty, stuffy, and with an orange
oval embedding in the way. Mario believed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ogling
around the space, the view was too wavy to validate where it was
going visually. Luigi boldly surprised everyone by peeking through
first. Mario held his breath, it only lasted a few seconds when
leaned back in, radiant and determined.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Doctor,
since you live off the grid, do you keep a surplus? May we borrow
some?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Shortly
the Mario bros dove in with a pallet under a tarp. Despite it being
wider than the portal, it all fit somehow. Larry lingered behind as
they disappeared, contemplating, anguishing, and panicking alike
until he formed a puddle of sweat he hoped no one noticed. By the
grandfather clock&rsquo;s time the ceremony had commenced. If his
father was gone, could he allow his family to crown his sister when
the obelisk doing </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">her</font></em>
<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">bidding is
what killed him? Heck no. Bracing, he dove in.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That left
Thwomp #3, of which there was no such in Bowser&rsquo;s army since
five years ago when the real one passed away. Bowser Castle was a
logistical mess before a storm made it a literal one and the identity
withstood scrutiny until crossing old student J.D. He should have
terminated his espionage then, but how could he when it became
interesting for once. Now he was this close to contributing to the
rescue of his princess? He hopped right in.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Move
along partner. (I totally see through you..),&rdquo; Jr. Troopa
admonished the sentry he caught in perseveration.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sentry 11
blinked back, the fingers he was counting still held up. The lakitu
cleared his throat. He could hear Richard Sr. in the kitchen chopping
rapidly something meaty with knives. Indeed he did not need his
identity revealed right now.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He dragged
Troopa over. &ldquo;Kid, listen. I know where &lsquo;You-know-who&rsquo;
is now. I&rsquo;d tallied him before (Wendy) put &lsquo;two&rsquo;
people (the princess, Toadsworth) in the toad house. I just didn&rsquo;t
recognize his face cause he wasn&rsquo;t talking and was moping in a
way I&rsquo;d never seen before!&rdquo;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Flamed
torches walled off the Koopa family from the troop as the ceremony
began. A blue magikoopa, not Kamek, but one that shared freshman
class with him, approached with a large golden crown, a basic design,
not too heavy, only adorned with red rhinestones, on a pillow of
nesting material. Wendy O. sat, legs crossed on a throne of a cut
tree log, situated below the Toad House with the four others. Roy,
Morton, Junior, and presumably Iggy, held their breath as the
magikoopa presented the crown. Wendy slowly held it, watching her
reflection in the polished gold, tracing a gem with a claw. It was
pristine despite originating from many dynasties back, attractive
without being overabundant, but not really </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">special</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Stop!!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She gasped
at the defector, a green plumber in the sea of seated minions. Roy
barged ahead, through the torches, and got all in his face, towering
over him.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
do you care bout our business chump? Dere ain&rsquo;t no Bowser for
y&rsquo;all to fight!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
nudged him back. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do. Return our princess and
Toadsworth!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Roy
slapped him to the ground and sneered. &ldquo;Look at this green
loser, all &lsquo;lone thinkin&rsquo; he&rsquo;s bout ta stop us! Ha
ha ha!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Only
Morton joined in. Bowser Junior kept his mouth shut, knees folded,
Iggy statically did what he&rsquo;d always done, nothing, and Wendy
gawked. Roy followed her line of sight to the additional person
giggling, Luigi.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Didn&rsquo;t
any of you learn?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Behind him
Roy noticed that his minions, suspiciously quiet, sipping and gulping
down ice cold cans of soda, barely paying attention to proceedings
anymore. An unusually colored thwomp was near an empty pallet.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
the?!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Give
your lackeys a break. Fleeing a kingdom and staying outside all day
would make anyone thirsty!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Roy lifted
Luigi and half crushed him, shouting &ldquo;You are dead!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And..
you.. are.. distracted! Per.. your. surveyor.. minion,&rdquo; Luigi
explained, holding his grin despite the discomfort, &ldquo;You..
have.. a.. secret. captive.. you..might.. Not.. know.. about.. in.
that.. Toad House.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Roy and
his siblings whipped to the startling sight of Mario and Sentry 11
prying the boards that had been nailed on it. At the same time, some
rogue swiped the crown from Wendy, Larry. He scuttled with it under
his arm to the house and high jump kicked, the final blow that broke
it in.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Discard
thy sweetened elixirs and taketh these blithering fools!&rdquo; Wendy
howled, shooting to her feet. &ldquo;Cast them into the abyss!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Reluctantly
straying from their chilled Morel Moxies, koopas and dry bones
charged in formation to apprehend the plumber ensemble. From a jungle
vine, Jr. Troopa swooped in, bowling over many and knocking Morton
away. His body bounced down hill. Junior ducked from the tree stomp
Roy threw. Jr. Troopa&rsquo;s training all day kicking in, chopped it
out of the sky and then squared Roy in the jaw, freeing Luigi. It was
a knockout and in perfect view of the one stepping out the defunct
item home.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The red
crust filled eyes, scanned over the scene, his pesky plumber enemies,
the conspicuous crowning ceremony, awestruck minions, dumbfounded
children, and Larry holding the crown before him. His pallid second
youngest son looked from the crowd to his father, one tear streaming
down.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
knew you were still around, dad..&rdquo; He lifted it to Bowser, the
only sounds to them the sizzle of carbonated cans in the distance.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Speechless,
Bowser accepted and foreginly wore it for once on his lumpy head, the
unevenness of his unkempt hair crooking the placement. None the less
he was King again and that was that.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Or not!</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">WAIT
A MINUTE!&rdquo; He exploded, stomping the ground. All the torches
fell over and birds scattered from trees all around. &ldquo;What did
I just walk into??? A sham ceremony??? What the heck are you all
doing??! I avoided everybody because I wanted time to think and
somebody shuffled me in there for some reason then it got boarded up
and then.. I don&rsquo;t remember- but now you replace me and let
Luigi and Mario foil a plan for world domination I haven't even made
yet?!?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There was
an earsplitting eruption of pleas from his subjects.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">SHUT
UP!!!! This is what&rsquo;s up. Thanks to that time out I am a deep
meditative Koop King in touch with erm.. The thingies. Where&rsquo;s
gramps and old hag? .. Huh?!? Gone???? No way idiots. I feel an
overwhelming aura of crotchetiness and moldy cheese in my soul. Yeah
they are alive and will beat you all with a switch for drinking
caffeine drinks this late AND for replacing me so soon!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The Koopa
Troop shrieked in horror, running off and hiding into the trees or
underground to avoid the wrath of their elders. Wendy screamed in
place, eye flashing. Bowser ignoring that, only finding it strange
that her tantrum wasn&rsquo;t making it spontaneously rain like it
always did.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
confidently strolled past the shocked stupid faces of his kids. &ldquo;Is
Peach and Toadsworth in there?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And
moooooore!!!&rdquo; Invisible against the sky, a cape wearer landed
clumsily on the roof of the home with a detector flashing and
blaring.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad?!
You.. how did you get here? What is that?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
peeled his face off the mushroom tiles and slid off to the ground.
Luigi caught him, perplexed and immensely relieved the same to see
him again.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He turned
over. &quot;Thanks.. Haha&hellip;Was I late to the epic thing you
did? Darn. I fell for like, hours.. Captain Toad held me up. I took
this treasure detector thing to find you all and I was given back in
Sky Land a neat tele...&quot; He reached in his back pocket, eyes
widening at what wasn't there.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Telescope?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Nothing.
Just.. I can stand. Go do your thing,&quot; Toad urged him off.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser off
to the side rolled his eyes. &ldquo;Ignore these extra characters.
Yeah Peach and her old man is in there yadda yadda. Do your hero
thing already..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Back to
business, Luigi prodded him back to the Toad House with Mario in the
rear, making sure no one counter attacked. They entered the dark cold
clay building, emptied, with and upstairs. After flashing a signal,
Luigi darted for that while Mario remained with Bowser on the smaller
cramped lower floor. His nemesis aware of how this post-battle
interrogation went, he reversed until his spikes hit the stairwell
wall. He was in view of the window and in the moonlight, and a lot of
scarring popped out at Mario. There was also in there a blue statue
that detector must of been beeping at. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
did a bad thing.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well
duh.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Why?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">To
fight you!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
shrugged. &ldquo;So what&rsquo;s so different about this millionth
time I&rsquo;ve been defeated?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Because
Bowser this time...&rdquo; Mario steadied, channeling disappointment
and anger, along with solace that he was alive, the perceptivity that
he could not judge him without accounting for his role, into an
action.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lost in
the embrace that followed, something was new about it this time.
Bowser wasn&rsquo;t sure what it was except that it made him do this.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Alright,
I&rsquo;m sorry for this stuff I guess!&rdquo; he blurted out. &ldquo;I
mean, I took her, yeah then other crap started going wrong. Something
was in my system and I thought a good fight would bring it out. It
didn&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
separated only a little in their embrace. &ldquo;Bowser, this is
where I was getting at. It&rsquo;s different because.. Would you
retire with me?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
appeared to let that sink in. &ldquo;And &hellip;Just play tennis all
day??&rdquo; He released the plumber to fold his arms and stare off
grouch like. &ldquo;My EVERYTHING is awry in case ya can&rsquo;t see.
I&rsquo;ve lost my home and most of my troops. Two of my sons haven&rsquo;t
returned from outta town. One of my sons looks like a hologram. My
daughter just took being a brat too far! And my gramps is flat out
missing, along with my ugly hag in-law and my clown car keys!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-I
get that angle. Really. I had to start from scratch too once, you
know. After you get situated and we cure people of Mushroom Flu- You
still aren't getting out of that!&rdquo; Mario punched him lightly,
then eased up. &ldquo;I understand just by hanging with Peach that
there&rsquo;s a lot involved in delegating, but if you&rsquo;re
willing to consider it then I&rsquo;ll help you.&rdquo; He reached
for his claw and squeezed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
faced him tentatively. &ldquo;Stop. W-we can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Fine.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Cause
I gotta do this!&rdquo; He lunged at the red plumber, forcing him to
flip backwards across the doorway and against the opposite wall, in
the perfect spot for Bowser to snatch him and lift him upward, his
feet dangling.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser!
Come on!&rdquo; Mario fussed, punching and kicking the air.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
thought you loved it like this?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
stopped struggling.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">In spite
of that build up, the shallow breaths of both, the inferno inside,
all he could go for was a quick- strictly platonic!!! (he kept
relaying in his head) -Peck on those chubby cheeks.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">.&hellip;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">This toad
home was deceptively large, wider at the stop and with far too many
steps to tackle at night-</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi,
is that you?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
princess&rsquo;s voice was so&hellip;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Are
you two okay??&rdquo; he panted.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
am.. In one part, yes.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He felt
his heart thump in his chest as he bent down to her curled in the
corner with Toadsworth. She reached out and felt around until her
gloveless hand rested on Luigi&rsquo;s forearm.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach,
are you okay?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Some fresh
moonlight caught her visage, shining through a bang in her stringy
blonde hair. Luigi breathed out &lsquo;Oh God..&rsquo;</font></p>

wanted to melt and he wasn't sure if it was in a good way or not,
separating a swift half step before being caught by both arms.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;What
Mario?&quot; he sputtered. &quot;I- I just wanted- to try- uh,
somethin' new!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Alright
alright, calm down!&quot; the plumber laughed gently, not letting go
yet. &quot;Bowser... I don't think I've ever seen you in your crown
before. Not a crown. That one.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Really?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;So
last chance. Yes or no?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
stared back, flushed, cogs in his head visibly turning. (Just do it
stupid. For the past six years you've had a plan going. An ethical,
crowd pleasing- well 'cept for this part, way out.) &quot;I-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-CAREFUL!
Hold me, both of you!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Didn't
do it!&quot; Mario's release let Bowser shoot his arms up.
&quot;Whatever's going on! I swear!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
carefully came down, stabilizing both Toadsworth and Peach. Mario
dashed over to help and, temporarily forgotten in the corner, Bowser
was relieved to get out of that. Pressure might have made diamonds.
He could see it in them, in how in a matter a few moments playing out
in front of him, they roped Fungus Face in there and he got a whole
train to come up the mountain. For him though, he kept crumbling into
dust. He didn't have a decision yet.</font></p>

are vanquished from the territories except one by the merits of their
innate evasive abilities. Some revel in how they affright the toads,
others wish only to lord undisturbed over the plots they've
rightfully owned for generations. Their love of accumulating trinkets
draws a crowd to the amphitheater where treasure is tucked amongst
the catacombs. After the fourth visit, deep down, too far to teleport

</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
reporter snagged the fire ax of the establishment and rolled on to
his destination alone. He surveyed castle grounds from across the
glassy lake, the reflection it should have of Peach's Castle missing.
He followed the river towards Star Hill until he found a spot where
castle grounds intercepted the chasm. Evaporating the last bit of
doubt in him, he tugged off his shiny left dress shoe, chopping the
exposed pinky toe to the bone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With a
sacrifice for the fissure of the obelisk, he chucked it down before
he bled too much. Psychically imprinted on, the appendage that was
dead while attached told him everything about what was on the other
side of the abyss, as immediate as a lightning bolt. He smiled. What
else he needed then was buried, or submerged rather a mile down.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Covering
in moss and twigs, a towel wrapped around one foot, he gestured to

for him.</font></p>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dusk hours
made the blinking lights obvious to sheepish observers, realizing
with a slap to the grizzled face that there wasn't supposed to be a
second water tower near Mt. Rugged. One rancher was even zapped by
the entity's defense system after wandering too close. A party was
organized to sniff it out. Dr. Topper in the back of the candlelit
town square meeting rushed to the lab with renewed zeal. It matched
the description of the spaceship of none other than Prof. Morris
X-Naut. If they outpaced the Southerners and used it to beam the
professor in from his unknown location in Toad Town, problem solved,
except&hellip; Dr. Toad was </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">still</font></em>
<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">in his

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
flattened down his tie-dye jacket, resisting making a scene. The sand
in the hourglass on the table drained steadily, like their time
before Mr. X would expect results. &quot;Hi. Why don't you slip on
your shoes?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Startled,
Dr. Toad dropped some pastels. &quot;It's more comfortable without
them,&quot; the toad doctor replied, composed again.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The hammer
brother pursed his lips. &quot;Drew, we've found Prof. X-Naut's ship,

down...&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad

would never drop his shields. No matter. I must tell Maverick and
Sigmund.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Topper
tried to bend around the tall toad and squint at the messages through
the narrow angles on the LCD. Besides it's purpose of accessing their
other facility via a terminal, it was said to host the best puzzle

they shouldn't have stuck to online conferencing... Fine. I'll go.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Why?..&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He jabbed
the 'send' button. &quot;...Because doctor.. my diary is in there.
Yes, mine. No one else's. And.. there's stickers on the cover, see,
and... like I said, I'll do it. You can use the computer in the
meantime.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The K64
was overshadowed by high speed rail services like the Toad Town 10X
line, or different styles altogether, but beloved still for its rich
history, dedicated staff, and rails that weaved around some of the
most inhospitable of terrain.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;It's
only brain fever. I will sleep it off.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadsworth
remained where he was. &quot;Where, my dear? That hotel is..&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No
no. It'll work out,&quot; she trailed, curled up in the rear of the
car.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad got
the hint by then to leave her be. Something one would never know with
the polished Lakitu Bros chronicling of their lives, the princess
always had a 'calling' of home, the most traumatic of these
adventures when Toad Town was utterly destroyed. He sure hoped not.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No,
crossing by Jr. Troopa, able to operate a phone despite being folded
into a paper swan by koopalings, it couldn't have went down like that
back home. He'd told them. Sure there was untamed wilderness outside,
but everyone under the age of twenty-five could find a signal if they
wanted to. Mario meanwhile, twiddled thumbs. With that tarp covered
object taking up the spot next to him, Toad couldn't dip over quickly
and ask what any of that was about. That left Luigi in the front,
alerted when Toad slid next to him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Everything
settling, that was what he planned all along. Still, he'd better be
discreet. He adjusted Kinopio-Kun's iPhone on the lowest backlight
setting and used the notes app..</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">'I'm
worried about Sam, he don't look good, and especially our girl.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He texted
back. 'That didn't escape me either. Toadsworth was cold! What's
next?'</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">'First
thing tomorrow we- (magnifying glass emoji) on those two. ...Also I
buy you a- (cake emoji). You saved the day! (streamer emoji)'</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
stifled a laugh. When Mario glanced over, the green plumber self
consciously ducked some, replying, 'Look, WE saved the day. It really
captured the zeitgeist of how it used to be. You know, us not knowing
what we were doing.' He chuckled openly then. 'Even 'I'm so retired'
Mario helped do whatever the heck he did so that Bowser never tried
anything. My only regret is not getting back to Boo today.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">'Srs?
Sorry man... Hey, do you have pics from that tennis game?'</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;What?&quot;
Luigi grabbed the phone. 'I mean, what? I'll tell you. You had a
whopping two-hundred volleys in one set! You didn't starch your vest,
you've lost ten pounds without telling me, one shoe was untied, and
your fly was not quite open, but dangerously getting there. I yelled
from the stands to no avail, lol.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">'Everyone
else?'</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">'I can't
remember off hand.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">'You
really are over Daisy, aren't you?'</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
blinked. 'That blunt? Sure. We're photogenic together and my fan club
really (he hunted for the bold button) <b>REALLY</b> wanted us to be
a thing, but our love languages weren't the same, and we had that
omnipresent issue, that more of us have than we want to admit, of
needing Mario to coalesces. If nothing extravagant was happening, we
weren't if you get me. Was I the problem? Probably.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad kept
fixed on their chatter forming one big paragraph on the display, the
legal pad skeuomorphism of the application bathing him in yellow.
Luigi steeled himself for some derision. He just undercut his own
success, his ability to sustain a relationship, everything short of
admitting that he liked some Brittney Spearguy tracks. (Some. Like
the 90s ones)</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
cleared a lot of it out, his reply interrupted by a huge bump.
Actually it felt like they hit a brick wall. Everyone in the train
was launched against roof, landing again on hard surfaces as amber
sparks flew outside. As soon as it happened, it was over, the
engineer peeking into the disarrayed cabin, apologizing over the
excessive speed at a switch.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dizzily,
Luigi grabbed onto a coat rack to crawled onto the seat again. &quot;Ugh.
What?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
was gonna say..&quot; Toad went blank, maybe from being banged up, or
maybe.. &quot;You're.. kind, articulate, empathic, clever, and
low-key braver than your brother because you've gotten you where you
are with a fraction of the support. It wasn't you, Luigi.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Huh?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad bit
his tongue. &quot;Or Daze. She's cool too, ha ha.&quot; He reached
over and flipped up the shutters. The stars were shining on him. &quot;Oh,
and look at that. We're almost back!&quot;<br/>
Everyone, including
Jr. Troopa, jumbled back into being crumpled but Koopa shaped erupted
in applause. There was a shimmering sea out there while they skipped
from rickety, just functional bridged islands. When Toad noticed some
paratoopas working under utility lights, erecting a billboard for
Wendy O. for mayor, he retracted that earlier thought, breaking into
a even colder sweat.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Bowser's
daughter..&quot; Toadsworth shook his head ruefully. &quot;Of course,
extend that stronghold will you?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Neo
Bowser City is still independent. I'm a candidate too.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He whipped
Toad's way, making him shrink. &quot;Preposterous!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Besides
reunification, I know about all of their problems, the demographics,
and the area codes by heart from you sending me there all the time,
Sam! What if instead of commerce, I actually help them?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
stood slowly. &quot;Toad's a famous face, has never been in a
scandal, and knows Darklandian, a good ice-breaker to those folks.
Let him cook.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;See
you get it. I was wondering if.. you'd be my deputy?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
rayed. &quot;Absolutely.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach shot
up. &quot;I... Could we discuss this later?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Then Mario
leaned over his seat. &quot;Peach, this doesn't sully you at all.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;That's
not what I-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Toad
I'll vote for you.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Me
too, partner!&quot; Troopa chipped in. &quot;I'll tell my workers
too.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Me
three!&quot; was the muffled shout of the conductor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
princess massaged her temples, her and Toadsworth giving up
seemingly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Cool,
so we survived that- somehow, homeboy. Thanks, we'll talk about it,&quot;
Toad shook Luigi's hand, which they mutually pulled into a hug. The
toad used volume control as they finally seated, whispering. &quot;And
I was thinking, like.. Over dinner sometime? I mean, if you want..&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi felt
the pressure increase slightly in the clasp of the hand shake they
were still holding, forgetting to breathe as they locked eyes. &quot;Ah...
You mean?-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;A- a
date, yeah. Or going somewhere if you want to think about it that
way,&quot; Toad continued, low and just a bit shakily.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Where
is this coming from?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Truthfully,
&quot;From way back and from just now at the same time.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
plumber leaned back into the wooden seats, blushing. &quot;Why not?
Just- nothing extravagant.&quot;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Can
we go, Kinopiko?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yes,
sorry.&quot; The pink toad closed a bookmarked page, the lime green
toad leaving her behind. At least the 'let's stop and rest' and by
'rest' she meant 'I want to study' worked three times consecutively.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kinopio-Kun
might have had to use a walker, cocooned in heavy blankets when they
all knew by then of his Yakuza tattoos, but she had breaking her neck
and shoulders Peach's parcel, why she struggled to catch up on the
country roads. If not for its resemblance of a purse, she'd not be
asked to carry it as the female identifying castle toad. Oh wait, she
specifically begged for the honor. Still though-</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hey
Kinopiko, I know you aren't on borrowed time like me, but you know
this area more than me. Do keep up.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Boos
have terrified people with hallucinations for centuries. I wish you'd
stop saying that.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I'm
running from kodokushi. That was a vision then. It'll be a reality if
I don't resign tonight.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Excuse
me. What is?-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Don't
worry about it.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ala-Gold
would have known, she thought. Always with access to the imports from
King Omarinon's domain. Also why Kinopio showed up with the 'bishie
sparkles' and all, he was totally immune.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">As they
were dressed relatively like cityfolk and toting items, bags, etc,
they appeared like nocturnal salesmen or evangelists when strolling
down someone's driveway by mistake, it indistinguishable from forks
in the road. Awkward times.. Eventually they were out of residential
area, where the stars twinkled in the deep blue sky and insects
chirped from high bean farms, the stalks waving frequently in the
wind.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
soured as they crossed a pillory belonging to the local jail at the
side of the road, wooden individual cells side by side. Imprisoned
Paper Macho Outlaws clamored at the bars.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Psst.
You over there. Help us out,&quot; croaked someone in the last cell.
&quot;We don't belong here!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
flashed a light upwards at two short snouts sticking out the bars.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Like
we're going to fall for this..&quot; Kinopio said down low. &quot;Who
are ya anyway?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Mr.
and Mrs. Hotstuff,&quot; answered a different screechy and softer
voice.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Both toads
rolled their eyes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No,
it's true! We were minding our business in our jacuzzi then- wham!
We're in this smelly old vehicle of some health inspector weirdos.
They locked us up because we're koopas! We're sweet 'n innocent!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hmph,
mostly..&quot; groused the other inmate.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Got
somethin' reflective? Couldja just, erm, write our names in it?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
gestured to silently walk away. Kinopio in pity slipped them a
business card for a good attorney. Toadette found that unexpectedly
thoughtful and was inspired to spare a little mirror anyway, whatever
it was wanted for. She'd not miss the cheap thing. They continued on
until a bright flash casted their shadow as far as Vick's barn a
quarter mile off. They spun to find two wrinkly magikoopas outside
the cell, one in dark blue trunks, the other a purple one piece, the
mirror at their feet and shattered from behind tossed out by them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Kamek!
Kammy!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Hotstuff,
toady brat!&quot; Kamek sneered. &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Hotstuff to you!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;We
used the internet to legally change it so we could fool some
schmuck!&quot; Kammy 'Hotstuff' revealed a senior oriented phone with
oversized buttons.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
had a..&quot; she trailed, gawking. &quot;Excuse me, but why not just
call someone for help?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
magikoopas shrugged at each other. &quot;Maybe our folks were in
mountains or something. Sayonara!&quot; They whisked off in the
country.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Ugh!
Just what we needed.&quot; Gritting her teeth, Toadette tugged
Kinopio along, chasing the baddies to a western styled theater.
Spotlights lit up the advert for the traveling Paper Macho Friends
Troupe. Jazzy music bled out the open swing doors and ostros of those
inside were tied to stakes. Someone blocked the toads.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Sold
out,&quot; informed the noki nurse they seen around, name tag bearing
the odd name 'Laki Bond'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kinopio
whipped out a platinum VIP pass. Laki adjusted his glasses, quickly
shifting out of the way for them. Indoors the lobby was devoid of
anyone, the snack booth was closed, and one person was in the timed
coin operated massage chairs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She tapped
Kamek, crusty feet up leisurely. &quot;I am so reporting you!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Why?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;...Uh&hellip;
You have no shirt or shoes! &hellip;And you used a wooden coin for
the machine. I literally see the string attached to it in your hand!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Go
on Karen, ee hee hee!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Determined
Toadette stepped away, spotting someone ostensibly of authority
entering the auditorium. She tracked the country toad girl down in
the isle.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Howdy!&quot;
Rou T. as the nametag stated squeezed the mess out of Toadette,
pulling her with her. &quot;Sorry Luci T., didn't think you'd wander
down. I see a spot!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Some Birdo
lookalike lip synced before dancing cowboys as Toadette found herself
stuffed in a front row seat with the nurse. She glanced to her left.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
adore this show!&quot; Kammy squeed. &quot;....What is it called
gain?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Then the
lead singer pointed Toadette out. &quot;You there, darling! Come on
up!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
intonation, drawl, all inaccurate to the real pink dinosaur. Toadette
would know, Birdo being one of the few non fungi she cared to study.
With infatuation and a teaching opportunity both reeling her in, she
was up and on that stage in a jiffy!</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Losing
sight of Toadette, Kinopio backed outside again, panged with
enervation. His island dwelling instincts resurged, taking note of
the bright spotlights. He carefully dropped without bending his back
and swiveled one towards the clouds, jiggling the plug to power
switch it in a pattern. He then offered the noki approaching a wad of
cash.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
will not accept a bribe to ignore you,&quot; Laki replied sternly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The toad
let the bills drop, like they were worthless. &quot;That's to not
ignore me. Get me home.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Sir?
I-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
know you can. You have spies in your family. Two of them. Actually
three, unless they finally got that divorce.&quot;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
did the King say? Over.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Koopalings
spotted outside palace. Earthquake ruined the construction zone for
daughter&rsquo;s castle. Hoooold it, I&rsquo;m doing the
interrogation here!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She gave a
snort, with the hand off the receiver button.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The senior
guard continued, &ldquo;-You&rsquo;ve been absent for hours! We&rsquo;ve
set camp at so and so coordinates. It&rsquo;s southward and not on
any maps for some reason, eh. Very flat and fugitive Boo Elenor
Diddley hasn&rsquo;t been seen. I suggest you and Jonathan get here
for discipline. Over.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sure.
Over.&rdquo; She clicked. &ldquo;&hellip;My dead body.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The toad
guard dinked around in protest, plucking away at the guitar, hooked
through an effects pedal and into the speaker of her radio via an
adapter she found at a Radioshack, creating an awful screech that fit
right in with her audience of cicadas in the bushes and shrubs of
Toad Town park. A few coins were in her pocket from manning landlines
for Kylie Koopa, phone bombing MK East, leading to the &lsquo;scoop&rsquo;
that former nurse Nass T. might be in town. Now that chapter was
over, and Bridget wasn&rsquo;t too invested in the ramifications of
that.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The guard
half tiredly fixated on the metallic green Boss Waza-Craft BS-3
&lsquo;Blame-Shifter&rsquo; modulation pedal in the grass. It was
from the pink boo Trevor, her boyfriend maybe.. He&rsquo;d truthfully
told her to not activate it until Festive Tree day after she found
the present early during the first and only time she&rsquo;d been
inside his home. No telling what he&rsquo;d think considering she
snuck it out with her and held on to it until now, when at last she
had the guitar to accompany it. She stomped on it. The &lsquo;Check&rsquo;
light came on. The knob was on the &lsquo;bassist&rsquo; mode.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Far far
away, Lemmy Koopa was smacked with depression. &ldquo;I feel like
everything is my fault, the thing with Iggy, you, and Wendy. I
remember it as well as yesterday evening.. Because most of it was.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig, in
the backseat of the intergalactic holographic Biddybuggy, swept him
closer. &ldquo;Fret not. Look at this mission of what we need to
gather..&ldquo; He unfolded an ancient scroll, from Geno.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Eggs,
a figurine, and an engagement ring?-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The blue
haired koopaling flipped the shopping list around and bashfully
tucked that way. Before he retrieved the real thing, Snifit Patrol in
the front passenger spot pointed to something twinkling on the
approaching home planet.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
distress signal!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Officer,
we are occupied enough with a treasure hunt!&rdquo; Ludwig said.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No,
let's help Sumeet, Luddy,&rdquo; Lemmy squeaked. &ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;ll
feel better..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Groaning,
the blue haired koopaling let them take the detour.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bridget
got bored with that and spun the knob counterclockwise to the &lsquo;vox&rsquo;
mode.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Birdo shut
tight her blinds to darken the motel somewhat. In Subcon it was
morning and her sleep schedule was already wrecked from traveling the
entire way straight. Her luggage was dropped next to the fluffy cloud
couch she flopped down on. Yoshi&rsquo;s revelations were stinging
but dead-on. Anxiously sitting on the side of the bed when he was on
adventure, the frequent arguments, it all drained her soul. Distanced
from that and the modeling, she&rsquo;d be motivated to take on her
greatest pleasure again, stage performing with her campy theater
crew. Something she&rsquo;d packed was calling to her- or delirium
from guzzled tea was settling in.. She unzipped the hot pink
suitcase. A golden phanto mask was on top of clothes, that other
modeling prop aside from the Bronze Egg.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
relaxed again and made a call to Yoshi. It failed to even ring. He
must be on airplane mode. She shook her head, gaily. No that can&rsquo;t
be it. He was terrified of flying! She wanted it gone like the
abhorrent egg. Who could she call? She tried a fellow influencer..</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Hello,
Kinopio-Kun darling. It&rsquo;s Birdo. I can&rsquo;t reach Yoshi, so
would you like me to mail this artifact over? I used to collect and
I&rsquo;m out of that game. I know you work with brokers.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">....Uh
-Hey! This is Mr. Toad, his boss.&rdquo; He covered over the speaker
and turned to Luigi, looking back expectantly. &ldquo;We have a
museum so send it. By the way have you heard of- Hello?....&rdquo; </font>
</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">As a last
ditch effort to see some effect, Bridget turned to the center &lsquo;self&rsquo;
mode, instantly getting thwomped with despair.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He slung
her gear into the hard case, sat for a moment and then screamed. A
cog in their machine she was no more. She ripped off her black combat
helmet. It bounced into the sandpit and her auburn hair was released.
She crushed the radio with her boots. She unsnapped the armor. Freed
from that heavy gear, she felt weightless. All she needed was to fly
in her B-Dasher. -Which was revving up on the park's curb, headlights
on.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jon!&rdquo;
she howled, sprinting through the park. She flipped off the top of
the jungle gym, spun in the air acrobatically and caught the kart by
the bumper.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Then it
sped off.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Her head
banged, completely unlike during a concert like she&rsquo;d dreamed,
against the metal chrome parts as she was dragged around, noxious
gasses from the exhaust choking her. A sharp curve flung her off into
the middle of the road, where another kart swerved around her.
Lifting up painfully, a few bikes went by and pedestrians were on the
street. Without commotion in the city, Mushroomites made up for
missed business very late or stayed out to see the princess return.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
gleaned that rather accurately from the loudmouth on the sidewalk, in
front of the HotFoot Locker.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Good
take?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah.&rdquo;
The other Lakitu brother lowered the camera. They had Mushroom Press
patches.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Now
we're gonna cover that abandoned tank around the block?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His cloud
riding brother nodded, then spun around rapidly as Bridget pushed by.
She found the unattended tank, not preferable and sluggish, moreso
with the Kettle thing strapped to it, the reason she enrolled in the
bring your own vehicle program. She took it anyway, pinching her nose
for the inevitable stank of the interior and made off again. With
knowledge of the city from earlier joy riding, she took a shortcut
through the garden leading to Flower Fields, cut through the pipes to
the tunnels, and intercepted the B-Dasher as it crossed the Shy Guy&rsquo;s
Toy Box amusement park portal.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Stop!!
I need your teapot or I&rsquo;ll become almost unbearable to deal
with!&rdquo; Some crazy guy leapt in front of the tank and wrapped
himself around the gun.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
slammed open the hatch, fuming. &ldquo;The kettle??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The small
alien slid off. A mildly portly shorter grey skinned humanoid, he had
a grubby white doctor's coat, a tin foil hat and thick goggles.
Outside the unmarked eastern building was his ratty medical bag.
Scratches on the door told her he&rsquo;d been lockpicking and
succeeded, as light bled through the sides of the entrance.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-However
you northerners refer to it. You would not want to venture too far up
north anyway, with those psy waves abound. Ah hem. I am Prof. X-Naut,
#1 scientist and secret organization target. Since you are not a
proponent of the powers that be, Ms. Bridget Jane Toad, considering
you reside in Poshley Heights, room 74 at the Inn, I thought you
might be inclined to assist.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Baffled,
she staggered back against the armored vehicle. &ldquo;Hey, dude.
Just.. take it!&rdquo; She released the elastic bands. The one ton
cooking ware slid down the sloped tank edge and flattened him before
she could intervene. &ldquo;Crap.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
no, half capacity is sufficient to nuke the diabolical hideout the
most dangerous covert organization in Toad Town.&rdquo; Prof. X-Naut
chortled, effortlessly slipping right out from underneath. The paper
character flipped upwards, unharmed except a small crease on his top
corner. &ldquo;If SS HQ is not remediated, the documents regarding
Mushroom Flu will be compromised, a fate worser than you can imagine.
I am grateful for your cooperation. You may carry my MacGuffin for
now. It catches Red Chomps in Neon Heights after a player has landed
on the happening space, wearing a Close Call badge. I&rsquo;m Feeling
Fine. No, I did not have an anachronism..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He shoved
a brown leather messenger bag at her, so lightweight it wanted to
lift out of her hands on its own and with a strong hoydenish aroma
she enjoyed more than she should in that brief whiff.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Haha,
you mean aneurysm?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No,
I mean a stroke.&rdquo; The odd little man revealed a golf club and
left her dumbfounded, all the way until she encountered her baby, her
B-Dasher in a wreck a block down.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It was
lodged between concrete poles designed to prevent an outlet from some
E-rated gambling district. The Game Guy alley was a mini Mario Party
board with less than twenty functional spaces and props of a carnival
lining the sides for atmosphere. She winched, zoning in on the
scratched paint. Enraged, she yanked the other guard out of the seat
by the ear, standing over him as he splat flat on the pavement.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Explain.
Com'on. Right now!!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His eyes
fluttered open. &ldquo;Ben called for me. He&rsquo;s out of the
water.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She leaned
up, scowl fading. Jon had to be delusional. The squad wouldn&rsquo;t
keep Benedict&rsquo;s body rotting in Peach's lake, would they?</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Much
excitement and uncertainty alike pooled in the toads waiting under
the canopy of the Mt. Rugged rail station. The usual procedure during
a kidnap was to stick to the castle- an impossibility. Would Princess
Peach be disturbed by how desultory they were and the hijinks that
ensnared them due to that? What about that they&rsquo;d accepted a
new steward from Dark Land that she never met? What of losing
Ala-Gold Wolley Toad following Zoo&rsquo;s attack? A blue toad scaled
down to make a call across the globe. At Ricco Harbor it would be
about sunrise now. He just wanted to talk to someone. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Not them
though. Some rowdy looking shy guys and koopas with red scarves
wrapped around their faces wrestled with their ostros next to the
payphone stall, their steeds spooked wavy northern lights, casting
over crops and fields with a rouge glow. The blue toad dodged behind
a large rock and peered at a clump of lights on the horizon, the city
where it wasn&rsquo;t originating from. Something zipped across his
vision, escaping the gang&rsquo;s clutches.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
impulsively pursued the Mecha-Yoshi rider down into a moo moo pasture
where the robot valleyed in a dip in the ground. The rider hopped off
and pensively examined an open panel on the mecha&rsquo;s neck.
Bucken-Berry tip toed. The stooped low farm animals had him recall an
old sailors superstition from Ala-Gold. That meant a storm was
a-brewin&rsquo; brah. ..But there weren&rsquo;t cows in the ocean and
it was just as likely they were sleepy since it was midnight to the
dot. Bucken-Berry could read the familiar looking analog watch on the
red toad&rsquo;s right wrist- that&rsquo;s how close he was.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey.
Dude.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The other
guy juggled his pda in surprise, just catching it. &ldquo;I
apologize. I struggle with this skittishness when..&rdquo; he
trailed, a spark in his eyes.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wait..
are you-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bucken-Berry
was cut off by a charging debull. Instinctively, he pulled the other
toad away as the beast plowed through the Mecha, mechanical parts
scattering on the farm. All the moo moos were roused into a stampede.
Bucken-Berry snatched the other guy up by his collar and leapt
upwards, bouncing from each one until lobbed over the perimeter
together, where a big googie styled city limits billboard cast light
on them with its mix of working and blown out lightbulbs. Painted
purple, it stated &lsquo;Area 64 Starts Here&rsquo;. A little ways
down was an army camp with a fire, tents, parked Dry-Bomber tanks.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bucken-Berry&rsquo;s
heart skipped a beat. Not hunched over some screen with a white coat
on, that red toad was even taller and more lively with his blond wavy
medium length hair down. His revealed undershirt was tailored short
sleeved button up, a sky blue with a shine sprite pattern printed on.
Striking black tribal tattoos wrapped around both arms. Another layer
of intrigue regarding Zoo&rsquo;s..freakin&hellip;brother.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
freaking knew it,&rdquo; the blue toad hissed. &ldquo;What even put
you out here??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">My
myopic ways. Anyway, thank you Bucken-Berry,&rdquo; he replied,
suppressing inflection. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m intact to handle
something long overdue-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hold
on!&rdquo; The blue toad caught up. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Drew L.
Diddley, artist of.. Whatever this word means. Take the thing.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
had a flicker of something and then slipped &rsquo;Assemblation&rsquo;
into his back jeans pockets. &ldquo;That classic.. I supposed the
signature on the back uncovered some oddities. That I am of half toad
and boo lineage and that Zoo Diddley, yes my younger psychotic
sibling, owned it. I will explain it all some other time if we&hellip;
exchange numbers,&rdquo; he beamed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Not
thinking, Bucken-Berry agreed. He glanced from the digits on the slip
of paper and back up- the doctor had teleported almost a third of the
way up the ladder of this bulb shaped water tower, shimmering silver
in the moonlight. Bucken-Berry dashed to the barbed fence around it.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">HEY!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Maintain
your distance!&rdquo; Dr. Toad advised, still sounding pleased with
himself and continuing to climb.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah,
right, the blue toad spat. He&rsquo;d just jump that tiny gate thing.
Backing up for a running start, he trampled on something hidden in
tumbleweeds. He kicked some dislodged battery pack.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thanks,
could we please have that, Blue Toad?&rdquo; The polite inquirer had
a sweet little voice, Darklandian accented.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He brushed
against Lemmy Koopa, stature stretched out a lot, glowing like the
environment.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Eek
a.. I mean.. Koopa freak. Your scheme failed bro! Piss off!!!!&rdquo;
he shook a fist.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Shrieking,
Lemmy retreated behind Iggy, on his knees twisting a screwdriver at a
heap of something that had crash landed. Ludwig was tapping a foot,
busy with scrolls, and they all had a glow matching the astral
phenomena. Before he got to walloping, a fourth person was revealed
when a stubby arm rose from a dented up water trough. They reached
over, and a snufit exhaustively spilled out of it, panting.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">State..the..
Emergency. Snifit Patrol&hellip; at.. Your.. service..
Citizen..Oof..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bucken-Berry
marched to the officer. &ldquo;What the heck is going on?!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy Delta
rose. &ldquo;My Transporter-To-Convenient-Plotpoint-Location DLC
downloaded!&rdquo; he triumphantly announced. &ldquo;Except I
prematurely blasted this area with intense gamma rays when there was
no distress signal, only a blinking theater spotlight. And it was to
the wrong plot point.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy did
a twirling gesture at his ear.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Reserve
that for me, Lemmy, for your shell is green and Ignatius orange, you
six feet two, Ignatius four in a half, among other discrepancies in
your physical appearances!&rdquo; Ludwig commented.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Aaahhh!...Oh
my God, our bodies are swapped! Or our heads. Or something!&rdquo;
Lemmy screamed with Iggy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The woozy
officer whipped between the two. &ldquo;At least Ludwig and I came
out unscathed.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thank
the stars. I cannot tolerate any more setbacks!&rdquo; However
instead of walking off in a huff, the blue haired koopaling
inexplicably inched on the ground like a worm&hellip;in a huff.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ho
ho.. Let me find an incident report slip,&rdquo; Snifit Patrol
sighed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The water
tower seemed like the normal option to Bucken-Berry after all.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
breached the hull of the disguised spaceship, larger on the inside,
the interior a mid century living room on side, mad lab the other .
Puzzled at something else present, his eyebrows lowered.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Did
Houdini Toadley conspire with you? I wonder what quenched his
reservations about Miracle Cures..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well..
first of all. Hi, I&rsquo;m Daisy. Princess Daisy Bloom.&rdquo; The
human women had one leg over the other, gaming in Morris&rsquo;
wicker chair. She dropped a game machine into her lap, Pac-Man played
all the way to the kill screen.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
certainly are.&rdquo; Dr. Toad snatched the precious object from the
counter, what he had to conceal, Zoo&rsquo;s diary. That anxiety
clamping at him subsided as it was apparent no one had touched it.
He&rsquo;d never leave it here safekeeping again, not when the x-naut
insisted he never took the ship out of his hangar on the Moon when he
clearly did.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
know this is off topic but, just been to Pinna Park or something?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He felt
the tag from the gift shop on his shirt. Except on the </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">inside</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">.
&ldquo;Princess..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daisy
tacked on, &quot;I got x-ray vision now cause of those rays in junk.
Anyway, yeah Dr. Toadley visited, my people found me and I had to
hide somewhere. People be crazy here, yo.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No
way-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bucken-Berry
burst the hatch open. &ldquo;-Drew watch out there&rsquo;s bad guys
and&hellip; Daisy, you&rsquo;re up??! I mean great but-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
backed into the buffet, mirthfully. &ldquo;I presume you are immune
to heavy radiation after all.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The blue
toad stared blankly. &ldquo;No I ain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
plummeted all the way to the ground and curled up, trembling.
Lightning flashed out of nowhere. They gathered around, Daisy
staggered out, the ranchers and the ostros gaped, King&rsquo;s guards
a mile away snagged binoculars and Thomas at the station was awoken.
Iggy Delta obsequiously faced his brothers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Guess
who'll go back to beta testing from now on?&quot;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Shape
up. We'll go there, alright?&quot; she explained softly, the other
guard's head in her lap. His tears soaked her pants and tank top.
Jon's deterioration was shocking, draining every ounce of
combativeness out of the GI. She stood him up. &quot;We can even play
this board game thing to get through the alley.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
proceeded on to the blue space. Three coins popped out, making her
gasp. She saved face, cooly scooping coinage. &quot;Brilliant.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jon held
his helmet against his hip and groaned, &quot;Let's play this 'ting.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The next
space, a Game Guy spot, didn't do anything. Bridget ignorantly chose
a red space, penalized by the coins poofing into dust. The Bowser was
even worse. With the real guy unavailable, a Bowser Statue spawned
out of mid air and crushed her before phasing away.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
know nuthin 'bout Mario Party,&quot; Jon snarked at her back.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
exasperatedly explained the basics, almost like his old self. They
only hit good spaces onward, Bridget enjoying herself while Jon
lumbered at her heels. They escaped the Game Guy gala, marched
through the dead flower fields, up the steep incline of Royal Raceway
and to where elevation leveled off. It was so hazy over castle
grounds, and so unexpectedly frosty, all they could see that castle
parts were hovering around, joining on their own with uncanny
precision.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Stunned,
Jon snapped a photo with the standard issue polaroid. It developed
and, though they couldn't see it with their naked eye, there was a
white boo hanging around. The castle was known to keep a few of
those, not to mention that killer was one, so they marched off
quickly, so much so they triggered a happening space. Tweester
spawned, forcing gale force winds down the alley. The leathered bag
containing the MacGuffin was launched high in the sky along with
them, dumped out into an adjacent street. Bridget whacked a mail
receptacle. She grimaced from impact and through her teary eyes, she
spotted Prof X-Naut's bag drift into the ether.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Bloody
wonderful,&quot; she said as Jon found her again. Whatever he'd
whacked into, it gave him a black eye.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Why
you freaking out?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;That
was important. I think.&quot; She shrugged if off. &quot;Well, we got
photo evidence of that row back there at least. Here's how the hustle
can go. We avoid cops for now and-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;And
that one too?&quot; he asked, looking over her head.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Someone
yawned behind them, a boo wearing a floppy blue and yellow stared
sleeping cap, floating under the flickering street lamp. The green
Bowser racket hung from their dominant hand, also with a matching
sleeping cap stretched over it. Their hair rose. It couldn't be. Must
of stepped on a boo space back there.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Steal
coins or a Star?&quot; Their eyes then blotted out white for a flash.
&quot;Let me start over. Thought I was.. Working my dismal summer job
in that Game Guy board a block down..&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh,
we can go then-&quot; Jon backed off the sidewalk.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Stop,&quot;
they zoned in on him, freezing him. &quot;I AM who you think. I. Am,
hehe. You want to see Benedict again, don't you?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Y-yeah..?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The boo
swiveled to the other. &quot;And you want&hellip;Trevor Buddy, my
neighbor. Ah, he's not home. Guess that means he broke his promise to
you, yes, even with all of those texts you've sent. &quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She just
resisted going off on that perspicacious creep. &quot;Hey. It's
deeper than you think kid. Let's go Jon.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Not
yet. Let me grant your wishes. To escape.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They wound
their arm up, it obvious what they were about to do with the racket
in those microseconds. Bridget was paralyzed, yet Jon smiled
peacefully, unwavering until he was sliced. With a sickening crack
the frame wedged in the middle of his exposed helmetless forehead. A
thin line of blood ran down and dripped off his chin. The boo
unjammed it from the slot it carved and he crumpled on the spot he
stood, the smack of his split open head on the sidewalk splattering
the other guard's boot with brain matter.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She broke
out of the daze and fired her zapper from her hip, possibly the best
shot in her thirty-four years, a perfect shot between the boo's
widening eyes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~Ladies
and gentleman, we got 'em. No one put a scratch on the toad killer
but her, and all she had to do was become some vagrant that had seen
too much. Oh, and dodge. She didn't during the retaliatory swing of
the racket racket. Bashed flatly in the face, there was a snap, her
lifeless body fell backwards before the entrance of SS HQ</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">See, jokes
on them! Bridget could do cooler things dead, free from her drab and
compulsory society, from the </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">verisimilar</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">,
and come back, ascend, though perhaps not literally, into a new life,
as a dino-rhino next time, or some koopa species or anything. She'd
be fine if a toad all over again, just a different one, but first she
had to descend. Be another King's guard spat in Toad Town..</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo
snatched that photo, squinting as blood from the puncture dripped
into their eyes, rolling off the body into splotchy blue puddles, and
the blistering headache made them wobble. Boo phased into the Super
Spy HQ waiting room to pass out there. Spy Guy might not be that mad,
not even as, in their semi conscious state, they phased through the
floor too, into the pitch black bunker of the maze-like hideout...</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">By a
miracle of Eldstar, Yoshi soared over the desert dunes beyond Toad
Town, but he&rsquo;d lost against the clock. Trepidation seeped into
his system, piloting on pure visuals, unable to determine altitude
with the terrain a black sea. He turned the radio up, again for
response. The cockpit was filled with the sound of banging metal,
then a plunk.</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mu
ha ha ha! At last! -&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">All

and a 3 iron??&rsquo;</font></p>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There were
all sorts of zapping noises, followed by the flop of something heavy.</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Good
job, Spy Guy!&rsquo;</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No
problem N, we were never in danger. I knew he was tracing us since he
conversed with Boo Diddley.&rsquo;</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Who
pilfered the experimental freeze gun?&rsquo;</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ah,
well, they are a citizen I initiated for espionage sir. Because of
them I know the princess has a document that implies-&rsquo;</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Stuff
it Charles. Hey, N, uh, this guy.. See them papers on Mushroom Flu?&rsquo;&rsquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi&rsquo;s
heart raced. Why would that be at this fake airport?</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">N,
he&rsquo;s getting up!&rsquo;</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">My
chronic aversion to glucose food additives has made my blood
impossible to boil, fellow. Surrender my documents. I am blowing the
lid off your hideout.&rsquo;</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No
way!&rsquo;</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yes
you will. Yoink! By the way, all of you, including the bandit in the
full body cast that has purposefully laid on the remote the entire
time, broadcasting all audio live from this secret base as we speak,
have been out of it for the last five minutes due to my Startrooper
mind trick.&lsquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Noooo!&rdquo;
several bellowed under the sound of hot steam.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi&rsquo;s
gaze darted to the clock. There was an incision in his memory of the
last five minutes.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Wow,
I&rsquo;m numb all over but alive..&rdquo; hoarsely babbled someone
under Yoshi, securing the yoke. &ldquo;Some Startrooper mind trick
must have woke me up.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
sprung off his lap. &ldquo;Sonny, my goodness..&rdquo; In his own
state of frenzy, he planted himself in the jumpseat behind. &ldquo;Not
to divulge what I shouldn&rsquo;t, but the pilot abandoned us on
purpose and your uh, &lsquo;base&rsquo; has a nutjob attacking it
right now.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Emerson,
already groggy, deflated with familiarity. &ldquo;Mr. Munchakoopas,
hate to pull a dejavu, but brace.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A peak of
Mt. Rugged was in their path. The aircraft lurched nose up, with a
crunch following somewhere around the tail section, and a sharp veer
downwards. The toad adjusted the flaps at the last moment. They
glided erratically, avoiding another plateau. There were bursts of
orange and yellow speckling the ground from warfare. Then some
humongous creature pulled the plane out of the sky, it&rsquo;s grasp
crushing in the fuselage. The awkward angle made Yoshi tumble
backwards into the cabin. A red slit pupil was trying to search
inside.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><b>SUP,
YOSH! Lemme set this down nice and easy- OWW..</b></font>&rdquo;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A missile
made the creature drop the plane, sticking dino to the ceiling until
impact. Yoshi came to with flames dancing all around him, metallic
scraps and loose debris pitched across the land, and crops ablaze.
Gradually voices faded in. His throat seized from the nauseous fumes
and billowing smoke, crawling on sharp parts, gravitated to his son&rsquo;s
barking, treading embers until colliding with reeds and grass. He was
doused immediately by Snifit Patrol with a garden hose stretched taut
from the train station.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
rolled onto his back, panting, facing red tinted stars. He rolled,
observing beyond Poochy shaking water from singed fur. Tanks and
black spotted mushroom guards were fighting some Kaiju that vaguely
resembled a toad and even more vaguely looked like Bucken-Berry, the
fight veering away from the mountain.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thoughts
of pilot &lsquo;Emerson Lake Toad&rsquo; (he kept reiterating so it
couldn&rsquo;t dissipate, hoping his revival wasn&rsquo;t a dream all
along) swarmed his mind under the locomotive horn blasting.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
burned rubber to show up, weaving through the armory, Snifit Patrol,
and with the aroma of popcorn and cheap theater, only stopped by her
staff blocking the station&rsquo;s entrance with their jaws on the
floor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here at the expected arrival time!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette,
don&rsquo;t you see what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; Joseph looked at
her funny. &ldquo;Even I heard the explosions.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She paled,
taking a gander. &ldquo;Oh.. heavens. Really hyper focused there,&rdquo;
she signed and spoke simultaneously.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Thank
you.&rdquo; Peach swept the parcel straight from her fingers. The
princess had squeezed out the K64 before the squeaky doors completely
opened.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The pink
toad tagged along, appalled at her condition. &ldquo;Princess are you
okay?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
monarch simply nodded as she marched, stumbled rather, down the
mountain path the way Toadette just came, equally as imperturbable.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
uncomfortably put on a smile for the staff. &ldquo;It appears I
learned from the best.&rdquo;</font></p>

<p>She'd committed to hiding, now she might as well seek or try to, backing off from the last of three green buttons. The labels were in her native language, not too weird in a spaceship as much as aliens loved to stalk around Sarasaland. It was the translations making her leery, saying stuff like... 'Do not put under children of 3 years.' 'Carefully slip and fall?' 'Infinite pleasure?'</p>

<p>Meanwhile disturbances outside were generating deep percussive booms, rattling the world. They had to safely relocate using one of the buttons and levers scattered around the living arrangements. In desperation Daisy smacked the other two options, making that machine that had fallen on the floor spark to life and cough up dozens of screws and unidentified parts. The lights blinked, though there was no cord or power source.</p>

<p>After tying his blonde hair back to regain some appearance of professionalism, Dr. Toad heaved the machine back on the lab table. "Of course. Morris fully embraces his paper form! Princess, I suggest you depart while you can. I'd loathe to get you in trouble with Mr. X."</p>

<p>Well, if only he knew that firstly, she'd already heard of Mr. X, he like the aliens hung around her desert land, (though unlike the aliens he would ask for permissions in long detailed letters) and secondly she <em>loathed</em> to let 'Peachy' down way more.</p>

<p>"Don't worry about it doc. He recognized my name and sent me down here, but otherwise it ain't nothing, and he especially got nothing to do with the artifacts in my backyard and little jerks like Zoo Diddley using them... But you've hardly heard of that."</p>

<p>"No I wouldn't.." Dr. Toad murmured, quickly requesting the first tech support he could on the pda.</p>

<p>A proudly licensed technician beamed in, wearing a blue logo embroidered polo and matching ballcap. "Greetings, Iggy of Nerd Squad here!" The cyborg koopaling's ocular sensors retracted at the scenery. "Oooooh crap," he mouthed.</p>

<p>Dr. Toad opened his wallet. "Repair this please."</p>

<p>Iggy accepted the coins, wary of a princessy death glare from behind. "Sure! I'll, uh, proceed with the emergency call, only this is a liiiiittle short of my new rates. Sure I no longer need to sleep and can teleport anywhere, but I can't be a charity while saving up for the upcoming PlayStation-"</p>

<p>Dr. Toad shoved more at him and pushed him before the sparking and grinding fax, its death throes. Iggy skittishly unrolled a tool kit and began. The toad doctor was so engrossed as the koopaling sorted disassembled bits with expertise, he didn't notice that there were five angry Hiyoihoi, moai secret service agents, cornering them against the lab table with huge rocks dwarfing the tall pencil thin geeks.</p>

<p>"Hold up! That guy caused this stuff!" Daisy fussed, commanding their attention across the table with a shaking fist.</p>

<p>The toad doctor shrugged. "I suppose I had a more fluid idea of heroes and villains and what they do in their off time."</p>

<p>The princess's fist froze. "Yeah, it is weird when we're fine one moment and fighting the next week. Go on. Long as Bowser and his folks aren't being a nuisance and kidnapping people."</p>

<p>"-Who hasn't?" Dr. Toad covered his mouth. Thankfully Iggy's eureka moment was the prominent spectacle.</p>

<p>The eighteen year old raised a mangled up sheet of paper from the feed. Cleaning his glasses- "OMG. It's Dr. Mario's, page one of five-thousand!"</p>

<p>Dr. Toad snatched it up, scintillating as if holding Gold Bar x3, if short-lived. "...We should move out of the way of 4999."</p>

<p>Every document stuck in limbo was unleashed machine gun style, pages knocking some of them off their feet worse. The lamp was struck at the base, crying 'OUCH!'. The others dove for cover until the whirling fax machine slowed down for a full HD color print out. Spying through the gaps in the wicker chair he'd ducked behind, Dr. Toad witnessed the shoes, pants, white coat, and ultimately head of Prof. Morris X-Naut roll out, floating tranquility to the orange shag carpet.</p>

<p>"That's for disregarding my PhD in revenge, secret agents!" He flipped upward, fists raised until his younger toad friend tapped him on the shoulder, unenthused. The space alien quickly shaped up, hands behind his back. "I didn't waste eighteen hours for folly, Drew.. Oh look, I remembered to send Dr. Mario's notes ahead of myself in the queue, freshly starched."</p>

<p>A camera flashed from an unknown location.</p>

<p>"Wow oh wow. In the nick of time, the missing professor and the Mushroom Flu notes are found WITH the assistance of a koopaling behind the pandemic? Scoop of the CENTURY!"</p>

<p>The unnoticed lamp removed its shade, revealing a baggy eyed Kylie Koopa, unaffected by the nasty paper cut on her knees. "Iggy fella, was that redemption planned?"</p>

<p>The koopaling ripped off the shirt, puffing out his chest. "Yes! This is my arc, my true destiny! Super Mercenary Iggy Delta... Desu!" Kylie snapped more of him before she was tackled by Daisy's servants.</p>

<p>"I'll uh, ack! *cough* I'll change names in the reports!" The reporter gasped from the bottom of the pile up. "PLEASE! At least share the findings with MK East tonight!"</p>

<p>"Fine! Huff!" Prof X-Naut groaned loudly. He pulled down an industrial looking lever with the most alarming Engrish statement yet, 'Enjoy your fright'. Everyone felt a centrifugal force.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Jr. Troopa's phone was on silent while waving his brightest torch around the darkness, the magnitude of the wreckage scarily impressive for an aircraft that could have fit in his parent's garage. He wouldn't want to look like some distracted, technology bound young adult in front of such a big shot observing his efforts. Fragments of shrapnel were still warm as he picked through, trying his best. No toad pilot or tackle box. Tail between his legs, the paratroopa showed the gauze wrapped dinosaur fragments of a bronze object.</p>

<p>"The rest must have gotten up and walked away." He adjusted his ten-gallon, remaining shorter than the dinosaur. "That good or bad?"</p>

<p>Yoshi fixed the face he was making. "-It's great! I appreciate it." He accepted what was left of the Bronze Egg, mouth tightening. Sonny being some secret agent couldn't have made him immune to injury, furthermore this made an unidentified body unaccounted for twice.</p>

<p>A kart circumvented the koopa, yoshi, and reluctantly leashed poochy on the rural stroll to civilization, suspension squeaking from rough terrain.</p>

<p>The window rolled down. "Mr. Munchakoopas, I know you are eager to join Mario. Hop in."</p>

<p>Jr. Troopa felt for his pop gun at the sight of Captain Toad. It was one of those hair on the back of the neck raising feelings someone like Drew his, uh ex, would disregard. Well it was a thing, Troopa was as certain of it as he was that the sun would rise in a few hours. That toad would be stopped tonight.</p>

<p>-Or, would have. The buzzing in his pocket was unbearable, keeping him from popping a tire. Calls from all over flooding in, a real flying saucer sweeping above. He turned around and- ZOOM, rocked out of his cowboy boots.</p><hr />

<p>Mushroomites in slippers and night caps clambered to windows or poured from darkened homes onto the streets to get a glimpse at their sovereign, cheering at her return. This continued without letup all the way to the chokepoint of Royal Raceway. Peach separated from the Cloud 9 of the Lakitu Bros and continued with the assistance of an aide, discovering her castle exactly how it used to be. The painted white stone was radiant in the moonlight, pink roof tiles unblemished, wrap-around sandstone driveway immaculate. The only blotch of her opulent abode was perhaps that the mysterious contractor did not get to the lawn yet, patchy parched grass, zero arrangements, and the gnome Ksitigarbha missing- that and there were a dozen pipe frame carts lined up and waiting.</p>

<p>"Princess, er.. Surprise!" The approaching black spotted toad tipped their officer's cap. Like an ant trooper infestation, they could never shake these pests!</p>

<p>Toadette slid from behind Peach, scrutinizing 'Warden Dylan' closely, uniformed in dark blue like a typical police force- blatantly not the original wave of King's officers. While they might not have faced Booigi's wrath, they and the rest of the squad interestingly had a few minor scuffs and scrapes. "How did you do it??" </p>

<p>"Our squadron arrived only an hour ago, after completion. You are not to question the King, steward. He's already spoken." They revealed a note, once tapped to the doors. It was the official parchment with the seal, handwritten in the middle with cursive: </p>

<p>'Gift from your future KING.'  </p>

<p>With the celebrating crowd catching up and washing the rest of her friends in, there was no peace to ponder anything. The interior, some of their old belongings, the leaky faucet in the basement, all restored to a level of convincing detail. Toad was the last to arrive 'home', the vision from the Vrlrdyi scope zombifying his gait more than usual. This castle wasn't was he saw spring from nothingness, but he wished it was so there would be less questions. The King was once known for his mastery over bricks, the famous brown kind, via his scepter, a major player in his great post WW63 kingdom expansion. <em>Peach Castle did not contain those bricks however...</em></p>

<p>"You okay?"</p>

<p>Toad blinked at Mario, completely alone in the doorway. "Totally..."</p>

<p>The red plumber told the lingering guards to hightail it and they did, eager to do so as there was something coming, huge. Civilian stragglers fled as a three headed eel monster, larger than an Unagi anyone had seen, slithered onto castle grounds, its glistening blue skin emitting a radioactive red glow.</p>

<p>
  <b>Heeeeelp!!! Don't let them blow me up Mr. Toadsworth!!!</b>
</p>

<p>Only a few feet from the open doorway, the elder's tea cup slipped from his grasp. "T-the m-monster w-was a t-toad, eh wot?"</p>

<p><b>"I don't look like a toad anymore?"</b> The middle head swiveled back and forth with the other heads. <b>"We don't?"</b> asked the leftmost head. <b>"I'll do a trick. Cool Blue style. Somebody come here,"</b> said the right, seizing control. <b>"I will..</b> try to speak normally. I respect privacy."</p>

<p>Mario stepped up, protectively closing the entrance door partially behind him.</p>

<p>"Curtis Mario, you secretly sold your castle after Luigi won his mansion. That's why it never shows up in games anymore. Months after the incident, every time you heard a boo cackle you'd wet-"</p>

<p>The plumber spun back in, petrified. "This is definitely our Mario encyclopedia- I mean Bucken-Berry."</p>

<p>"Oh heavens. What will we do with you?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Toadsworth um.. Closer. Sam, can I say that? Your secret is..oh weird." Slit pupils thinning out, the nostrils of all three heads flared open. "You smell like death.. I can't describe it. Is this a trick?? I wanted Toadsworth, you phony!" Their spines rose, and their cheeks filled from something amber. </p>

<p>The old mushroom man screamed madly, retreating behind Mario. "He's unstable and about to-!"</p>

<p>Hot lava deluged the lobby, leaving Mario and co scrambling out of the way. They gawked from the mezzanine at the searing pool, melting all of the princess's furniture on ground level, the podium, her chairs, the sun rug.. The curtains caught fire and heat bulged out and shattered many of the windows. Peach burst open the upper level doors, breathing rapidly in her nightgown. </p>

<p>"This is why I have no choice but to welcome my father tomorrow."</p>

<p>Later in those early hours, Toad snuck out, easily from this lonely third floor,  wondering what the heck was going on with two folks. What freaked Bucken-Berry out? He waited at the lake until mosquitos drained a quarter of his blood. No answer. Okay, then what happened to Luigi on the way? Again nothing, at least by text.</p><hr />

<p>During the rescue parade, Luigi diverted to the precinct upon catching stray chatter of Boo being held there. He found the desk unoccupied in the ex-fast food joint. No ostentatious if earnest Snifit Patrol, bumbling but kind Inspector Douglas, or grouchy but diligent Sergeant Howie. Luigi wandered around until at a hard corner, where an array of bars lined both sides of a hallway. He was drawn to a casted foot sticking out of one cell. Turns out it was only the cast. A cot was left behind and lots of wrappings on it, like the person crawled out and got away. The messily written note on the ground, on the back of a receipt for a shoe polish store, confirmed such.</p>

<p>'Yeah mane, I been healed up and bounced like SSHQ always do. Coming back for the captain too, like it or not. -0069'</p>

<p>"The heck?" he thought out loud, pouring over the rest of the cell.</p>

<p>Imprisoned was possibly that captain, a middle aged yoshi businessman on the bench. Sitting up, he had a hauntingly blank stare, drool from the side of his open mouth creating a puddle. Last was Boo Diddley in the corner, facing the concrete wall. A sliver of moonlight from the window hit them partially, illuminating exactly half of them from the back down to the tail.</p>

<p>He grabbed the bars, relief wafting over him. "Buddy! I made it. Bowser was taken care of. Everything's better, okay?"</p>

<p>Barely perceptible, they squeaked, "Is it, Luigi?"</p>

<p>Perspicaciously, something made him step back. "Comparatively. I realize what led to what the columnists are calling your 'day of retribution' hasn't been dealt with. Just bear with me. To be brutally honest, I'm learning as the champion of the kingdom that there are a lot of issues beneath the faade we have of being so far ahead of the others and 'better'. I get it, but Peach had to be our priority or we couldn't have even begun. Do you get it?"</p>

<p>He let go, the pressure from his hands fogging the steel. A belated thought hit him. Why hadn't boo gotten out of here? It would surely be easier for them than whoever 'cot and wrappings' person was. They must be ridden with guilt right? Or-</p>

<p>"Luigi. Yes. This entire time.. Something got into me."</p>

<p>The boo slowly rotated, making the green plumber's smile fade. Boo had a puncture, a perfectly centered head wound and gazing into it, something was escaping, impalpable, and clawing out for him. During his studies with Prof. E. Gadd, the mentor himself only had the briefest notes on this arcane phenomenon of the boo, the usual possessor, being possessed, creating a psionic vacuum.</p>

<p>"And now it's getting out of you," he sputtered.</p>

<p>They glided closer. "I'll be brutally honest too... No wait. I'll just be brutal."</p>

<p>Back against the opposite bars, Luigi steeled himself. His mind had to be a fortress against the wicked rays, except like the real thing, cracks were inevitable. "Why?" he croaked, sliding to the floor, eyes propped open. To resist was muscle tearing.</p>

<p>"You are in love with a toad."</p>

<p>A response crawled out of his throat, the rest of him disintegrating from the top down. "I..don't know that yet, Boo!"</p>

<p>"Booigi. Boo is somewhere safe, and I know you don't. This was a warning. You won't get another."</p>

<p>He got out.</p>

<p>How?</p>

<p>And out of what?</p>

<p>The green plumber wasn't sure. He was somewhere in his own grassy yard. One lamp on in a window. Gill T's abode next door still dark and empty and the other house on the opposite side still for sale. An early morning paper thwacked him in the back.</p><hr />

<p>Toad Town News: MK Hospital East and South join peacefully at Peach's Stadium, curing all Mushroom Flu patients with custom Dr. Mario patented mega-vitamin. Special thanks to: International Medical University of Special World, Princess Daisy Bloom, Ignatius H Koopa, and an anonymous local reporter.</p>

<p>....</p>

<p>And that was it. The castle would have rather they'd overshared like usual. Every bit of their routine wouldn't be so off kilter this morning. Joseph flung the covers off his bunk bed, oversleeping with his special alarm clock not vibrating the bed. Peach's car keys were thus misplaced in weeds, then the trip to the market took forever. The washing machine was overloaded and bubbles filled the castle, breakfast items were missing like the butter, jammin jelly etc, despite Chef Tim's best effort and so on. The topic of Kinopio-Kun arose from nowhere. Toadette kept her head down, blushed. They understandably didn't understand his decision, but she shelved white knighting him for the moment. Toadsworth looked horrible.</p>

<p>The heavy star patterned blankets just swallowed him up nearly. The only time his hoarse voice was heard was when asking the adjacent toad, Thomas, to rip open a box of something, the label marked out. The kid's head was barely above the table level, picking at the mushrooms on the china silently. No one put on a particularly strong display that they had this under control except for one, and sliding his clean plate away, he was about to leave.</p>

<p>"Don't worry. I'll beat Elderberry back."</p>

<p>Toadsworth nodded at Peach with some coded expression.</p>

<p>"Mr. Toad, wait a moment." The princess gently patted her face with a napkin. "We are ready to see the message!"</p>

<p>A King's officer stepped in, impervious to all of the scathing or alarmed glances. They held a tablet fixed to a virtual meeting, the person on the other end represented by a B symbol. The toads crowded around as the camera cut on, revealing Bowser! His background indicated Dark Land with a red sky and volcanoes, though no castle was in sight, his troops bustling around in the distance from under temporary tents.</p>

<p>"Bwa ha ha! It is I, King Bowser! I bet you and your dumb toads are rarely surprised by stuff, so here's a treat. We started it, and we ended it. Check your papers. We, the Koopa Troop, take (partial..) responsibility for curing the Mushroom Flu! ...I don't know how you got a castle already and NOT ME! But whatever, all we want for payment is.. Not to kidnap you but.." Someone off screen whispered, Bowser responding with a subdued groan. "Alright, we want all your old treasures."</p>

<p>"NO!" Peach replied, scaring some in the kitchen into flipping plates into the air.</p>

<p>Their savior was another user hopping on. Mario and Luigi were on a couch at their home, identified easily by the game collection displayed behind them. Mario was animatedly speaking with Luigi beside him, an ice pack on his head and a whole lot else off, at least Toad noticed right away.</p>

<p>"Mario, you're muted!" Toad said.</p>

<p>Sheepishly the plumber reached around the screen. "Got it. Bowser, you were supposed to get on with us first. How did you threaten them so far?"</p>

<p>"I didn't do nuthin!"</p>

<p>"Cut it out. You wanna get wrecked twice in twenty-four hours?" Luigi snipped, the directness of this tone having immediate effect.</p>

<p>"I was just throwing out facts... According to YOUR news! It's my son worried about some artifact deal.."</p>

<p>"Vater, be discreet!" cried that person off screen again.</p>

<p>Toadsworth in the far rear wavered. "What is his progress?" he asked Zeror to ask the tablet, deferring attention. The green toad tried to speak up, unable to succeed with the topic moving on.</p>

<p>"So, we're hunky dory right?" Mario whistled for someone.</p>

<p>"What up what up!" Daisy sat on Luigi's side, in some baggy casual clothing, not what she wore at the game, nor the hospital smock they'd expect.</p>

<p>Then Yoshi flopped down next to Mario, waving. Below at his knees Poochy circled around, wagging.</p>

<p>"Figured we'd all want to see each other before splitting off," Mario began, his cheery tone not fooling anyone. "After all, once Peach's dad gets here..."</p>

<p>"...What, Mario?" she asked, leaning in.</p>

<p>"Well, he'll be a handful won't he?"</p>

<p>Mario left it like that. Possibly he caught on that a King's guard was in proximity, or he was behaving appropriately because it was like that. This was why her adoration for him would never wane, no matter how much she knew it wasn't as perfect a match as most believed, or how much she was starting to think of someone else on the Zoom call.</p><hr />

<p>Someone tiptoed across the molten rock in the lobby, inconveniently blocking the basement (something to deal with later since the leak wasn't fixed..). Sun rays reached castle grounds early from the fissure in Star Hill and, he thanked the stars, no guards were hanging around anymore. He rushed to the street, carefully dodging mud with his nice shoes. A sail equipped New Donk City cab should have been there for a quick in and out. It wasn't. He sent a text every minute nagging, in the process finding a message from his doctor about the need for a pacemaker. Way to make him feel his age, just before he met his Special One at a special place..</p>

<p>"-HI-YAA- *cough* I mean, sup Mr. Toad ova there."</p>

<p>He glanced up at the gang.</p>

<p>"No trouble here, man. Just lookin!"</p>

<p>"Her place's really back!"</p>

<p>"I know. I'm tripping."</p>

<p>The red, black, yellow, and green ninjas ogled every inch of the property. They had been working hard it appeared, sweaty, with tool belts on their hips and fluorescent construction hats, quite a career change for a once vicious Koopa Troop aligned gang.</p>

<p>"Are you fixing the basement?!" he yelled over.</p>

<p>The black one, Eggplant, twisted around. "We're temps for all that construction going on downtown so no, old man. Call a private contractor." The bros snickered.</p>

<p>Toad let them be, gravitating to his reflection in the murky lake. He hadn't worn a suit since the Mario All-Stars event, adding to it a top hat and carrying hooked white cane. He looked spiffy!.. If he kept repeating it. Better go for this now prove to himself he's not lost it, than wonder, have nerves eat him alive while also dealing with Peach's father for a week or more. Some rowdiness made his ears perk. He rolled his eyes.</p>

<p>"WOOO! Catch!"</p>

<p>"Over here! Over here!"</p>

<p>Yep, the Koopa Bros were cooling off in the moat. Whatever except- Toad thought he was imagining. Their 'ball' arcing in the air was one of their precious lost garden gnomes.</p>

<p>He rolled his sleeves up. "I'm gonna kill em.."</p>

<p>With each step closer, a ninja was mysteriously pulled under. Something moved swiftly downstream and a second later, a pile of koopa bones shot onto land.</p>

<p>Toad staggered to the shore. "WHY? AHHH!" All of the shell colors were there, with ribs, skulls, femurs.. He went green, queasy as the surface undulated. It was right there. "Uh, hey. Let's talk... We'll tell Peach it was a mistake okay?... And weren't you vegan?"</p>

<p>Three pairs of red eyes became visible from the deep. Toad braced-</p>

<p>"-I'm sorry Mr. Toad. I hadn't had breakfast and.. I don't know anymore! Just let me go. Fire me!"</p>

<p>The Earl breathed out slowly, still alive- for then. "Yvan, chill-"</p>

<p>The steward's baleful form was curled up, several feet below the surface. Despite that, his words came out clear and blunt enough to nearly give Toad a concussion. "Chill?!? I'm freaking killing people!!! -And it's not on a battlefield so we can't pretend it's okay!!!!"</p>

<p>The suited toad buttoned and unbuttoned the end of his dress coat over and over, paling. "..I see that."</p>

<p>"-Forget whatever plan you're cooking up. I've always been some freakazoid and unlike you, I can't get away with it."</p>

<p>"Stop there-" Toad cut him off. "There's nothing to envy with me. At least when you lost your family, they loved you."</p>

<p>He thought he perceived the slits in the water widening. "What are you talking about?"</p>

<p>Toad slipped off the increasingly constricting dress coat. "I never got away with being 'different' at all. I didn't just choose to stay here with Peach after her dad left, I didn't have a choice. I was disowned. I wasn't into toads. Kinda- actually a huge deal then, and triple as much for a noble purebred. I thought it wouldn't bother me like that, I hated the nobles all anyway, but it did- for a long time, to the point where.. even today I have trouble, you know, shooting my shot with anyone I like, as if they're watching. From Hell."</p>

<p>"...Sorry."</p>

<p>Toad tied on a super cape, energized enough to fly out of there if he had a running start. "Why should you be for me? Enough of that. None of us are getting younger, so don't let the past control you anymore. What's the first thing you'd wanna work on, man? Being weird or whatever doesn't count anymore."</p>

<p>"...Sir- keeping in check I guess, whatever form I'm in."</p>

<p>"No that's perfect. And mature."</p>

<p>"-Really?"</p>

<p>"And we'll work on that. Hang in there. I'll be back before it gets bad. I promise, alright?"</p>

<p>Quite a bit daunted, the monster watched the cape feathered toad take off like a little jet in the sky. He sighed, somehow less miserable than he began.</p>

<p>"-Alright."</p><hr />

<p>A blur from the other side of the world beat the Sunset Express on full steam to the Tangerino Grill, a famed one paint star restaurant with contemporary styling, two floors, and a luxurious VIP area. The cape wearer scoped it out when his date appeared out of nowhere, pointing upwards and- BAM! Colliding with a billboard, he plummeted below, bouncing off the roof, an open umbrella at an outside table, and in the midst of all the tourists from the arriving train, getting trampled.</p>

<p>"Toad!" They parted through toads to assist him, readjusting his top hat. "People wait for months for a reservation. Don't die before our name's called."</p>

<p>He still didn't know what made the plumber in the tuxedo so extra snarky, but he loved it. "Totally." Toad, after coughing up dirt, offered a stringy purple piranha flower, mailed in super early today from SPACE. Hopefully that made up for how his stunt put them in the back of the line.</p>

<p>Luigi accepted, smiling so wonderfully. "Thank you... How much was it?"</p>

<p>The violins Toad totally wasn't imagining screeched not so romantically. Thankfully the receipt was long gone.</p>

<p>"I'm kidding!" Luigi gave him a gift too, a bronze little egg thing, riddled with lines where it had been melded together.</p>

<p>"Sweet, man!" Toad rattled the Bronze Egg around. "...Wait, what does it hatch into? Peach is weird about some pets.."</p>

<p>"Nothing- Er, I hope. Ha ha." They laughed.</p>

<p>Hands cooly in his pockets, Toad breathed out slowly. There is nothing to get too excited over. He'd seen Luigi like this a few times before, in that black, well-fitted tuxedo too. His full head of brown hair was gelled back and his voluptuous darker brown mustache was trimmed up, just the perfect contrast against olive skin. The only little issue, it mostly hid his lips, especially while breathing in that flower. Toad paid way too much, but it couldn't be that great.</p>

<p>"So how do you want to swing in? Like with swagger? Or low-key? Or roll a D12?...Luigi?"</p>

<p>Frazzled, Luigi rose from the plant. "-OH. Sorry I.. had a.. strange morning. Whatever you're comfortable with-."</p>

<p>"Perfect!" Toad boldly reached for Luigi's full gloveless hand. A spark traveled up the Earl's arm, to the rest of his nervous system, making him the happiest a toad could be while in a miserably long line, back pressed against the map boundary-</p>

<p>"Zhis is merde!" grumbled a toad host pressing through the crowd. "Reservations first please! Hey, zhey have one!"</p>

<p>Additional waiters came out and dragged Luigi and Toad in beyond countless leering toads, tossing them into the moodily lit dining room with hardwood floors, beige plaster walls, and assorted culinary knickknacks decorating the wall. A Peddler Toad with a glint in his eye ambushed, intruding on Mr. Toad in particular.</p>

<p>"I sell spare pizza dough. You'll never know when you'll need that around here!"</p>

<p>Hardly having a moment to dust himself off, "No thanks. I think I do know that I won't need that, homeboy.."</p>

<p>"How about salt, pepper, lemons?.. To make it zesty!..." He gave up, hiding his wares. "You don't like zest?.. I KNOW YOU! YOU"RE FAMOUS-"</p>

<p>Toad zoomed away in a flash. Shortly Luigi tapped gently on the door of the restroom, Toad dry heaving in there. He thought. A waiter had their table ready and on cue, Toad reappeared, playing off his blanched nature. They were led through the dining room, beyond antsy looking toads, and seated in a red themed partitioned and candle-lit VIP area with a smaller more intimate table.</p>

<p>When the menu was placed in Toad's paws, the selection of Italian and grilled delicacies crowded out much else. His steak request was denied suspiciously. There was no one to 'defeat' it. Luigi chose the Momma Mia Pizza and since it was the size of the table, they could share. As VIPs, a chef came along and 'entertained' by flipping the soft powdery dough in the air until it arched over and burst out their window.</p>

<p>The red faced chef brushed the shattered glass away with his foot. "Gentlemen, just an itty bitty wait. Dough quantity is low due to those black market fiends."</p>

<p>To complete the cringe package, he left the curtains half open, exposing them to the other diners with empty plates.</p>

<p>Staring intensified.</p>

<p>Toad scooted up closer, ignoring it. "So-"</p>

<p>"-How long?"</p>

<p>He paused. "At this rate like an hour...Oh, you mean. Me." Toad slapped himself. "It's when you won that mansion. I had the crap scared out of me man, along with everyone else Peach sent to find your brother. Still not sure how she thought that would work, but whatever. What did you mean by that polka dots bit?"</p>

<p>"That?" Luigi shifted, introspectively. "It means what you think! Huh.. that far back?"</p>

<p>"Eh.. I had issues to sort out. What about you?"</p>

<p>Luigi blushed, compulsively arranging and rearranging silverware. "I- honestly I hadn't thought of us together before you asked, but I just wanna see how it goes. I always thought you're great so why not."</p>

<p>A waiter had come around with beverages, the wrong ones, and courtesy appetizers, even wronger. Toad gulped the fizzy drink down regardless, his throat so dry it didn't matter.</p>

<p>"-I hope that's not more casual than you were expecting," the plumber continued. "With you running for mayor in Neo Bowser City, and I doing my thing, would we have time for anything serious?"</p>

<p>Toad clinked the glass down, countenance flattening. "No it's appropriate. Ha.. I'm about to do the most subversive thing a Toad like me could and I'd better focus on that. I'm pleading to every star, even the obscure ones for this, Aurelius, Iris, Adrian, etc to make it work out. Still, don't you think they want us to be happy, responsibilities or not?"</p>

<p>Luigi reached over the table of small diameter, holding his semi muscled upper arm. "Yeah I do... In fact that was beautiful."</p>

<p>"You are more." Lost in his blue optimistic eyes, a greedy side took over. Toad gently reached around the nape of his neck and met the rest of the way, navigating around Luigi's nose, the mustache, zoning in on the plumber's lips and pressing against them with his for the briefest one in a half seconds of his life when-</p>

<p>Oh Eldstar- A hoard of toads violently ripped the rest of the curtain down, crowding their table. "Did we hear something about Bowser over here? That was the last problematic VIP that closed down the kitchen. Get them!"</p>

<p><em>"I'm hungry!" "My butt went to sleep!" "My husband left me." "Luigi wouldn't- or WOULD do this!</em>" etc physically battered them.</p>

<p>"Ugh. Here's something for all that whine!" Toad threw a giant cheese wheel at the toads. The heavy thing rolled into the nearby kitchen, seemingly triggering a cacophony. Cooks escaped, arms in the air. On instinct, Luigi super jumped over several heads to peep in. Pots and pans littered the floor, food was dying at the pass or sizzling to carbon on the stoves, and the freezer was wide open, blasting ice. Most chillingly however was the sous chef curled up next to the cutting table, their life drained by a shy guy with a paper straw.</p>

<p>A crinkled yellow toad creased over a spoke of the ceiling fan, a head chef, reanimated. "Help!"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry alright! I'll never waste cheese again!" Toad materialized at Luigi's side. "...I caused this, right?"</p>

<p>Sensing an extra person, the shy guy bent backwards with an unnatural ninety degree angle, making eye contact as horror violin chords screeched from some incorporeal location.</p><hr />

<p>Toadette angled it downwards at the six red eyes in the depths, a sports program on. "Is this sufficient?"</p>

<p>"Uh.. Yeah."</p>

<p>When she tripped a bit on the chord afterwards, he wanted to reach out and help her. He certainly could reach with the tendrils, even when submerged. He hesitated too much and missed his chance. She'd recovered, and had their outside joint situated, the TV, extension cords, Ksitigarbha for spiritual motivation, and anyone willing to hang with a man eating monster. That turned out to be, besides her, Thomas, and Chef Tim for a reason only he knew.</p>

<p>Conclusively it wasn't because he liked Mario Strikers games.</p>

<p>"-I thought this was soccer? They're scoring so much it's boring!"</p>

<p>"Chef, there are other televisions you can watch," Toadette droned.</p>

<p>"Ms. Toadette, can I keep these?" Thomas asked all a sudden, holding a picnic basket that held picked clean white bones.</p>

<p>"Eeek! What's that?!" the chef flipped off of his upside down bucket</p>

<p>"Remember, he's used to this kinda stuff!" the monster reminded them. "Forget it Timothy. It's nothing...unlike that birdo player in the 4 jersey."</p>

<p>"Huh?" Toadette asked.</p>

<p>"No not like that.. they're from Donut Plains. I don't know why they keep tryin to pass them off as Yoshi Islanders. Sound nothing alike."</p>

<p>Ah, great subject change the pink toad thought, especially with the new kid playing catch.</p>

<p>"Sir, may I ask how you became so proficient?"</p>

<p>"I've met a lot of different people kid, at the orphanage and on adventures now."</p>

<p>"Sorry, sir."</p>

<p>"Don't be. Tim should be sorry he didn't drop any snacks in that wipeout though.."</p>

<p>Huffing, the orange toad got up, as peevishly as his mother Zess T. "Fine, back to that empty shell of a castle. Here's something for you, by the way." He passed along the other half of the document from Hotel Mario, Toadette jolting as she accepted.</p>

<p>"How long were you sitting on this Tim??"</p>

<p>"Is that a fat joke?"</p>

<p>"What- no! I meant-"</p>

<p>"Kidding!.. You were so engrossed in that sports game."</p>

<p>Exasperatedly, she checked it out.</p>

<p>"You know I had to sneak into Zeror's room while he was showering for that. He could check that rash... Anyway, yes that is dangerous, just like other articles I was told to burn on my first day. Samuel showed which from the basement archives. That's why I sabotaged Zeror, Joe, and Les with the dessert."</p>

<p>She covered her mouth. "Stars in heaven.."</p>

<p>"Miss Toadette, are you okay?"</p>

<p>She turned to Thomas, nodding. "We should analyze this indoors. Blue, need anything?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. Phone."</p>

<p>Without questioning, she placed a cordless one at the water's edge. Once they were gone, a thin tendril surfaced and called long distance to Ricco Harbor, fulfilling that check-in he never got a chance to last night.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>"Hey, Brah. It's high tide and people are everywhere, swarming. Can hardly breathe. Gotta go-"</p>

<p>The monster quickly stood from the lake, revealing semi-translucent skin, two tree trunk sized legs and giant swooper-like wings on his back. From his armless sides sprouted the innumerable tendrils, stretched out in surprise. "Ala-Gold.. You're okay?!"</p>

<p>
  <em>"Better than okay, brah. I'm home."</em>
</p>

<p>Bucken-Berry leapt on land, stomping around out in the open, not caring.  "So you reanimate at home, or however you're alive again and don't tell me?!? I loved you dude. I'm sorry I treated you like crap sometimes!"</p>

<p>"Oh."</p>

<p>"Yes dude!!! God, I'm so messed up inside.. I'll stay on the meds this time and- stop blaming other people for everything. I don't even have beef with Mr. Toad anymore like you and Toadette hated. Just come back. I'll never hurt you again, I promise."</p>

<p>"Only now?? Too late to salvage, brah!" his friend jabbed. "Think Toad or Toadette or Thomas can shield you now that you're that freak? Just give u- I mean, join <em>me</em> here." The tension in the golden toad's deep voice eased. "You'd be safe from uh, those tanks and banzai bills, Cool Blue."</p>

<p>Bucken-Berry's gargantuan strides lead him to Star Hill, the pelt of stray star bits on his scales waking him up with one three toed foot  hanging off the gorge, a bottomless pit in the center of the mountain. He hurled himself backward, smashing trees.</p>

<p>-Still there, brah?"</p>

<p>The floodgates opened, the monster's eyes opening. "Yeah.. I'll stay here. Where you're at doesn't sound fun. You know I need space."</p>

<p>"Cool Blue-"</p>

<p>"-And you ALWAYS refused to call me that! I don't think you know me anymore."</p>

<p>"...I should have never shielded you," he hissed.</p>

<p>Bucken-Berry felt the spines flare again. "You didn't. Ala-Gold did. WHO ARE YOU, PUNK!?!" bellowed across the entire kingdom. Lowering the phone, the left head noticed they'd death-breathed it into melted plastic. Darn. That was castle property...</p>
<hr/>

<p>The ceiling fan chef cried, "Unlock that cabinet!"</p>

<p>Toad barged forward, rolling under the fire billowing from the ovens. His klutzy skull bash undid the latch and from out of it split another shy guy with a white hat, the Tangerino Grill's secret weapon. Luigi used the cane to hook Toad away as the Slurp Guy's straw punctured the attacker and drained his paint. Shunned Guy twisted around at an abnormal angle, latching on the Slurp Guy to drain them back.</p>

<p>"It's an infinite paint exchange cycle over there, an ouroboros.."</p>

<p>"Oww.. Phrasing.. I mean thanks." Woozily, trying to grab both the plumber and the wall to stand, Toad flipped a wall switch, speeding up the fan.</p>

<p>Luigi caught the chef, both going down and tipping hot pans. Toad caught them in turn, only forgetting the fireball jetting across the kitchen. Melting out the freezer, a steam cloud and wave of ice water swept them out! While the paper characters panicked, the snazzy duo collided against the dessert display, layer cakes and someone's abandoned to-go order flipping into their laps. Luigi couldn't believe how absurd this Paper Mario entry was. Why wasn't he in it? Or was he?</p>

<p>During that crisis, Toad patted his shoulder, idly munching on the sweets like a starved barbarian with the other hand. It was like gravel down his throat, and the cheese curls flavorless, lacking... zest.</p>

<p>"Blessings unto you gentlemen." Someone disturbed a puddle next to Toad. "Looks like this is a destination the brigade can skip," chattered a yellow toad, not of the staff here, in adventurer's garb with tan thick pants and hiking boots. 

Lifting from his crumb filled suit to J&ouml;rg, Mr. Toad's eyes widened. He screamed.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>They came to facing upwards, tied and bound to the roof of a station wagon kart. It sped treacherously and weaving around palm trees on the coastal edge of Water Land with a siren blasting police kart close behind. They were dressed like at the outing, but the time was ambiguous, Toad's watch irretrievable and the sky purple and hazy, no sun visible as smoggy as it felt.</p>

<p>Luigi squeezed his eyes shut. "I knew I'd obtained a head injury at some point.."</p>

<p>Cool as the other side of the pillow, Toad used his free enough hand to stab through the roof beneath them with a blade, prying it open like a can. "Wasn't a dream. Stan will wish it was..."</p>

<p>Luigi turned to him and back, eyebrows knotting. "Knowing your sense of humor, were you carrying a straight blade everywhere to be ironic?"</p>

<p>Toad eyed him endearingly. "Uh, no. You were less PC than me for once, niiiice!"</p>

<p>He lay flat again, back of his head bopping against the metal. "I'm definitely brain damaged."</p><hr />

<p>An intense rivalry span across every kingdom and the Great Sea, where at last, at near inhabitable Inception Island of Fahr Outpost, the camo-clad thirty-fiveish aged noki was worn down by the fortyish something red boo and cornered against a frigid solid rock. In all of the detective's fifteen or twenty, depending on which he was going with that day, years of experience, he'd never had a target as dangerous and persistent as Agent M, lowering the rocket launcher to smirk and display all those sharp cascading teeth.</p>

<p>"We both fabricate our age, how cute!"</p>

<p>Jelectro tilted his sunglasses to wink. "At least I don't have to, Patchy McGraybeard."</p>

<p>"Hey! Heeeey..." M rubbed his chin. "I'm doing my best and chicks dig it. Now you and Jeremy are still in the condo at so and so..? How many pieces you wanna be mailed back in?"</p>

<p>The red boo aimed the launcher again, cackling like a maniac. A mound of snow had accumulated on the barrel that quick. If the 'friendly' chat went on, Jelectro would soon be buried alive anyway. Of the rogue gallery, he found himself longing for on and off hours friend 999, or Lt. Stone. If not spike deep in Koopa Troop espionage, he could have been around, salving the unhinged as was his unusual knack. 0064 supposed he could use his own powers and it wouldn't be hedonistic for once, but evidently M was only thinking about home at Toad Town and being with some girlfriend..</p>

<p>"You are despicable, Trevor!"</p>

<p>"That's what my old therapist said! You know he prescribed me a rope, Bond?"</p>

<p>The noki mumbled some reply, trained now at something down the dark barrel, the size of his head. There was an object stuffed in, and not a bullet bill-</p>

<p>"-I know! What a quack. Chains are far better, you know, for gagging people. You'd be able to testify! Fine, FINE enough stalling-"</p>

<p>And then, the noki reached and latched onto the object, creating a backfire that blew the red boo off the cliff. The snowball containing him smacked against a cabin, sending its occupant, a bob-omb in a fur hat out to investigate. Agent M emerged before the spherical baddie, the remains of his rocket launcher in the lawn split like a banana. He decked the civilian and retrieved his backup, the SS HQ shotty, approaching the cracked up dark blue shell of a noki, surrounded by colorful fun confetti.</p>

<p>He froze for a bit, literally as well, an ill feeling building up until he was gently prodded.</p>

<p>"-Mon ami, I thought it was time to come out of my shell." Jelectro, runny nosed and in an undershirt, loaded the silenced handgun. "Last words?"</p>

<p>Agent M's lip curled. "Yeah-"</p>

<p>"No no-" He revealed the red boo's own cell phone he'd pilfered. "To your Mademoiselle-"</p>

<p>M scanned the text and cursed to himself. "I promised Bridget I was gonna be home every night from now on..."</p>

<p>The noki checked his dive watch, the dunce cap then on him. Unless he'd reset the calendar under the cyclops by accident, it was Sunday morning. "Aye aye aye. We can kill each other another day. Oui?"</p>

<p>The two scaled down in the six feet of slush, ice beating down.</p>

<p>"If you say so," Agent M breathed down his neck.</p>

<p>"That was unnecessary."</p>

<p>"It wasn't. You know this whole thing was me trying to frame the Spy Guy alliance."</p>

<p>Jelectro made him trip on purpose. "What part of me going down a canyon in your rust bucket would accomplish that, mon ami??"</p>

<p>"The part where I would phase you out and fake your assassination? It was that koopaling that mucked it up Either way, this fiasco is off the books. Us boo buddies aren't terrible secret keepers like the boo diddlys... Hey Jelectro!" He scowled as the noki jumped on a rickety ski lift in the middle of his sentence. M leapt for the sidebar, dangled for a moment to catch his breath and then sloppily spilled onto the chairlift. "Don't even try to ditch me, Bond. People that turn their back to boos never make it long.."</p>

<p>"Rules and conventions are nothing to me or you. Are not Red Boos an all female species?"</p>

<p>"Hey! ...Heeey.. Just for that you're paying the tab into town! Clear?"</p>

<p>Jelectro focused ahead only, fighting against the nosebleed coming on.. "Wrong again, Trevor. Everything is <em>opaque</em>."</p><hr />

<p>Around the fortress in Neo Bowser City, agitated volcanoes spew lava all around town, mesmerizing a toad girl in the window, pressed to the glass drapes fully drawn. Mayor Koton and his rock baddies gave her and the gang the conference room, the lounge chair, the computer, and an awesome snack machine.</p>

<p>"Emery. Uh. Emery?" A koopatrol in a pink dress suit and tie, the men's uniform companion the girl's suit of a more feminine cut, stood next to her. "That kind of thing isn't healthy for even us natives.."</p>

<p>Startled, she bumped into him, righted herself, and flashed an ok, smoke pouring from her eye sockets. "Noted."</p>

<p>"Guess this is a bad time to discuss Queen Wendy O's official statement?"</p>

<p>"No, go ahead." She smiled, trying to not look blind.</p>

<p>Tanner fiddled with his pockets. "She'd texted me it. And then my phone died forever." Looking over the old Bowserphone with a Koopa Ball Z shell cover was bittersweet. Its abrupt end flushed down a couple of old pictures he had of Zoo.</p>

<p>"Well?" She poked his hard chest.</p>

<p>"Oh. Umm, the basics are: if anyone doesn't want to support her 'fabulous dreams', reshaping the world, killing plumbers, being good looking, blah blah, expect death."</p>

<p>"How could anyone say no to that?"</p>

<p>"I know. She sounded like her old self in it too, and to be messaged directly, I must be doin' great!"</p>

<p>"I can't see that."</p>

<p>Deflating, "-Yeah, I'm just a door and pizza box guard.."</p>

<p>"No I mean-" She held his elbow, she hoped, and led him toward what she was hearing . On the surveillance screens showing downstairs, Skylandians were gathering on the Dark Land crest rug, darker skinned toads with mostly light blue spots. Decorated in armor from yesterday's battle, and running on that same high by their boldness in speaking to Johnson, they were all going to march down tomorrow to vote for Toad!</p>

<p>"Guys guys guys! Something crazy just happened!" Hippity Hop announced in the doorway after the fact. They shrieked regardless.</p>

<p>Emery found the worn, hand me down desk and sat. Funny, she despised being propped behind these when at MK East, dealing with paperwork or some drivel. Now she was willing because she saw the big picture. -Once the black dots faded from her vision she would rather. She called up Wendy on the conference phone. The distaff koopaling appeared on screen. She had an influencer angle, so she wasn't too close, showing others in the background looking gaunt and tired. As for the princess, she positively glowed, like she'd spent the night in a fancy hotel, exactly like her glamor shots, infatuating the three until her low venous tone shot them back to reality.</p>

<p>"I am aware of encroaching dangers, disciples Emery, Tanner.. And Flippity-Flop."</p>

<p>"Princess.." Hippity complained.</p>

<p>"SILENCE.. hitherto unimportant travelers- a brigade, approaches with an offering, just in time for one of our celestial enemies." Bowser Jr. stopped playing with a toy train and began to point and call her out to their dad. Wendy slid the camera closer. "So for now sit pretty! Ciao!"</p>

<p>Her disciples, or as normal people would say, her assistants nodded obsequiously.</p><hr />

<p>The cloaked figure picked up the phone in the recess of MK East, knowing the codes for the facilities intranet. </p>

<p>"Hello, this is Dr. Prof. Koopa..."</p>

<p>She abjectly fell back against the alcove wall. "..I thought this was-"</p>

<p>"Oh, girl. It is me. Mariam."</p>

<p>"You sound like <em>him</em>. "</p>

<p>On the other end, all the way in the Sarasaland processing station, the duplighost checked around carefully, remaining in their disguise. "I know dearie. I'm great at imitation. Every document has Theodore on it, there's no choice."</p>

<p>"I don't follow."</p>

<p>"Something hit our ship! The Princess Peach limped on, stars bless, but Dr. Prof was seasick and half over the rails the moment before impact. We only recovered him from the hips down!"</p>

<p>The cloaked one gasped.</p>

<p>"-Nass, why are you risking this call?"</p>

<p>She collected her thoughts, sliding up her glasses. "I've done my job. A special guess is arriving and I don't want to become trapped. We go far back. It's the King."</p>

Fly escaped the open suitcase, all that was in it. The green dinosaur
wished to the stars for a reset and he got it, already having a
banality free for once phone conversation with his ex-fianc&eacute;
for closure. She&rsquo;d tied a balloon to her problems and released
the string, per her &lsquo;elegant&rsquo; quote. The Marios could use
that advice, his short tail managing to whack into everything during
his respite stay. Ripping Poochy away from cartoons caused an
avalanche from boxes near the TV.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario shot
up from the kitchen table, leaving behind the toaster he was
repairing. &ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d shoved those Nintendo console
boxes in the closet..&rdquo; While assisting he discovered a music
box he lost a year ago, dropping the dino all over again in his
haste.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A lump on
his nose, Yoshi rescued himself ultimately. A broken up statue in the
pile stood out. &ldquo;This is why that happens, Mario!&rdquo; he
lectured heatedly. A self deprecating smile almost crept on him,
recalling the rafter in the eye parable. &ldquo;Sorry.. What was
that? Maybe we can replace it,&rdquo; he offered.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After an
enduring light speed journey through disorienting pewter colored
space dust, it was only at the impenetrable gold gates where
Millennium Star grumbled. The white fields of Eldstar&rsquo;s court
were scorched, sporadically unveiling the bare sapphire platform, and
the aqueduct of the perpetual motion machine was desertic. The
ancient star&rsquo;s omniscience allowed him a window inside the
tarnished temple:</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~Mamar and
Kalmar chat on a rear balcony, empty pie pans stacked two and three
high. Muskular was in his ground floor gym, a pan on a bench while he
lifted a dumbbell. Misstar sat at a vanity, adjusting her sun colored
silk ribbon, a partially consumed pie also reflecting along with her
stunning self. Kevlar and Skolar, distanced by rows of shelves in the
library, identically had their workspace soiled by crumbs. Eldstar
was in the hall adjacent to his room, like he&rsquo;d only made it
that far before he had to stop and tap on his pager, the flakes on
his mustache and a berry colored smudge on the side of his mouth
revealing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Millennium
Star rattled the gate. &ldquo;Absurd!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Exactly!&rdquo;
From out of the fog emerged a miniature golden star. He bowed,
explaining through his strained breaths. &ldquo;The Mario Kart
results soured my appetite, so I passed when the Absurd Apple Pies
were sent.&rdquo; Twink hovered again, his natural glow framing a
face etched with agony. &ldquo;It broke something in the Star
Spirits. They&rsquo;ve been dithering since. I saw the deliverer

I.. was actually told by the star kids I was fussing over a
coincidence.&rdquo; Twink glanced off into the cosmos emptily. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
scattered since.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Millennium
Star took his pointed arm, raising him to his level. &ldquo;Shame on
those insolents. They will be forgotten in the annals of this journey
unlike you. Steer me to the assailant!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The cosmic
clouds almost parted for the ancient star sweeping Rosalina&rsquo;s
Comet Observatory until he found the idyllic zone abandoned. The
console display was powered down, uncharacteristic of the watchful
goddess, and there was but one luma visible, waving him down.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Help!&rdquo;
A dark brown star begged, flat on the floor. &ldquo;I tried to warn
that star warrior against &lsquo;rolling up gangsta style&rsquo; on
Earth. He seized Rosalina as well, Milly. Knock some sense into him!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Coming
down, his eyebrows furrowed. &ldquo;..What did you just call me?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Polari
peeled himself up. &ldquo;-Excuse me, Millennium Star I'm so
overwrought- Oh hurry please. </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I</font></em>
<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">will become a
launch star for you.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Why
thank you..&rdquo; Millennium Star mumbled, watching Polari spin on
the spot and transform into a black colored version of that
distinctive form of star powered transportation. A sense tingled as
he stopped outside it, examining and in fact about to decline, when a
particlized tendril captured and dragged him in with crushing
gravity. He grit his teeth, the outer ring spinning rapidly
counterclockwise around him.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That&rsquo;s
what ya get for pokin &lsquo;round, Milly!&rdquo; roared the launch
star.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
was always a curious bugger, Zachary A. Star!&rdquo; he spat back.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A nerve
hit, the adversary spewed him through the universe so quickly the
fabrics of it warbled. Not concerning much to Millennium Star, the
lord of two things, one of which the Dark Ztar was running out of.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">If Mario
got away with pretending small refreshes made something original, he
could too. Without fortresses, bloodwood trees, banners, and other
works cluttering 444 Dark Drive, fresh angles were unveiled on the
swampy Badlands, the flat traditional Darklandian village, scaling
modern Neo Bowser City, and the distant rural volcano range. It could
be more appreciated if they weren&rsquo;t drained from travel and
stuck under leaking flimsy tents. Something had to be done, Bowser
recognized, if he didn&rsquo;t want to lose the tiny bit of morale
he&rsquo;d scraped up, calling for a different type of wizardry. He
was going to put on his best behavior and delegate. (Unlike those
&lsquo;lazy&rsquo; Mushroomites who got everything handed to them,
grrr.)</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Hello
caller,&rdquo; the company picked up, &ldquo;Did you hit the 1 or the
3?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...Hello?
Yeah, this is Bowser!!&rdquo; he blew the speaker out, covering his
mouth afterward. &ldquo;None.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">..</font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So
it defaults to three. Noted,</font></em>&rdquo; <font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It
was a gravelly Mushroom accented voice. &ldquo; &hellip;.Thank you
for calling 'Authentic Restorations and Replicas Inc.&rsquo; This is
Mr. X speaking and, unfortunately, how may I help you?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Who asked
for that sass? Bowser held his rebuttal. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve returned
to Dark Land and I would like to order a copy of my castle. Don&rsquo;t
worry, I won&rsquo;t illegally rip off the REPLICA stickers.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Your
slaves can&rsquo;t build for you?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No,
LOSER- Erm. My point is if I hired minions to do it, which means I
pay extra by the way, it&rsquo;s just as much my goal to keep the few
folks willing to support me from getting hypothermia!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">..I&rsquo;m
sorry I wasn&rsquo;t keeping up. When did that change?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Like..
I dunno.&rdquo; Bowser checked around the alleyways of the camp,
cupping over the speaker. &ldquo;Years back. Yeah. Not too long
after.. My marriage end. Is that even your business? What, need a
background check? I have the money. You in or out??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sure,
sure. Send to here..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">While
using a dry tree stump to write on, Bowser found it quaint that
someone was that out of touch with the biggest menace in the Mushroom
World. X really didn&rsquo;t get out. Shortly he had the checks
filled, his large handwriting requiring multiple to hold the zeros.
Runner minions came up, including a paragoomba in a pink officer's
cap. After having the check containing the important decimal point
slapped in his face, he shook it off.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">This
is Hippity Hop sir, 13th aerial forces. I think Queen Wendy O. wanted
me to escort her into the city.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Bowser
parted through the Koopa Troop until he brought his only daughter to
the front by the shell. &ldquo;You are grounded and you CANNOT go
downtown with all the malls until that election tomorrow. I&rsquo;m
sick of this craziness. Know what? I don&rsquo;t want ANYONE by
Hippityface going back right now..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
pouted. &ldquo;Daddy...&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Enough!
Who volunteers to guard the path so nobody sneaks off???&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Like he&rsquo;d
proposed a raise, there were goombas, bob-ombs, shy guys, heck even
Morton rallying until Ludwig tapped him. A drone of unaffiliated
airships filled the turbulent skies.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Four
carried over the KT camp a huge structure, releasing the cables over
the castle plot. Bowser and others unearthed from the tidal wave of
mud, blindly crawling in the direction of impact. Only when Kammy
bumped Kamek into the moat did it click for the less sophomoric.
Compact, boxy, non-self indulgent and with relatively low towers, it
featured a parasitic fortress that was once Larry&rsquo;s, and a neon
board screaming BOWSER that was in fashion during the Dinosaur Land
takeover era.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Consequently
the Koopa King dragged his feet across the drawbridge, the others
overtaking him to disperse happily. After some used that BACK DOOR
however, he recalled that this was Mario&rsquo;s favorite design in
the day. He was just so dang athletic if he wanted to be...</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Settle
down, your viciousness. You seem smitten. Should I call a medic?&rdquo;
A crone blocked his path.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
soot-covered magikoopa shoved her aside. &ldquo;Lord Bowser would
rather not when we already owe this.&rdquo; Kamek handed the
flustered Koopa King the MKDCU bill.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">WHAT???&rdquo;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daisy,
I&rsquo;m delighted you&rsquo;re delighted of the progress so far!.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Didn't
mean to holla. Sorry.&rdquo; Daisy squeezed her tight under the
arched lattice entrance into the newly renovated garden. The blonde
princess ignored how crumpled her fancier more exaggerated dress was
getting. She also had ringlets in her hair, new opera gloves and pink
shined heels. As long as Daisy didn&rsquo;t mess any of that up,
she&rsquo;d be able to shape herself back up for later.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daisy
scoped Joseph's maze, hands on hips. &ldquo;Wow.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There&rsquo;s
a developer's exit to skip-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Where&rsquo;s
the fun in that? Come on.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The tanned
princess led her, hand in hand, through the leafy zig zags, at one
point passing right by the gardener without recognition. As they
hadn't gotten together in a while, Peach remembered how much she
admired Daisy's super power. In addition to how she attracted
Flutters, made buds on potted plants open, withered hedges flower,
and the parched ground green, she could amble with messy shoulder
length hair, an orange hoodie, blue track pants, and tennis shoes and
be treated 'normally'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Spray from
the waterfall released Peach from that tangent. They'd reached the
clearing at the end, a tranquil spring setting yards from the river.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;How'd
I do without a map?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;..Wonderful,
dear!&quot; Peach worked through her off kilter feeling to show her
to the metal table and chairs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A steward
materialized on the spot, sliding the chairs out and setting the
table expertly in five seconds, with tea in cups. Everything was
easing back into what Peach envisioned for this 'business meeting',
until the auburn haired princess leaned way back in the 19th century
bedizened chair like it was some ratty old recliner, her long bronze
legs stretching beyond where Peach's were. Peach glanced to Toadette
and back, flushing, and said nothing, trying not to stare. Thusly the
toad girl persisted with the 'script'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She pulled
out a violin and a bow, screeching one note before Peach stopped her.
&quot;Wrong mood we're going for, dear. It's a tea party with Daisy,
not..&quot; She whispered, &quot;When Mario and I would do this!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
sheepishly lowered the vintage instrument. &quot;Princess, your CD
with the ambient bird sounds is misplaced.&quot;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><b>I
know where to find another!!</b></font>&rdquo; <font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
gigantic three-headed monster sprung out of the joining lake.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">While the
blonde princess hid behind a paper fan, Daisy shielded the sun, eager
to see the kaiju sweep around Toad Town with his bat wings, cries of
confusion or terror resonating out there. &quot;That's wicked!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
stared off dreamily. &quot;Blue has really glowed up. I love the
confidence, the fire breath, how he wears a size 500 shoe &hellip;Enjoy
the tea!&quot; She inched away from that TMI admission, replaced with
a taller heavyset purple toad.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Les
chatted up Daisy. Unfortunately for her or him, it was enigmatic to
Peach either way, she knew the discography of the band on her shirt
better than he did, as she was more into 'metal' and he into 'rock'.
Joseph swung in, dropping some fire and ice flowers on their table as
his excuse to intrude. That didn't last however, Daisy not knowing
ASL. As more toads spontaneously realized that another princess was
on their property, Chef Tim informed them of cupcakes in the oven,
though he blabbed so long he suddenly had to sprint away to put out a
small fire. A shy kid, Thomas came up with the CD over his finger,
but no player to use it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;We're
going to have to proceed without some accommodations, I'm afraid.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daisy
shrugged and laughed in response. &quot;Great. It's sorta awkward to
go all out when this is nothing.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
abruptly sat down her emptied tiny ceramic cup. &quot;This was an act
of war against your kingdom too!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Nah.&quot;
She patted the pink princess's poofy sleeves. &quot;I bet they didn't
even know who I was in all this mess. I'm fine, and if I get home
before tomorrow I won't get chewed tf out.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh.&quot;
Peach didn't know how to react, especially when Daisy sat straight,
somewhat serious faced.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Peach,
besides restitution, what else do you want to talk about?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Unable to
look into the other princess's deep blue eyes, she pretended the
waterfall she'd seen all her life was exceptionally interesting right
then. &quot;My father will have some very valid matters to question
me on today. I can't keep peace. I keep needing assistance. I'm not
engaged yet! It makes the way I took over haunt me again, because
after all that, I'm still failing.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daisy's
hands covered over her wrists as she wavered. &quot;Straight up. I
know your story and all that, so was sending him out of town the
right choice?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
gathered the courage to face her. &quot;Yes.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She handed
over a red and white checkered keffiyeh she'd packed. &quot;K. Put
that on. It's important. Now road trip!!!!!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
found herself basking in the sights, smells, and sensations of
typical life, no agents of her father ruining it with tanks. The
strict classes she grew up with were vanquished, toads, koopas, other
'friendly' and 'enemy' species alike bustling around Toad Town.
Together, without a steward or guide, they could do whatever. They
window shopped, visited important landmarks like the coliseum, busy
with helping Mushroom Flu patients in the wide space, and tried out
questionable or odd items sold on the street, like a 'never-melt'
snow bunny that did just that all over the place. During the last
fifteen minutes of 'BUZZY: The Movie' at the one coin theater, they
were asked to leave, because Daisy kept sharing far more entertaining
memes on her phone. An attendant caught Peach's identity once in the
lobby and prostrated, but she let the decision stand. This was all so
unprincess like, yet invigorating, even when they almost died on the
way back to the castle.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Okay a
truck- almost- by accident surely, splashed them from a puddle, but
still! No hysterics. No one hurled their body in the way to block it,
nothing. It was as clear as the lake in the center of Royal Raceway
that she needed to fix her perspective.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;So
we learned...&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
didn't answer quickly enough she supposed, Daisy shaking her
playfully. &quot;In a theater, don't operate-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Besides
that!&quot; she laughed. &quot;You've done more than any Toadstool
ever, girl. That's what. They feel safe here, dedicate their lives to
it, fight for it.. The King had better be proud!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A tear
she'd been holding in rolled. &quot;Yes. He should.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daisy
handed her something. After accepting, she realized it was a
sweatband. &quot;Umm.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;It's
clean! Now lemme teach ya about going nuclear.&quot; She sat on the
concrete barrier.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Though the
flawless condition of her dress flashed in Peach's mind, whatever the
Sarasalandian had to say somehow became more tantalizing, and she
joined her. &quot;What does that entail?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Remember
when nothing was going on for a while? Back home artifacts were
making pyramids fly, possessing folks, causing plagues-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach was
inadvertently squeezing the tan princess's freckled forearm.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
know. I excavated bout fifty plots, including my own backyard, and
the catch was to gather them up. With the conflict, we could blow the
suckers sky high. So it's literal.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;...Is
it that simple? Thank you, by the way.&quot; She awkwardly returned
the sweatband.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No
prob, and yep, it is. Thanks for listening to my Ted Talk.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;What?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yeah,
nothin..&quot; Daisy stared intensely, leaning in. &quot;Peach, I
dunno if it's your perfect race track backdrop, the waters
reflectin', or the darker colors of your dress, but your eyes are SO
effin blue right now. Like more than the beautiful Great Sea.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The blonde
princess blushed. If.. if only she wasn't complementing contacts.
&quot;I'm not used to head coverings. Yes.. and I'm a little dizzy.
Let's get out of the heat,&quot; she sputtered, climbing up.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daisy
rose, visibly disappointed. &quot;Not stopping those racers. Just
sayin'.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A silver
Aston Mushroom drifted around the curve leading to the starting line,
braking aggressively in front of them. The window lowered. &ldquo;Princess!
Yoohoo! Could I ask a few things?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
Koopa, famed reporter, jumped out. The way her pen hovered over the
notepad made Peach&rsquo;s stomach twirl- or in a bad way now rather.
Her first instinct was to skip out of there until a poke in her back
made her leap forward almost into her.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
got this!&rdquo; Daisy winked, moving off to blend in with some road
workers in the background.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
fired questions, basic ones the princess always got post rescue. The
only new detail was that &lsquo;toad destroyer&rsquo; Boo was
arrested. Lo and behold, her friend called it. Nothing to be afraid
of. Kylie finished jotting and, like something pinged her, glanced
over her shell and back.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">One
sec.&rdquo; Kylie hopped in, started that kart and made a U-turn so
that the passenger side was stationed at Peach.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She gasped
as it rolled down and a toad she had a long history with flashed a
white smile.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;m
a quarter mile from your castle, so this is permissible right? Got
one question..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
struggled to not eyeroll. He was banned from her home, not
specifically from herself, quite and oversight to realize now. The
green toad had crinkles and since last seeing him, but with that
strong deep voice for a toad and decent male fashion sense, it was
undeniably Mitch Toad. &ldquo;You may proceed.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
leaned into view. &ldquo;I might be recording this too. Just for
backup.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Stuff
it..&rdquo; Mitch shoved her face out of the way. &quot;A suitor, the
richest guy in town is interested in ya, and he&rsquo;s the one that
rebuilt your castle!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Interview
over-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mitch
flipped his notebook like some luxurious game show prize, pink
official parchment with a perfect forgery of 'THE KING'. &ldquo;-And
he&rsquo;s right here! ...Oh you think you're safe because I can't
hop out? That doesn't stop me anymore&rdquo; With a loud crack, the
raised dash panel section of her raceway crumbled, terrifying nearby
workers. &ldquo;Now eyes back to me. As king I'd show the cretins
round here what fair society looks like, unlike-&rdquo; He covered
his mouth scandalously. &ldquo;</font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
contents of that parcel you&rsquo;re hiding.</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">.
&rsquo;ve already predicted every move of yours. Give it up. Marry
me.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-You
got some nerve talking smack to her.&rdquo; Daisy popped up,
snatching the toad by the necktie.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Then a
door was kicked shut by the irate pink shelled koopa storming out.
&quot;If you're trying to gather a harem, forget about helping me
with this Nass T. case!&quot;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Whatever,&rdquo;
he snorted to her. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know &lsquo;Peachy&rsquo;
as much as ya think, Daisy. How&rsquo;s she gonna explain who rebuilt
the caste? Why she&rsquo;s wearing colored contacts? Why she won&rsquo;t
be engaged when she&rsquo;s embellished to her dad she was?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daisy
stepped back from the sports car, unreadably. &ldquo;No lies told,
dawg!&rdquo; She drew closer to Peach. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s&hellip;
with me.&rdquo; Slapping Peach&rsquo;s behind with apparently an
authentic enough reaction in return, applause and whistling erupted
out of nowhere.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Color
draining, Peach whipped left and right. Pianta, monty, and toads in
hardhats lined the sides, Kylie, not quite out of ear range spinning
on her heels, gawking.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A taped
recipe slid from under Chancellor Samuel Toadsworth&rsquo;s red door,
bunching against Toadette&rsquo;s shoe. He&rsquo;d scrutinized it at
least she hoped, he tried to destroy it decades ago after all,
because as dutiful as she was, smothering himself in that room was
derisive at his point. Before she went ham, she saw words on the
other side, his written reply. That wasn&rsquo;t the etiquette for..
She&rsquo;d reluctantly accept that for now, running late. She darted
downstairs, beyond Mr. Zeror digging in a supply closet, and took
some keys off a hook. She got to drive a car unattended, brightening
her mood considerably. See, flooding the Birthday Kart like a klutz
sent it to a shop, and in an ironic way now, what was one of Peach&rsquo;s
newest assets pre-castle destruction now fit in better with the
surviving relics sealed in the basement. She rolled it out into the
driveway-</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette!&rdquo;
The frenzied princess clung to the side of the kart, scaring the
daylights out of her. &ldquo;We must stop the presses, the message
boards, and the gossip of the Toad Town public transportation. -Or,&rdquo;
Peach beamed, like she had the most brilliant idea then. &ldquo;I
need an invention that reverses time!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daisy
rested her foot on the bumper, less traumatized but breathing as
heavily from the mad dash. &ldquo;Maybe I can work on that last one.
I see the sunscreen, the sunglasses. Head&rsquo;n down South?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
nodded, dumbstruck.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Good.
Btw Peachy and I are engaged until then.&rdquo;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It
ain&rsquo;t working out,&rdquo; Roy wagged fingers in the face of the
Koopa Troop general gazing endlessly into the overcast. &ldquo;Face
it, Luddy. She&rsquo;s just not dat into yer meetings.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A thorough
sweep of the graveyard of upturned and nonairworthy airships behind
Bowser&rsquo;s New Castle did not unveil Wendy or Larry, mirroring
the previous meeting. &ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; Ludwig grunted, settling on
what crowd he did have, a dozen assorted baddies, not counting
siblings.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">All
attention on him, woozy with a thick scarf he&rsquo;d never be caught
in normally hiding &lsquo;influenza&rsquo; sores, in reality an
unsubstantiated side effect from the Gravitational Pull, he shattered
on the spot, his knees buckling.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-IT&rsquo;S
NOT FINE!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A rainbow
haired koopaling detached from the others who had never seen that
part of their commander before, followed by a taller one with a green
half shave.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After
we acquire the Special Object, how can we keep it safe?? I cannot
believe I am doubting myself,&rdquo; he wept onto Lemmy as he patted
his shell comfortingly. Iggy's arms were out stretched and he totally
didn't go for him. He knew Lemmy was the Bish&#333;nen between them,
but what the heck..</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We&rsquo;re
this close despite all that, though! Now we can ALL fight the dark
star! We don&rsquo;t even care that we can die!... Welp, I
coulda..reworded that...&rdquo; Lemmy watched Davey the whomp, Claude
the albatoss, Annabell the pom pom, and other minions whose names
only he knew scurry.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After a
grateful nod of acknowledgement to his &lsquo;trusted adjutant&rsquo;,
oh and that other one, Ludwig obtained his equilibrium. &ldquo;You
are correct. I should appreciate what I have.&rdquo; He squinted at
the bony beetle doubling back.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sup,&rdquo;
Leo greeted. &ldquo;My cousin just texted me that Miss Wendy uh..
Left Bowser&rsquo;s New Castle on an errand, clack clack.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">But
it is integral that we monitor her!!!&rdquo; Ludwig demanded. &ldquo;The
Jewel of the Stars, WW63 relic is somewhere in Mayor Koton&rsquo;s
office. &lsquo;Parallelogon&rsquo; belongs outside her clutches.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ooh!
I can track her with my &lsquo;Way Awesome Intelligent Futuristic
Utility&rsquo;!!&rdquo; Iggy Delta bounced around, waving for
attention. &quot;Lemmy, would you like for me to show you my super
cool abilities?&quot;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;d
like it but..&rdquo; Lemmy struggled for a second,
uncharacteristically.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He&rsquo;ll
wuss out anyway! Bawk bawk bawk!&rdquo; Roy sneered, overdoing it
blatantly to Ludwig. He was apprehensive himself!</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Knock
it off! I&rsquo;m Super Mercenary Iggy Delta now, cybernetically
enhanced koopaling soon to get at least a two season anime and a
finale episode! Or a manga volume, I&rsquo;d take that too if any
publishers are listening-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
must vouch for Iggster.&rdquo; Morton was given a bizarre once over
from Roy but he continued, from the safety of standing behind Ludwig.
&ldquo;My bookclub is raving about his tech services saying he did
not budge, capitulate, or back down when they wanted a discount.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Junior
paused his playing with a toy train. &ldquo;Can I get an opinion?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Nope,&rdquo;
they unanimously answered..</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
rubbed his chin. He observed how Neo Bowser City had a bright halo,
befitting of how it was his salvation. The end of this was nigh
assuming Toadsworth, kingdoms away pulled his weight. The next page
for him? Likely sending postcards to his friends- no scratch that,
his family only from the Overthere.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
shall go Ignatius,&rdquo; he decided, just in time for the dinner
call. Roy made a dangerous &lsquo;I see you&rsquo; gesture to Morton,
Junior was still ignored and Iggy was the last remaining outdoors,
despondently soaking in the rain&hellip;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;How
wonderful for you sartorially immaculate gentlemen to drop in!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The roof
folded under the weight of their hostages and dumped them in the
middle row, The Captain amused while Banktoad, also in the front,
sunk out of view from embarrassment.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The blue
geeky toad secured a sleeve of the stylish plumber. &quot;Did you
know the average toad has 2.5 times the strength of a human?-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
swung his leg up and kicked Hint Toad across that cheeky face. &quot;No
average human here, bucko.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
unconscious spectacled adventurer slumped into the lap of Mailtoad.
He jut his arms up in surrender, as Toad already had a blade to his
neck.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Stop
this thing, or paperboy gets it!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Captain
tapped the wheel, thinking it over with no urgency, oblivious to
Mailtoad pleading for his life.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Banktoad
had enough. &quot;Here! Take this in exchange!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
clumsily caught the tossed backward Vrlrdyi Scope.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;William!&quot;
The Captain pinched his nephew's ear and they fought in the front row
like animals, the serving, tilting vehicle jumbling Toad and Luigi
around without seatbelts.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Like a lit
bob-omb went off, &quot;I HATE YOU STANLEY YOU STUPID BISH! STOP
MAKING EVERYTHING HELL FOR US AND STOP THE CAR! !!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Captain
Toad mashed the brakes, sand flying, before they careened into the
ocean. Luigi and Toad smacked against the back of their seat and
bounced off, dazed. &quot;William, watch your language,&quot; he
hissed, fingers quivering over the wheel. &quot;I regret ever
approaching you while you were down, bestowing an irregular a
lucrative career and- How did this wonderous bridge get here?&quot;
He pointed to the rainbow road sprawling from the island.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bank
settled back into his seat, breathing heavily. &quot;(I freaking
heard that you..) Yeah, I did that with the telescope thing.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His palm
slid onto his left thigh. &quot;William, you are simply spectacular!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yeah.
Sure.&quot; Banktoad distantly dropped that tuft of hair he'd pulled
from The Captain. &quot;And I'm sorry.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Me
too. May we proceed?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Huh?
Uh. Y-yeah I guess-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
Captain stomped the accelerator a fraction of a second before the
hostages regained their bearings. The steepness and speed going up
that newly formed ramp flung them into the wagon's rear cabin,
colliding with glass bottles with a tremendous clang as the sirens
and lights caught up.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
Captain adjusted a mirror. &quot;Who knew pigs could fly?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Pull
over!&quot; buzzed from the hovering space cruiser. Several warnings
later, it unleashed super scope blasts, turning the kart into swiss
cheese. A door latch was blown off, ejecting everything and everyone
in the trunk. The plumber, toad, and bottles slammed the solid ground
of the connected island.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The next
thing Luigi remembered was being numb all over, spitting up grit
while on his knees and elbows. Toad, disguised as a lump of mud to
his side, or the other way around, gave a sign he was a-okay,
rewarded for lying obviously when a blur buried him deeper in sand as
it came across. The airtight hatch clicked, released steam, and
lifted upwards.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Give
it your all, Delta,&quot; Snifit Patrol cryptically spoke into his
radio.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi's
head stopped spinning from whatever that was. &quot;Officer-
we..Who..?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Have
no fear Mr. Luigi, I will arrest the scum of the Earth who inverted
all of your pockets-&quot; (Stunned, the men then noticed their coats
and pants like that) &quot;-Crossed seven kingdoms illegally, and
kidnapped you! Now let's kick it.&quot; He plucked the toad right up,
like the vegetables in Subcon.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Thanks,
Sumeet..&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad's
expression remained brittle through the invite inside the cruiser.
This entire time he was worried about encountering someone that knew
him while he was obviously on a date, when the real danger was
another red toad who's known his secret for ages now. As much as that
sucked, this patrol car's intense, rocket like ride made up for it.
There were more vibrant rainbows bridging islands, red and green
cheep cheeps leaping out of the water underneath in choreographed
formations, and they saw it all up close.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;This
is a phenomenal metaphysical projecting device.&quot; The green
plumber geeked out over the Vrlrdyi Scope, eighteen inches by
estimate, very light, non-telescoping, and inscribed around the
barrel in a spidery language. &quot;How does it know what to cast?
Might it be sapient? Does it read nerve endings? Can I find a manual
somewhere?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
laughed weakly, easing up. &quot;Just find out.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well, he
didn't expect Luigi to aim the telescope in his face.</font></p>

to an abrupt stop with his tractor beam. &quot;It's not kawaii
Wendy-chan, and it made everybody leave our Princess Parlor discord.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
crossed one leg over the other. &quot;I'm not! I'm vibing in my salt
water element. Rumors of me attacking Toad was a tarp. I'd rather
talk to him.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The canoe
rocked when he skeptically sat on the other end. &quot;You got some
explaining to do sis. I sorta hyped up that I'd have an epic battle
with you. Besides I thought you were like King Dad. You don't like
toads and hate twilight?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yes.
That franchise deserves to be flamed!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;And
you think MayMay is stuck in 2008..&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His
chiseled undershell made her fist rebound. 'Yowch!' She had to dip
her knuckles in the water to hide the pain, nonetheless proud he'd
toughened up &quot;Here's why I'm like shook, Iggy. I've already
triple crossed the line, but I gotta keep going to contrast Luddy.
I'm not misanthropic like him, I do love people, if they listen to me
at least.. so I wanted to take the KT and focus on 'us', our
wellbeing, because that's gone by the wayside and we all know it.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
twiddled his thumbs. &quot;Entirely so, Wendy-chan. The more of the
outside world I analyze with my sensors, the less I can ignore that
my talents are kinda underutilized here. Plus I think Lemmy dumped me
as his BFF. I've teleported five hundred times now and no amount of
coding or doing tech support calls fills the void. We have a
predicament don't we?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Gosh,
somebody gets it.&quot; She wrinkled her nose as this huge ocean
liner came up, a senior oriented one with no amusement to be found,
with the audacity to honk like they were in the way. She flung a ring
at it, striking the hull and it didn't even sink like what the movie
'Toadtanic' taught her. &quot;Brought headphones to drown that drab
thing out?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy
rotated the small plastic square case in his paw, reminded of who it
came from.. If these dark stars entities could use up someone in a
day or two, he had to sever their hold on sister. &quot;Right here
sis. It's playing.. 'I need 'A Doctor Mario'. Yikes, Dr. Greg got hit
by a missile yesterday. Larry doesn't like to talk about it.&quot;</font></p>

AND TUBULAR!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Her
appendages roved on their own, taking the left piece. There was a
jounce in the ocean princess as, eyes widened, she swiftly snatched
the right earphone and inserted his. They partied and jammed from the
harmony, all previous concerns abolished, even as the boat tipped on
them.</font></p>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">From the
vile and corrosive circumfluous byproduct of the wretched washed up a
purple star. Millennium Star strenuously crawled to higher parts of
the meteor rock where the dark matter pools could not reach, over
scattered fresh bones, around larger drier ones embedded in the
ground, and dodging blackening debris piles, mostly a conglomerate of
&lsquo;borrowed&rsquo; Earth soil, but with the pungent odor of death
and the source of the trails of some festering liquid. Had his very
very distant friends plunged as well? Pinned under the weight of
those worries, he fell flat, his glow revealing every sordid detail
of the crumbling graveyard he&rsquo;d encroached. Right in his
vantage point was a message chiseled in the rock-</font></p>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
Zoo, now get out like Rosalina and &#9825;&#9834;!?, however you say

a launch star or something on the other side of that morgue. A real
one.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Join

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah
no...You know they said &lsquo;Zoo, you made a good call not coming
back, &lsquo;cause you&rsquo;re stone cold crazy.&rsquo; Best
compliment I&rsquo;ve ever heard,&rdquo; he laughed dryly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Millennium
Star shifted closer, concerned. &ldquo;Don't you miss your family?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The dark
boo&rsquo;s jaw tightened, forgetting he was already backed up
against an object. &ldquo;No!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
are you holding then?&rdquo;</font></p>

will not need them.&rdquo; Millennium Star projected his Book of
Casualty, a window into the past. The open middle page showed Dr.
Toad swamped with study notes, wearing those sweaters, long sleeves,
and khaki pants he frequented to hide his &lsquo;tribal&rsquo; marks
from hybrid boo lineage and blend in with red toads at Mushroom
College.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His
brother discovered Zoo&rsquo;s &lsquo;Death Ray&rsquo; made breaks in
DNA cells in scientific terms, akin to radiation, and with that
understanding he sought to repurpose it benevolently, or perhaps
defensively. Anything but what it was then with his dark boo brother
maiming or killing people randomly. Zoo felt a stab in his chest
recalling his reaction to that discussion later, how on reflex, like
scratching an itch, he ventured into his head. He didn&rsquo;t want
to be dissected like some experiment. Fleeing to their parents was no
better. Lou deteriorated back home, forgetting names of his children,
who was older or younger, etc, and Sue Sr., the toad parent was
consumed with caregiving. Afraid of abandonment, Zoo took the first
steps and high tailed on his own-</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Freakin

underneath him. &ldquo;Like, whatever anyway. Airship&rsquo;s
sailed.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Millennium
Star dissipated the illusions. &ldquo;Your brother risked the empire
he built to respond to your letter. Your old commander has acquitted
you of the Special Object ordeal. Tanner is reminiscing about you
perpetually and, despite his efforts to honor your wish, I will
&lsquo;cheat&rsquo; and foresee that.. Ah yes. Your vote for-&rdquo;
A smile overtook him. &ldquo;Ho ho, you improved your literacy for
him. How.. sweet. Well, the only hole you cannot dig out of is the

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-And
that is why I am not one of those auspicious heroes with axioms of

the ground hard, shaking the planetoid and the abominable mounds,

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">In
Bowser&rsquo;s New Castle, the buzzing neon sign and squeaks of
minion shoes as they settled down was the only sound outside of
distant thunder claps.</font></p>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Spotted
all along, the supernaturally bleached white haired koopaling stepped
from behind the corner, pissed. At least they weren&rsquo;t snitches.

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Eek!&rdquo;
The fifteen year old crept through. Bowser&rsquo;s throne, actually
an office chair, was against the back wall, stacks of chests to the
right, a poster of Mario doing a V sign on the left, and then an
actual desk before him with a laptop. Plans and blueprints were
stacked, verging on messily, but decent by his standards. Bowser
lifted from his latest plan, chair compressing from his weight shift.
&ldquo;K?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
approached the desk, staring at his toes. &ldquo;Umm.. So Luddy was
obsessed with those Council of Conscientious Villainy hipsters and
in, umm, in their archives the motto &lsquo;Take a slice of their
pie&rsquo; came from, they claim I mean&hellip;your brother.&rdquo;
He dared to look at his father head on. Bowser was picture still.
&ldquo;Sounds like tycoon stuff. So why do you think a guy like that
woulda been better leadin us?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The king
sighed and laughed simultaneously, relaxing. &ldquo;Growing up,
Clarentine was always running off while I was homebodied. Yeah, you&rsquo;d
never guess. Then the war started and never.. Stopped in a way.&rdquo;
He coughed the raggedness out of his voice, tossing the silver pen
into the #1 villain coffee mug. &ldquo;-Er, in retrospect, King
Morton saw the writing on the wall and one of us two had to keep this
thang going..&rdquo; He typed clunkily for a sec, then swiveled the
laptop around.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
artistic reproduction might have been discussed in a freshman class
of Larry&rsquo;s. He&rsquo;d know for sure if he wasn&rsquo;t

Bowser rolled the chair, facing a window battered heavily by rain.
Lighting flashed miles off, volcanos revealed in silhouette. &ldquo;Erm,
so it was time for dad to judge. Couldn&rsquo;t be in person. He was
already hafin ta run. I copied dad in my half of the territory, and
Clarentine, oh boy.. He had traders comin in and out, fixed the ph
balance to farm and set up a monopoly thing, the goal to literally
buy our enemies out. Was never going to work, not cause we were too
stupid even though we probably were, but he just wasn&rsquo;t ready
himself to do things different. Clarentine wept and scrammed. I won
by default.&rdquo; Bowser decided that he should tug that lever to
raise the chair, so he wasn&rsquo;t sunk to the floor. &ldquo;Whenever
I&rsquo;d fail I&rsquo;d fall back in time. Wonder if he was right..
So Lawrence.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
signed a document, his hunched posture obscuring the glistening in
his eyes. &ldquo;Whether you stick with the Troop, or go off and play
music, I&rsquo;m fine with either at this point, don&rsquo;t leave
question marks in your life.&rdquo;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Where
will you go?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
will find out later!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Why
do I have a hunch already?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Because
we&rsquo;ve been acquainted for- hmm?...&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
get it, Yosh, haha.&rdquo; The red plumber locked up the screen door
under the hot sun. What good it did when his home had been busted
into twice in one weekend, he was uncertain. It was a habit is all he
supposed, like it was for his long time dinosaur friend to leash his
dog outside when he knew such measures were a suggestion at best.
Mario had a heavy duty garbage bag over his shoulders, the bust
pieces inside going to Russ T. (Yoshi&rsquo;s suggestion, very
proudly) for consultation. &ldquo;Happy house hunting!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wherever
Yoshi was looking, Mario suspected it wouldn&rsquo;t be far.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi went
tch. He could not predict him! It was only a coincidence Pleasant
Path was scenic, the sidewalks so smooth, the planters brimming with
flowering plants delectable to his large nose. The blue mushroom home
with the lights off was Gill T.&rsquo;s abode, who thought he was
neighborhood watch. The Kuribo shoe styled one belonged to Dr.
Fungenstein, a frizzy haired retired researcher who cackled into
stormy nights and badmouthed his brother from Rogueport. Others were
red toads mostly and they were unique certainly, Yoshi just had other
priorities...</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oof!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Excuse
me buddy!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dragging
himself up, Yoshi recognized the teal shell and called him back.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Apologizes,
Mr. Munchakoopas. Catch!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The dino
caught the lightweight box. &ldquo;Thank-&rdquo; He read the label,
mouth hanging. &ldquo;-You?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
to Peach castle-&rdquo; The mailman tapped rapidly into a scanner. "I wasn't being followed or had trouble visiting there or anything. I'm only five-hundred letters late on this scorcher of a day. That's all.." He saluted nervously. "Thank you for using Toad Town Postl!"</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~&rsquo;The
Fabulous Birdo&rsquo;, a heart drawn around the inscription, sending
gifts to &lsquo;Mr. Toad&rsquo;.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">At the
other end of the avenue, Mario sat on a toad proportioned wooden
stool, listening to the local personality, now out of the spotlight
since his shtick was rendered neolithic by online message boards. No
less spirited, however. Russ T. kept his space dignified and shelves
of books tidy despite signs of heavy use. He knew more about
Darklandian customs that Mario thought he did, or maybe until now
he'd never asked. All was well until he mentioned those attacks on
toads yesterday.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
ran up to the dinosaur waiting on his porch. &quot;Did Luigi mention
when he'd return? It's about Boo.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No
he didn't Mario, and-&quot; Yoshi watched Mario check that package
out. He should have hid it, because with a steamy breath, Mario's
grip crushed a corner of it. &quot;Oh that. Umm, scandalous, isn't
it?..&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;If
Toad is swooping in on your old girl like that, it's beyond that!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah,
except that's platonic, Yoshi screamed inside!</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Years ago
after he splurged on a Parade Cart, he and Birdo made gratuitous
trips anywhere around the kingdom (also the reason that didn't last).
Visiting some club, 'Chimera', they stumbled upon Toad in the back.
He was horrified at the sight of them, to the point of gagging.
Judging by the speed dating cards he dropped on the way out, he had a
specific type and it wasn't pink dinosaurs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-So, with
that in mind, he decided it was safer to keep Mario on that road.
Adopting indignation suddenly, he punted the box away, a touch too
hard. It hurled across the street, deflected off a metal mail
receptacle, bumped off a passing kart, and crashed into somebody's
window.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;&hellip;Now
you have an excuse to meet a semi-new neighbor!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
trudged to their doorstep and knocking, noticed a mangled fingerprint
keypad attached to a jiggling handle.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Sir
or ma'am, I must apologize for-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It swung
open less than an inch, the interior dark, unleashing the rasp of a
toad, &quot;Relax. I have insurance&hellip; &hellip; &hellip;! -&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A strollin
stu revved up an ear splittingly loud weed whacker next door.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hold
on.. What does that groundskeeper look like?&quot; the homeowner
repeated, undecipherable to Yoshi. At the same time, a magnificent
glider swept across the sky, the pilot blending into the black
triangle above. The tail flowing behind it spelled 'G-O-A-W-A-Y!'</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi fell
into their home, flopping back onto the hardwood. There were scraping
sounds and the natural light was blocked. Abducted, and by- He gasped
leaning up, spots in his vision from the change in lighting. The room
was chock full of spy equipment, racks of weapons, radars, and
monitors, the only thing that should belong the couch in front of a
NES Classic equipped TV. SMB3 was paused in world 3.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sonny..&rdquo;
Yoshi caught his breath. &ldquo;Ugh. Not how I thought we&rsquo;d
rendezvous.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Me
neither, Mr. Munchakoopas. I&rsquo;ve been here for eight months and
we&rsquo;d met before the coast guard thing. I didn&rsquo;t expect
you to pick up on it because I was an unremarkable red toad on
purpose.&rdquo; The nineteen year old secured bolt locks from the top
to the bottom, ammo steadily spilling from his tactile vest with
every movement. His left foot was in a homemade cast and an ugly deep
scar split across what once movie star perfect visage. &ldquo;Think
this&rsquo;ll hold?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ah,
well, Mario is less than fifty feet away.&rdquo; Yoshi got a better
look around. Pinup posters of koopa &lsquo;thots&rsquo; were
plastered behind the work stuff, some risqu&eacute;, and bookshelf
current blocked the window he&rsquo;d damaged. (Said books E-rated,
Phew) &ldquo;We should call him.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
really shouldn&rsquo;t. I got it. I so have this under control. Ha ha
ha!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
swept him away by that too big vest. &ldquo;This is serious Emerson!
There are no old bold pilots, or coast guards, or spies, whatever you
are, so get it together and stop being reckless!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
know!&rdquo; He limped around his room, clutching at both sides of
his red capped head. &ldquo;That might of been a manic episode.
Sorry. My HQ is in shambles and what&rsquo;s left of it&rsquo;s
trying to kill me over a boatload of coincidences, misunderstandings,
and our Spy Captain having an unscheduled lobotomy this morning.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi saw
another version of himself, softening. &ldquo;Okay, wait. I&rsquo;m
involved now anyway, so from the top.&rdquo; He retrieved the package
from the shards. &ldquo;Was this the impetus of the hit on you?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Correct
Anti-Guy wants that. He and Charles probably intercepted the mail
services and tracked the package into town. I&rsquo;m not sure how
you got it, the mail guy sounds lenient, but yeah. Therein lies the
problem with the telephone game and a chain of spies.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He ripped
the package open in front of him. A golden Phantoe Mask fell to the
floor with the scrap.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
prop of Birdo&rsquo;s&rdquo; he breathed.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
really? Cool. But it&rsquo;s not the Bronze Egg they were assuming it
was.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There was
a huge bang, loud as an explosion at the entrance and with the force
of such, knocking them off their feet, followed by more. Objects were
shook off the walls and sheetrock cracked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sonny
crawled backwards until the joining room. &ldquo;I thought Mario out
there would keep them off!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A scream
threatened to rise from Yoshi&rsquo;s throat, sliding that bookcase
over a tad. His plumber friend hadn&rsquo;t left the scene. He was in
his lawn, just sprawled out on his back, limp with a red dart in his
neck.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">This might
incite mockery, so be it. He respected and had always wanted to
allocate space for vigilantes like the Snifit Patrol to serve their
citizens. It wasn&rsquo;t shirking responsibility, not if he and his
brother did enough work for the entire US army in the real world.
Soft bed. Now.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A patio
sliding door shut. &ldquo;Mhm. I&rsquo;d offer some adventure
conclusion congratulatory champagne, but they spawn vines for some
reason-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah,
don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Luigi permitted himself to smile five layers of
under. The muted roar of the running water and comforting smells of
some baked good were sufficiently lulling without alcohol. There came
the patter of feet, the sudden absence of it.. He braced
instinctively as someone thunk next to him&hellip; Eh not that bad of
a bounce, not with the snuggling that ensued afterwards.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
glanced up at the ceiling made of bamboo rods. A redesign?...
&ldquo;Closer,&rdquo; he whispered, peering into rich dark brown
eyes, gleaming with energy. The short muscular arms of the toad
pulled him in by the waist with one arm, behind his back with the
other into tight, longing cuddles. Welling with serenity, warmth
spread throughout the human despite their &lsquo;unsexy&rsquo; thick
woolen and long pajamas. Nothing explosive, he was pleased the same
with their intimacy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-That
sounded like a... Are you outsourcing work in the castle?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;..I
was wondering that myself,&quot; Toad lifted from straddling him and
they stared.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">This
isn&rsquo;t your bed,&rdquo; they droned in unison.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
flipped off of each other, bashfully scanning the themed suite. Tiki
lights were on each side of the king bed, electric flames lighting
the tatami floor, the bamboo furniture, and glass wall leading out to
a patio. A telescope was propped near it, aimed at a chillingly blue
moon. The ocean tide low, Sidesteppers zigzagged around innumerable
objects, unplucked treasures scintillating on the beach, which also
held, a netted tennis court, a golf course further back, and a water
park farther, closed for the night. Back indoors, tight bleed from
under the door out, objects or people blocking it occasionally. They
knew they were in a full on resort.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;ll
return then,&rdquo; the servant informed.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Tada!&rdquo;
Toad laughed as he slid off. &ldquo;This is how the scope works.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
swung his legs over the edge. And&hellip; Not what he expected.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Y-you
could have warned it&rsquo;s this immersive!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
wasn&rsquo;t a good sprint to the patio glass either. Luigi pressed
against it, apparently forgetting it had a latch. &ldquo;Is there an
exit? What&rsquo;s the parameter? Are we on a physical plane?&rdquo;
He reached for the fringes of Toad&rsquo;s half buttoned shirt, then
beyond that, feeling around his hairless chest so academically it
didn&rsquo;t register what he was doing. &ldquo;Okay, so far this
checks out.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
other stuff checked out too, heh heh.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His arms
returned to his sides, flushed. &ldquo;T-toad!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">If
this was overstepping I&rsquo;m sorry! I wanted to do something wild
with you because, I know this is early but, I love you. I don&rsquo;t
expect to hear it back, just saying.&rdquo; He forced some liveliness
again. &ldquo;But yeah I think we&rsquo;re the only people that
aren&rsquo;t Skylandian that know about this.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi spun
him his way by both shoulders. &ldquo;-Why, is there a catch? Do you
never wake up sometimes?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
leaned into his ear, or as close as he could. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s..simpler.
They were up in, you know, the clouds and pretty introverted folks. I
think you can sympathize with that.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He rolled
his eyes. &ldquo;Toad, I love you,&rdquo; slipped out, quite easily
actually. &ldquo;Is it also as simple as checking out? We didn't
waste any dream dollars on this room did we?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Of
course not!&rdquo; In came the butler from before with a tray. Toad
and Luigi held where they were tentatively while the cover lifted
from the delicious Couples Cake. &ldquo;I hoped we would share this
someday.&rdquo; The scowling bowtie wearing boo diddly letting the
dessert splat on the floor, whipping out a racket, glinting in the
moonlight.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Two
objects clashed with a sonic clap! Luigi peeked over his shielding
elbow where a blue mushroom emblem racket was holding it off.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Where&rsquo;d
that come from??&rdquo; Booigi growled.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Shoulda
read the pamphlet, kid,&rdquo; Toad quipped.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo socked
him in the stomach. Toad folded over, then pulled them down with him,
releasing a carton of golf balls to trip Boo up. He stuffed a
flotation tire from over their head, to blind them and another whack
sent the boo over the bed. Luigi reached until he found the Bowser
racket while the boo rebound all over the room, destroying
everything. He made his shot with the fury of the game he never got
to play in, slicing them into orbit- or through the glass, spilling
onto the patio. The human and toad scrambled out, bare feet even, to
catch up to the jealous ex embedded in the sand. If Saul T. was the
Genesis of Booigi&rsquo;s rampage, this was the </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Revelation</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Boo,
stop this now!! I barely knew you were pining for me like that. Look,
it won't work, sorry, for reasons besides you hating toads when the
bad ones have been gone now for decades. You're too young. We could
be friends, but that's it, unless of you keep hanging out with
vindictive toad-hating lunatics. Who could that have been, even?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After a
realization, Toad dropped the champagne bottle he was welding.
&quot;Appropriately his name rhymes with witch.&quot;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Banktoad
coiled like a rusted spring the longer the search prolonged around
the sand fortress of the mushroom shaped Water Land island. When the
wind blew the brigade were smoldered by the burning fumes of the kart
that brought them there, smoking from the engine blowing up. They&rsquo;d
all gotten out and pushed it the rest of the way, through knee-high
marshland, some of them wishing they were in that luxury jetliner
instead, yes the one that almost fell out of the sky..</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-We
saved the treasure already! Why are we still sorting through that
stuff??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Unanswered,
Banktoad thawed seeing blue toad with the cracked glasses implacable
for once. That made sense, Bank would recall. He kept babbling,
afraid of &lsquo;sirens&rsquo; in the water earlier.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Captain,&rdquo;
Hint spoke up. &ldquo;Are you having a merry time over there?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
Captain gasped, pulling his nose from the indigo vest. &ldquo;Ah!
Why, of course,&rdquo; he chuckled, tucking it in a pocket. &ldquo;Ah
hem. Where is our trader?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">From
around the fortress sautered a tepid koopaling. Sans her signature
bow, loose bleached hair danced across her forehead with each step in
the heels. She was also, the brigade all sharing the same face for a
moment, not who they expected from the all caps request. They had no
clue either why she&rsquo;d used the pseudonym RAP (as in hip hop?).
Perhaps not being able to hold a tune explained her awful mood from
the jump, refusing to extend for The Captain meeting her half way.
That shoulder was so cold he felt it, snow flurries speckling down.
Wendy snuck a glance around. It was told to her that her weather
powers took a break, so it was good they were returning.. Maybe.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Greetings
Princess Wendy! As equal opportunity artifact hunters we are in fact
not perturbed over you being the client-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Someone
loudly coughed behind him.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Deal,
princess?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Listen
sugar..One thing..I can get that Jewel of the Stars, but only after..
You do a lil&rsquo; something.. For me..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He snapped
his fingers impatiently, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re busy, young lady. Come on
boys, time to push the car all the way back home-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wendy
huffed, delicately holding her earpiece in. None of this was how she
planned, but the voice guiding was so insistent.. &ldquo;Chill! It&rsquo;s
in Mayor Koton&rsquo;s office. Right now, my &lsquo;informant&rsquo;
said. I can trade it for your totally chic uh, &lsquo;Bronze Egg&rsquo;
if you get me in the office. How? Get Mr. Toad to drop out with your
famous impression-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yes!&rdquo;
he squeed, voice rising an octave.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">NO!&rdquo;
The brigade rushed the blushing Captain with complaints until he
snapped.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
must acquire that artifact! You should understand, William.&rdquo; He
jabbed his nephew. &ldquo;(That egg is C grade anyway. If she thinks
it is worth anything that&rsquo;s her problem..)&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The pallid
green toad nodded, his nerves grasped at.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The deal
revitalized, Wendy shook the leader&rsquo;s hand with the enthusiasm
of embracing Salvo the Slime, especially since his paws following
that mention of Mr. Toad had the same icky texture. &ldquo;IGGY!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy Delta
beamed next to his sister, present in body only. The rhythmic bobbing
of his half shaven head and mouthing of what sounded almost like
coordinates gave away that his earpiece matching Wendy&rsquo;s was
blasting math rock or similar. The Captain ripped his hat off,
headlamp, even shirt in front of everyone, to try on the indigo vest.
A different toad was unveiled then, his face broadening with
unbridled zeal.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;m
the best!&rdquo; he blared.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">OMG,
it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m in the room with that annoying little...
Good job.&rdquo; Wendy spared him a little applause. &ldquo;Iggy,
like, video record &lsquo;Mr. Toad&rsquo; dropping out. We show this
to Koton and it&rsquo;s game over.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Her
brother brought a phone up lackadaisically. &ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you
gonna talk this out?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Do
I look like Luddy? We&rsquo;re flipping the script. And action!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yellow
Toad yawned, lumbering in the way. Before he was clobbered he caught
his captain&rsquo;s fist, wide awake. &ldquo;Hey! Guess what.&rdquo;
He suddenly dumped a giant bottle of extra strength PM cough syrup,
the oozing orange liquid spreading around his hiking books. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
gathered all my evidence, and some of you have some </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">interesting</font></em>
<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">to put it as
flatteringly as possible, dreams. I&rsquo;ll take this by the way.&rdquo;
He plundered the egg from Mailtoad&rsquo;s grasp.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mordecai!
That was William-&rdquo; (WTF, the nephew protested) &ldquo;-levels
of incompetence!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">But-
Captain.. I-&rdquo; the purple toad stammered, not doing much of
anything. His captain ran him over to get to Yellow Toad, unable to
hop for it yet again.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wendy face
palmed. &lsquo;Toadys&rsquo; fighting was like watching Junior&rsquo;s
little friends scrapping it out, about as close as they could get to
the adorable threshold in her eyes. The folly made the &lsquo;ally&rsquo;
in her ear easier to digest at least.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">J&ouml;rg,
give me that!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No
Stan, it's time I have lines.&rdquo; Steely, he rose a brow at Wendy.
&ldquo;Miss, would you like to learn the history of our infamous
brigade?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She filed
her nails. &ldquo;Not reeeeeally.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Na?
Don&rsquo;t spoil this my dear. The Toad Brigade formed with Stan and
Bill meeting for the first time in a geology college class. The
remainder of us were assembled on campus. I am sure you&rsquo;ve
heard of the rest of our travels until the last with Toadette, after
which we separated, richly rewarded. Heinemann returned to teaching.
Mordecai went to the post office and those were the only months Toad
Town's delivery system worked efficiently, and I- investigative
research.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
Captain stopped hopping, glaring. &ldquo;And you learned what,
Sherlock??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
gleaned and you and Bill took on a new and exciting position too.
What was it about that middle of the night call to reassemble? You
proposed we research, excavate, and catalog artifacts, not to curate
for a museum, to expunge. Why? Might it be to profit off of your
'nephew&rsquo;s -HWUH!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
Captain strangled the life out of him on the spot so suddenly
everyone froze.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Now this
was getting good, Wendy thought until a handcuff was slapped on one
wrist. &ldquo;You're under arrest!&rdquo; announced Snifit Patrol.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">IGGY
HEEEEEELP!&rdquo; she screeched, cracking the windshield of his
patrol car parked downhill.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Reality
rushed back to Luigi and Toad within. It took convincing that they
were actually awake with the fogged up windows and snow flurries
swirling in the tropics. They managed to spill out and those vertical
flipping doors and tumbled over each other into slush. They clung
automatically in the frigid temperatures. The palm trees and tropical
foliage were dead or had icicles hanging, ice cubes bobbed in the
ocean, and the sand castle ahead was frosted over.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
snagged the plumber before he dove into the fray. &ldquo;Luigi. Let
Sumeet do his job.&rdquo; He was blinked at. &ldquo;... Don&rsquo;t
worry, your internal monologue is safe with me,&rdquo; he whispered
huskily.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The height
difference placed Toad&rsquo;s head midway up his ribcage, though his
disposition had no issue traveling the rest of the way up, Luigi
grinning back. &ldquo;I'm obligated to do something, aren&rsquo;t I?
I&rsquo;ll just monitor,&rdquo; he whined playfully.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">For once
Toad didn&rsquo;t take it jokingly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want it to
become compulsive or hollow like what happened with Mario. That&rsquo;s
all. You&rsquo;re freezing stiff by the way.&rdquo; He slipped his
hand under Luigi&rsquo;s dress coat, circling his lower back.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Valid
points. Darn it. How did he do it ?</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-What?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Warm
me up.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">From his
tip toes, the toad eagerly pressed his lips on him, rearing them
back, pinning him against the kart. He became hot, yet he shivered.
They were goofing off! Wasting time! Yet it stopped. Luigi wasn&rsquo;t
initially sure if that&rsquo;s what he was asking for, but he got the
answer quickly. It was explosive.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
motionless occupant with discolored knots all over their body was
going to speak up at some point from the back seat. Blushing, they
borrowed the Bowser racket for one more stunt and poofed away. They
got the message.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
piercing wail was Wendy&rsquo;s ticket away from that masked
nuisance. She flung off her heels and ran frantically, like fleeing a
party she and friends had no business in, climbing up the wall of the
castle until she was at the tallest spire. It hit her, what was she
doing?? Looking down on them, she got vertigo seeing the entire
island blanketed in white.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy
beamed with her again, grappling with her in the small cone shaped
space. &ldquo;Watashi wa makeru wake niwa ikanai!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re saying!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~Someone
uses dubs over subs!&rdquo; he sang whimsically.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Shut
up! If we&rsquo;re gonna brawl, brawl.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
prefer Melee.&rdquo; Iggy unsheathed a short newly invented Beam
Sword 8000. The screen split diagonally, brother and sister on
opposite sides, baring teeth, claws out, lightning bolts from one
pupil to the other. In his mind at least. The Wendy menace would be
defeated and he would be a star.<br/>
&hellip;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;And
they considered US tire kickers..&quot; The Captain muttered, hanging
partially out the window below that skirmish.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Stanley,
quit it already!&quot; Banktoad urged, pulling him from that
precarious space. &quot;Dismiss the brigade again, and let's move
back to Mushroom City. (Like I wanted to get through to you in the
car..) I'll manage my kleptomania and every other way I'm messed up.
I promise.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
Captain chuckled, pinching his jaws like he was four, about
twenty-five years before they ever met. &quot;As tempting as that is
William, the only thing I adore more than you is when I have an
opportunity to use my Mr. Toad impression.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bank toad
rocked the Bronze Egg back and forth with his foot, retrieved during
that police busting confusion. &quot;Can't you in private..like-&quot;
He paused as the stragglers tried to push into the passage they were
in from the opposite side of the sandstone door, securely propped
shut with a one ton backpack. &quot;-Like you used to drive me nuts
within that thin walled apartment we had? Oh and-&quot; He pried The
Captain's fingers off, snapping them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;OUCH
yes,&quot; he shrieked, &quot;Hah.. But you see, having it recorded
and viewed by millions? You cannot ignore that we have the same spot
pattern, blood type, height, and physique. I am identical to Mr. Toad
K Toad, in every way,&quot; he boasted, eyes glimmering. &quot;I'd be
cemented as his number one.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;..What?
Because he hates you back. Fan?&quot; Bank stared a little harder,
The Captain never learning how to human enough to interpret it. &quot;Are
you really asexual?&quot; he asked bluntly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His grin
was wiped right off. &quot;I said I didn't date anyone,&quot; he
corrected.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bank took
one step closer. &quot;Interesting.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Why??
Are you jealous over my feelings?&quot; Skittishly The Captain took
the egg again, holding it like a shield between them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The one
armed toad stopped where he was, biting his lip. &quot;God, how you
were on point for once? </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yes</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">,
because I have no one else duh. But.. we can't hide how we perpetuate
each other any more. You're just as dependent on me!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
Captain swallowed that lump in his throat. &quot;I suppose J&ouml;rg
was on to something. Despite our quarrelling, I appreciate you this
much-&quot; Some part of his brain going haywire, he tossed aside
that tacky egg to latch onto the green toad and give him a
gentlemanly kiss on the cheek.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bank held
him there, caressing his face. &quot;Ah. Well. I don't know why I
want to do this but-&quot; He tongued him, a soft purr escaping from
The Captain spontaneously. They pulled apart then at the same time,
the short encounter exactly as viscerally confusing as they'd both
imagined.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I'm
still gonna do the impression.&quot; the flushed Captain squeaked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh
come on! I gave in for nothing?&quot; His nephew's lunge for him
froze upon a small controlled detonator activation, blowing the door
open. Sandstone blocks and debris from the adventure pack propagated,
clouding a passage that Snifit Patrol cut through unhindered. He
tased the Captain and Banktoad so that they both collapsed on the
spot disoriented. Yellow Toad crept from behind the handcuffing
officer for the egg in the corner. It was evil he could psychically
detect.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Drop
that evidence!&quot; the officer ordered too late.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yellow
Toad hurled it out the window.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A shiny
object whizzing by koopalings. Wendy kicked off her brother, reaching
out in vain from the roof as it plunged into chilly waters. &quot;No
no nooo!&quot; He stopped her from diving into the ocean, just
barely.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hint Toad,
from the shore area where his own Captain had subdued him earlier,
witnessed firsthand the impact spot bubble and blacken, spreading out
steadily, darkening even the icebergs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">WELL DONE
FREEING MY DUMB SILENT FRIEND MUNCHZTAR INSTEAD.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With bated
breaths, the siblings on the roof shook out the earpods.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">NICE TRY.
I AM GOD OF INDULGENCE RAPSCINTILLATION. I AM NOT CHAINED TO ONE
MORTAL TO CARRY OUT MY PURPOSE LIKE OTHER LOSERS. HA. HA. HA.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lips broke
apart back at the police car. The toad and human, shed coats off on
the snow, many buttons undone on both, stepped apart in a feverish
daze before purple toad that ran up on them. As Mailtoad hauntingly
directed their attention over some, the lovebirds' hearts pumped
rapidly for a different reason.</font></p>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ignatius H
Koopa was notorious for: inventing, graduating at twelve, changing
his hair color genetically, believing in the Fang-Fairy, and
programming a chess-playing AI so proficient it was classified
self-aware and monitored by some governments.. In aggregate he should
have thwarted the &lsquo;Wendy Menace&rsquo;, yet oily goop skimmed
the ocean beyond his technologically aided perception, and cheep
cheeps, dolphins, jelectro, and bloopers squirmed helplessly.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Noooooooo!...Psyche!&ldquo;
On the sand castle rooftop, Wendy O. Koopa lifted a megaphone.
&ldquo;YAAAS! All your water are belongs to me!!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy laser
eyed that to powder. &ldquo;-Wendy-chan, you&rsquo;re dangerously
underestimating what you&rsquo;re partnering with! It&rsquo;s Sirena
Beach all over again!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She pushed
away from him, the sun&rsquo;s resurgence through the winter storm
catching her blue eyes, the only element around that color as she
craned upwards, &ldquo;They can have the ocean back- which was mine
anyway in my opinion, if they vote for me Monday!&rdquo; Suddenly one
of her wrists was joined to the other with a metallic click.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You&rsquo;d
better rally from the big house then. You are under arrest for
conspiracy, pollution, and trading stolen property, young lady!&rdquo;
chimed Snifit Patrol, dragging her off the roof.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The first
she had to cross on the ground was the last she wanted to see. &ldquo;Next
time, leave the megaphone thing to me, homegirl.&quot;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
HATE TOOOOOAAAADDDSSS!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">While
dealing with paperwork on the spot, Snifit Patrol was pledged by the
commotion of the koopaling&rsquo;s aquatic enemies beating on the
patrol car with palm branches. He ordered Toad and Luigi to get out
of there, dumping five pounds of C-4 on them to protect themselves.
It dawned that a couple- many things weren&rsquo;t right, like the
koopaling captive being allowed to text already.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wendy.
Really?&ldquo; Luigi crouched, tapping the glass.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Her bottom
lip quivering, the teen silently pressed the cracked Bowserphone
against the glass. A rival Badlands High posse had commented on her
blog:</font></p>
<p><em>&lsquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey
emo princess. If you want that prince, be ready because we want him
too and it will be on sight. If not, you will be accused of &lsquo;teh
ghey&rsquo;. Either way, expect ostracism!!!&rsquo;</font></em> 
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
straightened his posture, brushing against Toad whose own response
was caught in the back of his throat, especially with Iggy about to
creep up on them. Luigi at least managed some astute remark- &ldquo;How
about you focus on your bail first? Then that other stuff.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
stuff? Baka!&rdquo; Iggy exclaimed. &ldquo;&lsquo;Queen&rsquo; Wendy
O. is a serial grifter, manipulator, and pity party hostess-.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Gosh
shut up!&rdquo; She beat against the back of the seat. &ldquo;My life
is over, for real, all because some prick took a selfie at the last
prom precisely when I happened to stand too close to this Prince of
Nimbus Land douche. I don&rsquo;t &lsquo;like&rsquo; him or anyone at
school but even if I could fly rockets like you I don&rsquo;t think I
could ever outrun the rumors! I can&rsquo;t toss money at this and
make it go away! I can&rsquo;t rely on old Anti-Ma friends. Now I
won&rsquo;t even be mayor, where for once I&rsquo;d have some
autonomy. Don&rsquo;t you get it??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dumbstruck,
Iggy shifted away from the cop car. &ldquo;..So, Luigi and Toad-san..
Before you go..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The cyborg
koopaling produced his tablet again with a live satellite feed. A
dark red mass orbited their planet, mass perceivably increasing in
dimension. He also faxed over a passage from Ludwig, though his way
probably drove the point home already.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Reading
that note was the worst thing she could have done. Every country road
she memorized melted together- crystallized rather in the nippy
weather. The pink toad girl leaned against the ostro stop, tuckered
out, wishing she endured the piercing radio Daisy kept messing with
in the Birthday Girl. Her compass acting strange, she kicked the pole
and then had to dodge the falling icicles.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Howdy,
Probabilly K. here. Sorry fer the delay. Ice on the wings..&rdquo; A
paratroopa in a dark blue jumpsuit approached, offering his machine
oil stained hand intrepidly. &ldquo;Whatcha need darlin?&ldquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
gingerly took his hand. Notably when they let go, the janitor
immediately went to hugging himself up, shivering. &ldquo;I was
trying to locate my- a friend. He is either a blue toad and 5&rsquo;0
or a fifty story tall, three headed-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He swooped
her over frosted over prairies until in the sparsely populated shanty
town, where he got dicey, diving, spiraling at random, and it wasn&rsquo;t
like the toad girl could safely ditch him. Would he make up his
mind??</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Meanwhile,
Paper Macho friend actors unanimously kicked out a cowboy through the
swinging doors of the theater. He shook off the red dust, rushing
back.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">At
least give me a week for the mustache, it&rsquo;ll be darker.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The snifit
director replied, &ldquo;Our head&rsquo;s still split&rsquo;n from
yer wails of &lsquo;YA-HOO!&rsquo;. Walk on home boy!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Disgruntled
actors tossed props, paper cacti with real spikes, barrels, and the
kitchen sink at him as he backed into Toadette, just dropped in.
Together they escaped down another street, the toad girl finally
getting a decent look at her ex. Hard to miss against the rime
coating the South, Bucken-Berry glowed red still, otherwise he was
sound, she estimated, as cowpoke extra, in a red and white plaid
button up, denim jeans, and spurred leather boots, all a size off.
Probably missed because he hadn&rsquo;t been a toad for a while now,
peach fuzz shade his upper lip, one of the few toads that could grow
anything at all.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Babe,
lost track of time,&rdquo; he sputtered. &rdquo;You know, no watch
cause I didn&rsquo;t have arms this morning? Mr. Toad wired Drew a
ton of coins to blast more radiation off the books and it worked, I&rsquo;m
just &lsquo;dimorphic&rsquo; and we&rsquo;ll need more sessions to
fix that, but-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She kept
her focus on her scuffed shoes, trying to pave over that perfect
excuse Dr. Toad had to keep seeing him. &quot;Oh great!...&rdquo;
Abruptly shifting. &ldquo;What about you trying to join them back
there?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well,
most of the scripts have a Mario impersonator. I know it sounds crazy
but the theater was close and anything I&rsquo;ve ever wanted to do-
I just went for it.&hellip; You okay?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
walked a little longer then she spilled, &ldquo;Um. You implied you
could sense disturbances while in that previous form? Like with Mr.
Toadsworth? He wrote me this...&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><em>&lsquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~Miss
Toadette, if I do not explain now, this may be lost forever. Queen
Toadstool possessed an insatiable appetite for knowledge, especially
regarding the spiritual. Our princess was two months old when the
Queen retreated barefoot onto Star Hill. Our leaders knew losing her
had to do with the Stars above, falsifying the explanation of brain
fever for her demise. In retaliation, I concealed the Queen&rsquo;s
scrolls and &lsquo;utensils&rsquo; from them and now retribution has
arrived...</font></em> 
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Solemnly,
his rough textured hand slid over hers. &ldquo;I heard Ala-Gold on
Star Hill. I knew, well, his body&rsquo;s waiting to be shipped to
Ricco Harbor for burial, but that psycho imposter seemed so real...
Far as Mr. Toadsworth goes.. Let&rsquo;s not get caught up with
mistakes made before we were even born, just our own. Trust me,
babe.. It&rsquo;ll be okay. &rdquo; He closed in for a quick kiss on
the cheek.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She smiled
back at him, blushing. Cutting through an ice flower orchid of &lsquo;Lil
Oink Napoleon's&rsquo;, escapee Paper Macho Outlaws were chowing on
brittle rusty machinery. Craving fresher mechanical parts, they stomp
with a distinct rattle towards the fancy kart parked near a power
station, Daisy absorbed in switching radio bands.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
let go. &ldquo;Darn it..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Using the
picket fence for cover, the blue toad went one way, blasting paper
freaks into paper scraps and metal wires with his prop guns. Daisy
swiveled around wide eyed at the monsters, with an expletive or two.
Toadette went opposite of the commotion to sneak around, jump in the
car, and play GTA with those hooligans. When she smacked into a
Mecha-Yoshi, the first in a league of six heading over, she played
GTFO actually, scurrying away as their lasers ripped up farmland.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Pink and
blue toads managed to spill into the car with only a few skin graces
and burns, gritting their teeth and huddling low with Daisy under the
light show. Windows shattered. Tires burst. Green particles flowing
around induced weightlessness. That was new.. The princess rose her
head directly above..</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Gods,
finally,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;This is why I don&rsquo;t gotta
FCC in my kingdom. Nobody got time for this kinda suspense!&rdquo;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The small
shed with a beaten BMX bike chained against it became the dino&rsquo;s
salvation from certain death, the rest of the yard boxed by tall
wooden fences. Sonny joined him, alternatively ducking and shooting.
A round later, the toad agent slammed back against the metal panels,
groaning as the cartridge jammed. &ldquo;Cover me!!!&rdquo; He
dropped a smaller handgun from his vest. Yoshi peeked around at the
gumdrop shaped creature waddling close, lit cigar, guns carried by
invisible arms.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario was
always the weapons bearer in safaris. Consequently he rolled out to
launch a more familiar perfectly aimed egg. With a crack of the
shell, the rogue agent flipped over the next door fence. Huffin
puffins clucked in distress, drawing the attention of a chain chomp.
The horrific screams of 0088 becoming the stray&rsquo;s chew toy
began to fade in the distance.</font></p>

stalk her, just say hi when I&rsquo;m at Harry's Shop&hellip; Where
she&rsquo;s assistant manager. Info she volunteered willingly so-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
spared a sympathetic glance on the youngster, his blush almost
luminous with the shadow passing over him. &ldquo;Riiight, Emerson.
Wherever you ask her out, don&rsquo;t show her those pinups you have
until at least the third date..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
dislodged dart lay in a crease of the sidewalk, Goombario carefully
studying it with the aid of a book. Mario breathed raggedly, stirring
every fifteen licks from Poochy on his palm. &ldquo;-Mr. Yoshi, long
time no see! It&rsquo;s Goombario, or paladin of the Mario Anti
Defamation League,&rdquo; boasted a young geekish goomba with square
fangs and a blue ball cap, backwards now. A touch hipper. Just a
touch. &ldquo;It dawned that I let this weekend's debacle happen to
my man, and I had to do something, being within walking distance..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
sprawled motionless in his yard garnered the attention Yoshi expected
and then some, besides the old partner, neighbors casting glances he
didn&rsquo;t like. He quietly slipped away to ask about that poison,
appalled he didn&rsquo;t the first time. When he hopped into the
backyard again, Sonny was face down in the lawn where he last saw
him. The dino dove to his side. There was no dart this time-</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I..
never.. Got. to..meet..Wendy O..&rdquo; Agent Toad coughed up blood.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
happened??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Up..
there..sir. T-too- late.. I designed Project Z with.. A..
90%..fatality rate..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
craned to the black triangular glider. A dark grey shy guy attached
to it held a contraption with a dish on the end, invisible waves from
it distorting the light purple sky and clouds. Like a bob-omb
detonated in his skull, Yoshi was hurled against the shed in agony
from head to toe.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">(Behind ya
bro! Emerson had anti-boo walls or something? Now get me out! They&rsquo;re
stealing my signature ability!!.. Yeah it&rsquo;s who you think,
sped.&rdquo; Someone violently shook the shed door from the inside.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
swiped up at the latch. The entity barged out and, offense restoring
lucidity, weird but it worked, Yoshi leapt from the ruckus of the
glider crashing through the toad agent&rsquo;s roof. The Agony ray
cracked over his head into crude handmade pieces, then more fell from
the sky that he dodged, heavy tactical boots, severed legs laced in
them, a robed torso sliced cleanly, and the final portion, all
accompanied by deep red blood splatter.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Anti-Guy&rsquo;s
disembodied head rotated mask up at, inches from his orange boot. &ldquo;I
hope the overseas forgers ruin that insolent pup..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sonny
crawled over, asking simply. &ldquo;Who got him?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
cocked his head to the side, speechless.</font></p>
<p><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Whoosh.</font></em>
&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Guess
who&rsquo;s back?&rdquo; teased a gruff, greyish purple sphere with a
short tail and sharp teeth, originating from the breached tackle box
in the shed, a tray of medical equipment balancing on the lid. Their
eyelids rose over the empty sockets. &ldquo;For an encore. The one!
The only.&rdquo; They brought their arms up, one half severed- &ldquo;
Ah, nevermind. You know who I am and I don&rsquo;t do monologues. By
the way, not cool bro.&rdquo; Zoo revealed a chunk of his head
missing, cut cleanly to the brain. &ldquo;This is why I didn&rsquo;t
give my body to science ever!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Following
a tense few seconds, the toad agent grappled the dino into a
chokehold. &ldquo;-I know, Mr. Munchakoopas. Yes I opportunistically
made that weapon. Before I was pushed into acting at Neon Heights I
studied engineering. It wasn&rsquo;t all fake though, Spy Guy had
infiltrated the mail services- looking for the patient of MY
insurance to survive in the agency until I&rsquo;m in the big league.
Think cars, vacations, women.. If the bullies don&rsquo;t kill me by
then.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
resisted the urge to snap his pale fingers in half. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
earn respect overnight either, so I&rsquo;m impressed by your
composure in the face of prejudice on the job.&rdquo; He kicked
himself up, swinging the toad over his shoulder and away where he
rolled. &ldquo;But you have much to learn. Where&rsquo;s Zoo??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Scrapping
with me while you have your little moment.&rdquo; A red boo with a
certain sleazy quality about him, decked in winter gear and needing a
shave, held onto Zoo with great difficulty.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Trevor-?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah
yeah, bet you wish it was some hot shot like Lt. Stone. Yeah no. You
get to deal with me. I hate you got rid of my poker partner 0088, but
I&rsquo;ll help you off Charles like you did Rodney if you throw next
Thursday&rsquo;s game-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Forget
that! I think your girlfriend ran into some problems on duty. There&rsquo;s
a public list of King&rsquo;s guards that are.. terminated..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo got
the slip vanishing into the shadows. M snapped to reality and
followed underground. In less than a second he came back tugging onto
a bigger boo with a gold crown, dark bags around his purple glowing
eyes from jet lag, holding a full martini glass he dumped into the
grass quickly. &ldquo;Peon, let me go immediately! Like it&rsquo;s
not enough I lost my casino and I&rsquo;m homeless and my bank is
closed on Sunday!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">King Boo
poofing away, M brought up a pale green white haired and mustached
boo. As irate, he whacked the agent with the shopping bags he&rsquo;d
carried. &ldquo;Hmph. Don&rsquo;t you dare interrupt my errands for
the Lady!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">M tried
one last time. &ldquo;-I&rsquo;ll get in so much trouble if I don't
complete community service!&rdquo; Boo E. Diddley, his neighbor in
Forever Forest, had a dull axe and a construction helmet worn down
low, the struggle making it fall off.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo?
Oh stars..&rdquo; Yoshi trailed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The toad
agent barged ahead, shaking the red boo.&ldquo;-Why can&rsquo;t you
find him?!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dude
I can&rsquo;t.. Focus enough. What the heck happened to Bridget??&rdquo;
M screamed back. When the toad hesitated, the red boo unleashed a cry
and beat him across the head with Anti-Guy&rsquo;s bamboo dart rod,
breaking it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sonny held
his jaw. &ldquo;Okay! Boo or Booigi did it!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Agent M
whipped over as Boo took the arm of the dinosaur, frozen from what
he&rsquo;d encountered in the middle of Boo&rsquo;s forehead. &ldquo;Sorry.
I&rsquo;ll..handle this..&rdquo; they slowly lead the citizen from
the scene.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Good
thing. There was someone hiding among the hedges, lacking the
inherent stealthiness of a boo, though rivaling in talent. The agents
weren&rsquo;t sure how they missed it. It was bright gold.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lord
Bowser, I insist these will sooth you. I borrowed it from Kammy.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
flicked the tiny sloshing bottle aside. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s never
soothed, gramps.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">..Good
point.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Anyway,
I gotta call it a day on page five it is... Hey, how the heck does
anybody stare at screens for eight or nine hours??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kamek
scuttled to retrieve the eyedrops. &ldquo;Tolerance and not setting
the brightness to 120 percent, my lord. I am sure your computer aided
proclamation is delightfully wicked the same..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Duh!
You think I&rsquo;m some kinda-YOW!&rdquo; His back cracked when he
lifted off that office chair. &ldquo;Just.. Here! Double check I hit
the floppy thingy.&rdquo; Half mangling the cables, Bowser tore the
laptop off his desk, the ray from screen brightness bashing the
magikoopa through the door, walls and out of the castle from the O on
the BOWSER logo. Bowser blindly stepped a portion of the hole made,
plummeting floors down. A rainbow haired koopaling flipped in his
chair as his father mashed all his art supplies..</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">OMG.
King Dad, umm-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
growled, facing the direction of the voices. &ldquo;Why are you doing
here?!?&rdquo; He hopped up in the Koopa Troop computer lab, kicking
aside the plastic playskool table as he pressed the map previously
stuck to his plastron to his face. The printers lined against the
wall were steadily spitting out photocopies too. &ldquo;Were you
trying to sneak into the city???&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Roy jumped
between them. &ldquo;Dad, it&rsquo;s on me. Dere&rsquo;s dis concert
tonite &lsquo;n-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-We
were gonna sell bootlegs on the street. Cha-Ching!&rdquo; Larry added
on the side.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">In
addition to that I, myself, Morton Jr would use my cacophonic pleas
to divert us to the shopping mall to buy the new Air Koopa sneakers
promoted by the rapper-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy
suddenly phased in. &ldquo;And then I, Super Mercenary Iggy Delta
with my ability to translate any lyric into Japanese on the spot-&rdquo;
He checked his smartphone after it played a sound effect. &ldquo;-Oh
geez.. Okay, BRB guys. Gotta enforce copyright right now.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
Junior wandered into the wispy spot he dematerialized from, pulling
along his toy train. &ldquo;Do I get to make an excuse?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Everybody,
you ain&rsquo;t in trouble!&rdquo; Bowser roared. &ldquo;In my
dedication to being the best ever, I can&rsquo;t see crap, so I need
help getting around. Wendy&rsquo;s locked up. Now where&rsquo;s
Ludwig?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Not liking
that silence, Bowser banged on a thin unmarked door, no opportunity
for customization from anyone. It didn&rsquo;t matter in this case,
the bass keys from a piano rumbling the walls..</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Vater..&rdquo;
Severe dry sounding coughing followed. The Koopa King&rsquo;s gut was
wrenched. His big plans relied on this one. &ldquo;Leave me here.&rdquo;
Cough. &ldquo;The others will lead you to the penitentiary&hellip; No
one will stray along the way, I swear!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
almost smelt a machination- but his commander would never, not in his
ill health and not after all the trouble the last one caused. Eased
he blindly stumbled off, giving someone a call. It didn&rsquo;t go
through at all. Now where would Mario be where his phone was
completely shut off?</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
couldn&rsquo;t believe he only saw it then. The green toad instructor
was mature, dressed so crisply it was intimidating. Following
Mushroom Enquirer fame the journalist went under his actual Mitch J
Toad, but back in the day, he was &lsquo;Weegee&rsquo;, the nickname
derived from his glassy piercing gaze and impressive if pedantic
ways. All for the better. Such a person should never be conflated
with Luigi.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Psst!&rdquo;
Mario ducked behind a propped up text book in the adjacent school
desk, passing a wrinkly copy paper.</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Who&rsquo;s
your special one?&rsquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
replied with the truth, slyly, also adding, &lsquo;Is your&rsquo;s
Bowser?&rsquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario&rsquo;s
initial reaction to smile brightened the dino&rsquo;s day. Then-</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No,
Yosh.&rsquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi read
it and passed it back, at a loss.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario&rsquo;s
pen poked the page for a moment, the instructor droning on. &lsquo;If
they say you only get one, how have I had multiple? If I&rsquo;m
missing something I need to be sure before I get into that mode of
thinking, especially with &lsquo;You Know Who.&rsquo; Another pause.
&lsquo;I guess Luigi was always braver than me in that area, because
dating wise-&rsquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
teacher seized the paper from under the plumber&rsquo;s nose.
&ldquo;Lesson&rsquo;s over dudes! Get ready for the 69th Annual Quirk
Quiz!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The class
setting broke apart in puzzle pieces, transforming into a purple
walled gameshow room, one side entirely blaring colorful bulbs. It
was so smoldering it was almost unbreathable, likely from that. A
seated audience consisting of creepy zeostars and starslaps, old
&lsquo;Weegee&rsquo; took the mic from the stand.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thanks
for being my third and fourth contestants ever. Get three questions
wrong and </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I..will..consume..you..</font></em>&rdquo;
<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">As shuffled
his cards, the audience heckled. &ldquo;What are the two most
deceitful things in the universe, often working in tangent?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
double X-Yux?&rdquo; Yoshi answered.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wrong!
It&rsquo;s &hellip;Alright, half a point, but the answer was &lsquo;humans&rsquo;
and &lsquo;toads&rsquo;...&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The next
question asked for the combined total of fifteen random items found
around town. Yoshi shopped online exclusively, out of the loop, and
Mario hadn&rsquo;t needed to shop much with the dowry of his heroic
services. When they guessed an x from the bulbs painted the room in
red. Pettily, that counted as two wrong answers.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Next,
is there a such thing as a toad hybrid?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
scratched his beard. &ldquo;Sure?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...Correct,&rdquo;
he muttered, the crowd booing. &ldquo;Moving on..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Under
that, Yoshi thought he saw a seam line near the audience, but before
he made a egg roll over-</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-What
is hidden in here?&rdquo; the host giggled at his cards.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
fabulous prize?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mitch
slung the mic stand out of his way. &ldquo;WRONG, Mario. I knew this
would happen to you without an intrepid partner in your ear. You&rsquo;ve
never really had to try, have you? Well now you can try as you may-
it won&rsquo;t matter!&rdquo; He trudged closer diabolically,
shoulders hunched.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That&rsquo;s
asinine Mitch. Like I&rsquo;m not always working!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah,
kickboxing, running, jumping, so innate and brainless you
disassociated ages ago and your so called close friends barely
noticed! Tell me, when exactly did you empty Curtis Mario out to
become the vessel the town could inundate with their love- or these
days, their hate?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario was
backed against the wall, clasping his head on both sides. &ldquo;It
wasn&rsquo;t- the folks here were so browbeaten from war when we
dropped in- They needed a perfect hero.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And
they got it, regardless of what this little jerk&rsquo;s
insinuating.&rdquo; Yoshi punched the journalist straight across the
face, taking care to wrinkle his clothes as he pulled him back up.
&ldquo;Check your four o clock, Mario!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario&rsquo;s
felt around for the indentation of the exit when evil stars from the
stands piled over the heroes. The pressure forced them through the
floor into roaring blue flames underneath. Everything burned,
maniacal laughter in the background as the exit panel was knocked out
by a previous contestant.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">If
you hear me, none of this is happening! It&rsquo;s all because I lost
the game. Not &lsquo;that&rsquo; game. Or do people still play The
Game? -Sorry. I can&rsquo;t help trapping people into phantom zones.
Yoshi, I can save you but Mario..&rdquo; Boo Diddley went blank. &quot;Oh
no. A bad guy, is about to take Camoztar and-!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mitch
crawled from under the pileup primal like, eyes flashing yellow.
&ldquo;Enough jabbering kid. If I&rsquo;m so darn reprehensible, find
me right now in the real world. Punish me.&rdquo;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He was in
the middle of cleaning dishes from an evening lunch. At least he&rsquo;d
remembered to eat this time. &ldquo;-Oh, early?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The trench
coat and fedora wearing guest shuffled into the adjoining, usually
closed-off room.<br/>
&ldquo;The princess wanted a single alteration,
Russ. You know efficiency is my forte. Ha.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The latest
addition to the usual maps tacked up and filled shelves was the large
banner from the last Mario Kart, draped in a temporary way, as
vibrant as the spines of the game books Russ read for leisure.
Contemplating their sessions with the conquest focused games gave him
a pinch of bliss until he encountered the coffee table, labeled and
arranged lapis lazuli bust pieces of &lsquo;Bowser&rsquo;s Brother&rsquo;
covering it. He rotated the gold ring around his index finger, wedged
in place..</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
know. Can we discuss something else?&rdquo; The blue toad leaned
against the doorway.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The seven
foot tall, red curly haired dragon koopa dropped on the couch. Russ
powered down the computer and slid in a chair on the way, stalling
unambiguously. He joined X on the tiny portion available, resting his
hand lightly on the leg the koopa crossed. &ldquo;Would you be the X
that is a contender for mayor?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mr. X
finally released some of that tension. &ldquo;Stars, ha hah., not
necessarily!&rdquo; He explained Mayor Koton&rsquo;s past as a thwimp
in King Morton&rsquo;s castle and how an ambassador tipped him on the
rampant toad slave labor. Russ was bewildered by how chaotic and
spontaneous it sounded from the most restrained person he knew, X
never intending to show up so any old joe could claim to be &lsquo;X&rsquo;
and usurp the thwimp. Did X have another friend now? Who had gotten
to him?</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The toad
let go of his cold scales with some embarrassment, sliding up his
glasses. &ldquo;So. Ah hem.. What story shall I give Mario about-? &rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Don&rsquo;t
tell him anything! Honestly this Mario and Bowser thing I keep
hearing about is&hellip; It has nothing to do with me.&rdquo;
Standing, he clasped his claws contemplatively. &ldquo;-As that
second expert I can call and inform him there&rsquo;s nothing more to
learn. Happy?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Russ stood
up to him, dwarfed. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Enough,
Russ! No one would ever understand my journey!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
did, Clarentine.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Following
the utterance of his name, Mr. X stared down at the blue spotted
toad, paralyzed. Of course he knew he knew, but- a bell went off.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">..Russ
T, it&rsquo;s Goombario. Quickly, does this Blue Falcon belong to
you? Some mask-wearing guy..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">X&rsquo;s
ears perked from an alcove in the back. He lifted a curtain as the
golden masked person hijacked it, stuffing a human inside. X burst
outside, flailing after his nitro fueled gift to himself, splurged on
less than a year ago. It hit zero to five-hundred, out of the block
in one second. Mr. X dropped to his knees in the middle of the road,
fedora and coat, missing, sweat beads rolling from his bumpy
forehead, down his snout.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Blue
koopa sir!&rdquo; Goombario had a novelty four person bike, a very
woozy dinosaur with a head bandage and an alert dog taking the slack
in the other positions. &ldquo;Yes, that was Mario getting kidnapped.
We can&rsquo;t let him get slandered again!&rdquo;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">EEeeeeeeeeeeek!&rdquo;
Toadette squeezed the daylights out of- She blinked again. It was
herself.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daze,
you cool?&rdquo; The other Toadette repeated, accidentally twirling
her dress. &ldquo;..This isn&rsquo;t my style?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Because
you&rsquo;re me, Toadette Kinopiko!&rdquo; replied &lsquo;Daisy&rsquo;.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And
I&rsquo;m you. Me. Daisy,&rdquo; said Bucken-Berry&rsquo;s body.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Every
sensation was different, from the way feet fit in shoes, to
proportions, skin color, center of gravity, weight and texture of
hair. Compounding it all, they were abducted into a half lab, half
kitschy furniture and orange shag carpet adorned spaceship.</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bucken-Berry&rsquo;
got his bearings. &ldquo;Guess what, I&rsquo;ve had x-ray vision
since yesterday so I ain&rsquo;t seeing nothing new far as Toads go.
All I wanted was to see the professor. Not that one tho.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
removed some bulky headphones that kept him oblivious mostly, using
the lab table to roll out blue prints, the corners weighed down by
his phone or wallet or pda. &ldquo;Ahhhhh!.. I mean hello again.
Forgive me, I was finalizing designs for the new Pipe Land facility.
We&rsquo;ll be 6555 miles closer than the Special World branch and I
know that is especially pertinent to you, Bucken-Berry.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bucken-Berry&rsquo;
wandered over awkwardly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll be.
Where&rsquo;s the professor?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Which
one? John Topper, professor of behavior? You know he was pivotal
when&hellip; Or you refer to Morris who majors in everything, making
him so dangerous.. Of course..&rdquo; and on he blabbered with
anecdotes of his much older friends, occasionally tugging on the blue
toad&rsquo;s plaid baggy sleeve.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bucken-Berry,
the real one watching in Toadette&rsquo;s form, already knew that
Drew wasn&rsquo;t very shy at all in the right circumstance, however
the real Toadette in Daisy's body was dying inside, bronze skin as
fair as the toads. Okay, it was funky to see &lsquo;himself&rsquo;
with someone else, and this was some comeuppance for her error, but
it went no further. He lacked the capacity to be with anyone right
now, something they&rsquo;d need to sit and talk about-</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
is this? Cease that frolicking, Drew!!!&rdquo; Dr. toad gawked at
Prof. X-Naut, continuing, &ldquo;- First John used my secret project

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">To

bro defended.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Whatever,

teleporter from *classified* to locate and retrieve my MacGuffin, an
inanimate object! I cannot be sued for any other side effects.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dawg,
wait!&rdquo; &lsquo;Bucken-Berry&rsquo; called before they got pushed
into an exit shoot. &ldquo;Could we reverse something with your time
machine?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Prof.
X-Naut retrieved from a drawer a web covered, analog character clock
ticking in a weak metallic way. The Sarasalandian princess discovered
it previously with the Hiyoihoi, and no she didn&rsquo;t do that
damage. &ldquo;That IS the MacGuffin, young man. The only safe way to
escape a Red Chomp is to open a temporal portal, alas, no, you cannot
resolve some relationship matter with it..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sorry
guys, Morris holds the belief that love is a fraud,&rdquo; Dr. T
chipped in from a yoga mat in the corner.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The space
alien shook more screws from it, ranting, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you shut
me up from exposing the ignis fatuus of the entertainment industry!
&lsquo;Crazy in Love&rsquo; is not just a hit from Beanyonce.. The
real explanation is that If I repair it, a future version of myself
called &lsquo;Sirrom&rsquo; will appear and smash it to bits with a
sledgehammer.&rdquo; He shrugged and when his mitten was in the air
somewhat, someone warped inside the ship and retrained it, like a
sleek maneuver from Snifit Patrol, except failing when the handcuffs
were too small for the x-naut. (He was sure the alien was about
Kammy&rsquo;s size. Apparently not.)</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
never as cool as it looks in your head.&rdquo; Iggy grumbled.
Resetting the intro, he slipped into his work uniform vivaciously
announcing, &ldquo;Iggy Delta of Nerd Squad here. Ready to fix-&ldquo;
He unsheathed the Beam Sword 8000. &ldquo;-Your faces for stealing my
Transporter-To-Convenient-Plotpoint-Location DLC!!&rdquo; He slashed
random things in half.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">In the
panic, Dr. Toad was sure to gather his plans. Only one person could
keep all his work from going down the drain, and from a sensation on
the back of his neck, a sibling connection, he knew he was in town
for an encore.</font></p>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The driver
visited every tile of the map, avoiding tire bursting pokies, violent
tweesters, and headwear stealing kleptos. The tour was sold out and
myths were shared at points of interest, though none as grand as
this:</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~Once upon
a time, patooie plant engineer was framed for mauling a guy while.
The Tostarena Town officers conscripted him for hard labor, during
which he secretly worked on a Mecha-Yoshi prototype, loosely based on
the mysterious Jaxi. He burst out and rode into the sunset until
settling in the podunk down in Southern Mushroom Kingdom!</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jr.
Troopa&rsquo;s story for the dueling yoshi and hammer bro sphinx: the
wide spot between them was definitely where an ancient civilization
held sports games, the sphinx being the mascots. Camera flashes
showered some nearby ruins, purportedly the afterparty zone. That
would explain why they were so deteriorated after all. Wait, since
when did he care? He had to get through the desert every day to get
to work. Oh right. The South was frigid, but weather was more mild
than ever recorded in Dry Dry Desert. He didn&rsquo;t get it, as
Tutankoopa&rsquo;s tomb rolled up. Huge as the stadium in Toad Town,
intricate stone work wrapped about the structure, a mere velvet rope
blocking the blue torch lit passageway with hieroglyphs. He wanted to
avoid the bottle neck out of the vehicle. That wouldn&rsquo;t be an
issue for another reason-</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Why
litter, mon ami?&rdquo; The driver waggled an empty syringe bag, one
of many.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The mildly
oafish King&rsquo;s guard, one of many spotted around, shook his head
in the face of the restless tourists. &ldquo;Not our doing. We were
in Area 64 and then it became so chilly this afternoon we-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Don't

being the one we send solo to carry water from the oasis.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Give
Reginald credit. He refrained from mentioning the part where you plan
on leaving your fallen comrades' bodies in there. Or how you&rsquo;ve
formed an independent boo-hunting faction.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Reginald
aimed his super scope, belatedly noting the shellfish creature had
already aimed his silenced pistol first, above the belt. Five
proximate guards drew their weapons in various states of wear and
disrepair, tourists dispersing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jr. Troopa
eagerly crouched under the van chassis, gaining more of a view than
he bargained for. A chestnut horse and a speckled chicken, two
recently missing animals of Bob the bob-omb buddy were in the
backdrop, strolling aimlessly in the tomb. The librarian had been
locked in a chest yesterday due to, quote: &lsquo;Jefe del Escuadr&oacute;n
Toad&rsquo;.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He whacked
his head on the axel. &ldquo;Buck-Wilde! Col-Turkey! Get outta
there!!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Their
commotion of trampling cedar boxes gave the noki the distraction
needed to check his dive watch, smooth sweeping seconds hand striking
the twelve. At the moment he divined, the two animals rounded
outside, leaping over the velvet rope, knocking over the closest
guards with the gun, then over the noki&rsquo;s head. Troopa was
picked- or nipped by Buck-Wilde like a chicken and kicked in the face
by the scrawny thin legs of Col-Turkey like she was some horse. The
belligerent livestock slung him away as sand shook from the crevices
of the temple. The ground rumbled from a horde of gauze wrapped
toads, Mummy-Mes. They cleaned out any stragglers while Noki pulled
the last person lingering aside, a tourist left behind from the last
tour.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Tu
es magnifique mon amour,&rdquo; Agent 0064 toyed, wrestling with him.
It wasn&rsquo;t much of a fight with the toad unable to move his
lower half of his body. &ldquo;At least you discovered the
revitalizing properties and not the blast this beautiful landmark
away ones. How did you find Nitro Honey Syrup?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Like
I&rsquo;d tell you, handsome. Ha, even when you haven&rsquo;t slept
in two days. Kinda impressive. Too bad your Jeremy can&rsquo;t
appreciate that anymore.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jelectro
dropped Mitch flat, growling, &ldquo;You boo minion lobotomized my
civil partner, Mitch&hellip; Agent N is in the hospital and I cannot
even visit him or his niece Ashley without compromising.. Ahg!&rdquo;
(Like a mini twisted therapy session, THAT unearthed.. No wonder he
was sloppy now. The noki could only down so many pills to stick in
the game..)</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mitch
calculatingly watched him tremble. &ldquo;Boo is still a decent
channeller on occasion, though I learned real quick it&rsquo;s better
to rely all on myself. I&rsquo;d say sorry but you can read my- Oh
you can&rsquo;t right. Darn. Shoulda made myself look better by
saying sorry- ha ha.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The noki
lashed out before he could stop it, kicking him in the gut. &ldquo;What
else do you know?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mitch
winched for a bit, then smiled through it. &ldquo;Too bad you didn&rsquo;t
break something.. There&rsquo;s a reason why I let you detect me. Why
I let her find me.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The black
Lexus launched off a dune, pulling up as he slid to the ground.
Twisting around, the noki wished he was a boo about then.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Get
in! Your Aston Mushroom&rsquo;s still safe in my driveway, Bond. As
for that ol Mitch. Yeah, let&rsquo;s take him too.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You&rsquo;d
better. That&rsquo;s my new car..&rdquo; he said, Kylie roughly
hauling him in the back seat.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hush.
As an enemy of the Kingdom, enjoy those heated leather seats one last
time. Everything you&rsquo;ve done is recorded, so if you hate toads
so much we&rsquo;ll ship you away from their town!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jelectro
slid his shades down, evidence blaring of forced entry, scratches and
bent fiberglass on the driver door. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t use pet names
from arch nemeses of mine, madam. Besides, arrest first, write book
reports later. Mitch is willing to destroy himself for whatever he is
yearning for.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yikes.&rdquo;
She cupped over her mouth. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just get to goin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
Unable to be as cruel as she wished, she took along and folded up his
wheelchair, cut off by the agent from the drivers seat. He wanted to
see something curious inside, a spectrum analyzer-like device crudely
yanked from one car, to be haphazardly taped to the center console.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The pink
shelled koopa reluctantly climbed in shotgun then. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
Dr. Houdini Toadley&rsquo;s Psycho Radar that.. I&rsquo;ll tell you
more later. It&rsquo;s too muggy to breathe.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Indeed..&rdquo;
He sped in the desert with the reporters. &ldquo;Did the bus accident
break both of his legs?&rdquo; he asked, as if he wasn&rsquo;t right
behind them.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Uh.&rdquo;
She turned to him anxiously. &ldquo;No. Just head trauma, spinal
issues.. Yep. Definitely. I saw.. And signed his papers..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hm.
Well they are both broken now and if you remove his shoes, aside from
smelly socks, you will find no toes left. Most severed by cutting, a
few by blunt twisting motion, one gnawed..&rdquo;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
was quick,&rdquo; remarked the Spindel, nearly the width of the room
as he stared her down.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
koopaling flipped through the packet another time for show. &ldquo;Imma
quick reader. Trust me..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Afterwards,
Wendy shivered on the Darklandian crest rug waiting for that final
confirmation of being out of the running, the record lows frosting up
the glass, clouding the rest of Neo Bowser City. Some Skylandians
were hanging about in support for that lame Mr. Toad, but her worries
were more with the Mayor Koton clan, thwomps guarding each door,
malice radiating from each she encountered. They understood she was
being forced didn&rsquo;t they? By the time she got her okay, she was
glad to leave the fortress that touched the poisonous clouds. Flat
footed without her heels she made the trek down the icy path alone
meeting her family and troop at the fortress stone gates.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yes,

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Seriously?-

Johnson and Hippity-Hop the last of her hot pink outfitted
&lsquo;disciples&rsquo; officially rejoining the Koopa Troop they
never really left.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Done,

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wendy
rolled her eyes at her dad.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Why
are y'all so mopey? I have GREAT news that&rsquo;ll really shake ya
up when we&rsquo;re home! Let&rsquo;s go go go!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">While they
crouched into the waiting limo on one side, it was so expensive and
roomy with multiple compartments, purposely chosen by Larry who knew
what singers and celebrities preferred, that Lemmy, Roy, Morton,
Larry, and Junior by accident snuck out, without notice. Well, too
late to tell the six year old to stay home with papa now. Neo Bowser
City had no speed limits and it was out of there.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy&rsquo;s
tentative deep breath fogged up his hand made map. It was do or die
to circumvent Skylandians, Koton&rsquo;s supporters, and whatever
else awaited between them and the mayor&rsquo;s office. He kept
trying to contact Iggy, going straight to voicemail. His absence was
going to sting like the ice water hitting his cold blooded body. As
koopa kids comradery was effortless, then they just had to grow up
and it get weird. Getting stuck in an ignore each other cycle was as
frightening as the static ghastly Tox Boxes resting on raised </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">sloping
altars</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">.
They passed them while journeying through the bramble filled
courtyard. It became apparent the entire building leaned some. Lemmy
didn&rsquo;t plan for that, nor the security system that greeted them
at the thick heavy entrance doors. Larry couldn&rsquo;t find usb
access to hack the terminal, nor could Morton and Roy brute force it
with a giant hammer and bill cannon respectively. Junior continued to
play in the background, ignored.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy,
you gotta contribute man. Do we crack the code? Jimmy the lock? Ring
the buzzer and ask politely?&rdquo; Morton tapped his brother&rsquo;s
head..</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
startled rainbow haired koopaling lost balance with the ball. He had
to think positively. They could do it. And prioritize. Deal with
interpersonal stuff later, now would endanger the world. With that he
could perk right up. &ldquo;Like, not that last one! We don't do
anything nice, hello?&rdquo; He waved around the scepter with the
perfect thing in mind when there was a loud screech of metal against
rock.</font></p>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It felt
random to her, but she supposed she happened to be in the one castle
chamber with a fax machine for a reason, folding it to consider
later. In solitude, the princess basked in the warmth of the sun
through the magenta, orange, and blue stained glass before it was
back to weightier matters. She tried to get through to Daisy during
the moment she had to spare, hearing her voicemail for the first
time. It was recently recorded too, because if older than a year it
would have predated the sinus surgery she'd gotten, and also at the
discretion of some official. Stating credentials formally, without
slang, she couldn't suppress her cockney accent very much. Present or
not, Daisy's 'just go for it' motto was her invisible guide, a ray of
light that followed her even when she left that room. It was
happening.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She used
the recently installed drawbridge, automated to lift and seal her
castle behind her, then approached the telescope on the cannon mound.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Four o
clock on the dot, her father&rsquo;s grossly oversized cheep cheep
blimp engulfed the lot of Royal Raceway. Poshley guards let King
Elderberry Toadstool out, tall, blockish head accented by a black and
gold mushroom shaped crown, the sides extending to the sideburns of
his dyed black beard. Diamonds twinkle from his ear lobes and
matching rings near his thick knuckles, no other adornments. The
moment his cog hit the pavement and he removed round shaded glasses
from his aquiline nose, he thought he was boss, in his lounging look
to make his daughter look foolish for overdressing comparatively.
Wrong father, she hissed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Chef
Timothy had five grills smoking from Giga-carrot in the rec area of
the track. The King shut the covers and apprehended the cook too
late, the aroma of his most despised food permeating castle grounds.
It was totally forgotten then. A purple toad careened into the
caravan with a clarinet, performing until the King plugged his ears
and a guard made the Lester choke on the woodwind. The next setback
was less hands on, but all the more calamitous. When Joseph applied,
he assured Peach he could do anything any other toad could except
hear. That was an undersell. He irrigate everything. Muddy here,
nipper plants thriving there. King had to put up with a slow narrow
windy path or get soiled- no other options! He tapped his foot
halfway at a rock in the way, too heavy for guards to move.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">How
am I. To get. Across this?!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Touch

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
am! I left my palace. At your request. Did I not?&rdquo; He cut
across the weeds dirt patches to be upon her in moments, mockingly
amiable. &ldquo;Lovely decor. My daughter. Also I can see. How the
Earl won that. Silver, Thursday.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A L emblem
kart flew off the rainbow dropping from the clouds. Peach and most of
the guards and nobles braced for the big splash in the moat. Made of
cardboard it floated to the top again with the occupants. Luigi and
Toad swam out, dazed as Peach ran over and hugged them like mad.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Show
him your parcel and get em outta here,&rdquo; Toad advised, quietly.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another emergency going on and-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Grinning
impishly, The King let a long scroll unroll. Peach about launched to
the second moon in the sky. </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">How

infusing your wicked ideas in other lands. I beseech you to dissolve
your reign and live the rest of your days HERE under my supervision,
lest I ruin you? I am losing control of my institutions. I am losing
Mario. I have little left, so I am more than willing to go back on my

around in the air a scepter next.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A ball of
light lifted over stunned faces and settled on an empty green plot,
many acres wide, adjacent to castle grounds and the racetrack. The
yard sparkled.</font></p>

back on that too. You will be one under MY supervision!&rdquo;</font></p>

was never scratched off the paperwork.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">This
family. Earl?&rdquo; The King stepped to the side and clones of Mr.
Toad, down to the lack of gender indicators, absent entirely on toads
of that pedigree, arrived from the leisure route.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">While
their black and gold robes matched the King, their demeanor differed,
skittishly ogling everything, including their long lost descendant.
His eldest sibling, the Duke spoke up.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Earl,
we only wish we could rewind our drastic reaction to your behavior.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
fought against the jellification of his legs, &ldquo;Y-yeah I
figured. Hey just- over here- uh please.&rdquo; He motioned to be
followed around the castle some.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There
was much pressure from the King, allies, other lofty ones,&rdquo;
Duke elaborated, other Toads nodding as they trailed the two leading
aristocrats. &ldquo;Forgive us.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mr. Toad
kept his hands in his soggy pockets as they approached a barricade of
downed trees. Since the Pillar of Understanding incident, the erosion
of the hills made it impossible to reach the back yard that way and
he knew that, hitting a dead-end mentally as physically.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Look,
you left me in a bad place. I somehow picked myself up and I forgive
you, for my own sanity at least, but I just don&rsquo;t get it..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
were devastated!&rdquo; They exclaimed. &ldquo;</font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We</font></em>
<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">are a line
with .0001% variance. You were given the name Toad to be the paragon
of us folks, Earl.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mr. Toad
sighed out years of frustration, his family flinching when he swung
around from the foliage. &ldquo;Nature managed to carve out a &lsquo;freak&rsquo;
like me that&rsquo;s attracted to humans, males, despite me being
ostensibly so, with a crush on one in particular with a mustache- oh
and two first names. Deal with it. You can selectively breed to make
us look as identical as you want but you can&rsquo;t regulate our
personalities, behaviors, and preferences like that. That just makes
you an ass-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Something
blew the heck up, so close, their ears rang. As pine cones and bits
of bark rattled from the blast rain over them, Toad rose first, his
blanched face glowing from orange flames.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Frantic
guards scuttled downhill to Royal Raceway, the blimp on fire. Luigi&rsquo;s
kart, or the one the Vrlrdyi Scope conjured, had drifted downstream
where the C-4 was triggered from ambers of Tim&rsquo;s fiery grills.
Precisely why one does not totally ignore such.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">At the

<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Up

Toadsworth had been all along it seemed. He unquestionably missed
nothing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad, in a
new change of clothes, steeled himself for the lashing, tapping on
the door. &ldquo;K. Right here, Toadsworth.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">If

myself, good chap!&rdquo;</font></p>

hierarchy has not chosen an unorthodox suitor since Princess Mush IV.
You may have boarded the infamous </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Difficulties
Ahead</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">,
but you can handle it, I am equally certain.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
silently thanked the stars. The general reaction from staff of &lsquo;okay
whatever bro&rsquo; to everything he unfettered all he ever wanted.
They were going to have to kick the housekeeping up a notch though,
the lobby only marginally cleaned up from when Mr. Zeror used a
jackhammer (sounded epic, which he could have seen it) to break into
the basement.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">..Don&rsquo;t
cry, it&rsquo;s&hellip;Quite alright. You will be an excellent
chancellor.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
feared that's what that eye burning sensation was as he stared at his
reflection in the polished checkerboard tiles. &ldquo;Thanks&hellip;
Now. Did anyone take the furniture out of that secret slide room?
You&rsquo;ve been echoing like crazy&hellip;Sam? &rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He dared
press into the pitch black room, a strong sour musk within. He
smacked the light switch. The olive green throw Toadsworth was known
to snuggle with had a lump under it, deep in the room the three
stained glass panels watching over.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
ripped the cover from the moldy, brown spotted, curled, white haired
toad, dry for some time. He staggered back, tripping over himself.
&ldquo;Stars! What happened to you Samuel??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Master
Toad.. Tell no one of my body. The Jewel of the Stars, the
Toadstool&rsquo;s tool to puppet toads for centuries, was right here
in our basement until a friend became a Judas!&rdquo; the disembodied
voice cried. &ldquo;Strike him down and retrieve it before the Jewel
of Stars meets its rival, the other Jewel of Stars!&rdquo;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
squawking goonies drove the snaggle toothed officer up a wall. Not a
Pushy-Wall or 'Bomp', a relative to whomps like him, a.. Never mind.
Mid day Water Land was plagued with goop, unpredictable tides
endangering land dwellers. It was rumored that Ice Land was melting,
though he hardly gave attention to that when he was busy with local
reports of property damage and injuries. Being of Snifit Patrol, not
the Sumeet Snufit himself, his executive decision was to delay
tedious paperwork that didn't ever help anyone. Reading a wooden sign
in kanji, arrows spanning four ways, he righted it, uncovering a
missed goop splotch.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sergeant
Howie whistled for one of the orange jumpsuited inmates. The toad
obsequiously hosed around with the dubious 'F.L.A.U.D.' (Flash
Longitudinally Articulating Utility Drencher) on his back, no Gadd
seal of approval on it to be found. The onerous clean up was up to
the imitations, what the other toads were using when Yellow Toad
rejoined them, spraying water in neat lines over where the beach and
deep jungle greens intertwined.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Can
we discuss the Elle in the room? Aside from us being convicts,&quot;
Yellow spoke up.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The Toad
Brigade met in a shady spot willingly, if skeptically, by The
Captain's folding arms.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Bill,
we know Stan is your father's youngest brother of nine and you
weren't introduced until the Berlin Byways fell in your adulthood.
What I'm asking.. why are you so close to him that... I mean, why do
you allow him to profit from your impulse disorder?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Banktoad
jolted like he was spat, or sprayed in the face. &quot;J&ouml;rg,
come on. If you're Mr. Psychic you know I was kicked out of home. I
would have dropped out of school if Stanley and I didn't meet. I told
him 'look I'm messed up'. I do stuff like this subconsciously..&quot;
They gawked when the green toad materialized a heavy set of gold keys
to a boat. &quot;And he was like-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;William,
you are the best!&quot; The Captain unstrapped his FLAUD, holding
them high over his head as he beamed at his nephew. &quot;Let us
depart and find the Darklandian Jewel of the Stars.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Excuse
me.. Um. I don't mean to give severance - I mean I promised to assist
Parakarry tackle the holiday rush, but aside from that I like the
ideal of this job, I just don't think how we're going about it is-
uh, right.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
Captain froze, vexingly. &quot;Pardon?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The purple
toad lifted his focus from his sand caked boots, boring into him with
the faintest of embers. &quot;I.. well I did stutter, but you
understood! I will not be a disgrace, not professionally nor in our-
or my old community. Zechariah was heartbroken when he heard about
us, you know, my mission partner back there-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Ah.
So it's religion, the same reason Miss Toadette had to fill in for
you once.&quot; The Captain airily swung the keys around his finger.
&quot;Do you know what you two have in common?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Captain,
Mail's eleemosynary and proselytizing work aside, even I agree that
taking a recess for treasure would be unwise!&quot; Hint argued.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Two
foot, three inch difference, identical BMI,&quot; The Captain
chuckled. &quot;That's all I was going to say. I know because I
touched them... And by touching Heinemann, or specifically the
Lexicon pdf on his phone, but yes his body too I suppose, I know that
the treasure in Dark Land is the key to unlimited, world changing
power-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;That
you'll never get.&quot; Banktoad ripped the key from him, pocketing
it. &quot;This is because I love you. Trust me.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
devastation on their leader could only be compared to how he might
look if his accounts were wiped clean. The red toad keeled over into
some bushes, gagging. When his mini break down was over and he
whipped around, aiming an over-pressured rocket nozzle, he was only
threatening some of the brigade.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The high
tide polluted anew by shifting waters, the yellow toad on the dock
found it all futile. Another sat at the edge with him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hey.
If this brigade thing is done for, umm, you are welcome to visit
Zechariah's apiary. You wouldn't have to convert or work the bees
even, there's just have a lot of unsolved mysteries in the fringes of
Mushroom territories if you recall.&quot; He added in hush, leaning
in, &quot;They'd pay handsomely, being exempt from Kingdom taxes..&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yellow
Toad pat the purple spotted mailman's shoulder, getting in return a
rarely seen smile. &quot;My ramshackle plots so far make me hesitate
to lend my expertise, but thanks.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Why
wasn't my offer to lecture there accepted?&quot; Hint Toad stood in
the gap between them. Yellow was silently annoyed, or more annoyed
rather that 'four eyes' ruined their moment.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;They
don't need someone redolent of a dialogue box, Hint,&quot; Mail
answered patiently. &quot;Are you with us or them?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He paused.
&quot;The empath is the most elusive talent under the psychic
umbrella,&quot; Hint dodged excellently. &quot;That doesn't count as
an example and to be objective, not captious, if we've slumped this
far Yellow Toad must be insufficiently trained at it. &quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
'empath' stopped staring at oily waters, standing up. &quot;No
Heinemann, I can't lift you in the sky, make heads explode, or
anything cool, just be a voyeur to people's effed up emotions and
dreams.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;That
has to be torturing when you, uh, put it that way.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His scowl
melted, facing the mailman. &quot;It's quite scary Mordecai, though
</font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">thrilling</font></em>
<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">might be the
better word.&quot; He pointed out the cop over there. In a white and
blue hammock tied between two bowed out trees, the newspaper over
Sergeant Howie's head rippled from snoring. &quot;Watch.&quot;</font></p>
<p><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~..Sergeant
Howard Nurikabe.. 58. From Shroom City. He placed third in a national
triathlon twenty years ago! The only remaining from Snifit Patrol's
original squad, joining initially to escape the humdrum of being a
seasonal obstacle on Bowser's golf course. He actually hates Bowser.
And evil. Don't ever mistake him for a 'baddie' or think he's too old
for action. Not with someone in danger RIGHT NOW&hellip;</font></em> 
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yellow
Toad trailed, swaying as the whomp sprung off the hammock, slapped
his cap on, and barreled towards him. An orange capped toad women
convict, Nass T was struggling in the swells, and Yellow was in the
way, trampled by the cop and knocked into the murky water with a huge
splash. Mailtoad dove agilely after him, his 'Level One Snorkel-Toad
Certification' coming in handy. Just as his arm graced Yellow's, a
siren, or something with red eyes and a big finned tail slapped them
towards an activated underwater pipe, sucking up the toads. While
Hint Toad sprinted down the dock wailing for help, it went black for
the yellow and purple toads in the depths.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">In
hindsight the trip was rife with danger. At least neither of them
were rookies. Peach and Mushroom King finessed around downed trees
all the way to the jagged precipice, rewarded with a stunning view of
the kingdom and restoring soul star bits, even if reduced to the
slightest drizzle.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Side by
side, he faced her sharply. &quot;Whom were you. Engaged to?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
quietly exhaled. &quot;Like it matters now&hellip; Fine. Princess
Daisy of Sarasaland.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Ho
ho.. I approve.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Do
not humor me, father. Why, sure! And there is no possibility that
your minions are covertly following us.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Of
course not,&quot; he retorted in kind. &quot;Same for you!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The jig
up, King's guards rustled bushes stepping out, worse for wear from
being unadapted to the lower gravity. Luigi's entrance was his
bruised up body flailing in the air from the big boo that launched
him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He rolled
against the King and princess's feet, opening his bloodshot eyes.
&quot;Run!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">King Boo
pushed apart two indigo trees. His blue flames made the guards
scatter like ant-troopers under a microscope as he directed his glare
to the Toadstools. &quot;Bwa ha ha ha! Stranded in your unimpressive
city I have amassed your worst nightmare. COMMENCE MY ARMY!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Seemingly
every tree in the forest shook at once. Luigi had climbed up by then,
sputtering to Peach that his old foe had arrived a minute ago
exactly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~&ldquo;We..were..never..yours,
eh...Now &hellip;move&hellip;you&hellip;fatty!&rdquo; the hidden army
droned.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hoards of
mummy-mes were unleashed. Pummeled, Peach was pulled away from her
plumber pal, their hands gracing, just not enough. Swept forward she
couldn&rsquo;t miss the mummy toads forcing her father down the
bottomless abyss. He caught a branch, the monsters leaping into the
void to take him down with them. One spunkier than the others, landed
on his shoulders and squeezed thick his neck, strangling the mushroom
ruler until he was blue than the glow of the sacred land.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Huddled
helplessly, she desperately petitioned to the stars, sobbing,
begging, again and-</font></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
cannot make that wish, killer. You are under another contract with
us..&rdquo;</font></em> 
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~No. I
never wanted his life. Only.. to ruin his hateful influence. That is
all.. I just want him back. Please.</font></p>
<p><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Forget
the man you hate. I can get your MOTHER back-</font></em> 
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What? Her
heart just. Burst.</font></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
of a trade? Enter the depths and become the princess of the only
galaxy you deserve to rule&hellip; NO? You don&rsquo;t trust me? Ha
ha ha. You had a chance to use the wish I can furnish. Now that you
forfeit, everything will be stripped from you, including the calm of
death.&rdquo;</font></em> 
</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The next
sensation for the blond princess, she was on her side, being slid
from the edge by a human, rough enough to scrape her up some and ruin
the gown. Daisy. She made it. She finally made it. Overwhelmed she
leapt into the other princess's arms. Her father was rescued it
appeared, laying tiredly on a stretcher, guards surrounding. Some of
her toads and Luigi was there, also some mummy-mes and King Boo.. not
entirely banished but captured in various ways. Slowly, it felt like
the nightmare was ending.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yo.
I'm back baby, and as my myself! &quot; Daisy's voice was hoarse yet
riveting. &quot;Well... that won't make sense. Long story. Actually
short story: we couldn't rewind, but.. we don't need to anymore
right? Peachy?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Continuing
to peer over the other princess's shoulder, the pink slowly realized
she was never leaning on her side. Star Hill was crumbling apart with
them on it, starbits flying from the chasm. They were washed down
into town and it didn't stop there.</font></p>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
Koopa led the scatter from the trouncing ogre faced beasts. Tripping
up, Larry found himself pinned against a sloping altar. With a crash
louder than a doomship backfiring, his world went black. He wasn&rsquo;t
smashed to smithereens but trapped either way.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Heeeeeelp!!&rdquo;
He walloped the tox box&rsquo;s interior walls. To feel better,
sorta, he remembered it was common for princes to need rescue
actually. They were vulnerable and as valuable a bargaining chip as a
princess, it only didn&rsquo;t make headlines at the request of said
distressed dudes.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...Got
ya bro!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The teen
fist pumped.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-For
five bucks.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wtf,&rdquo;
Larry grumbled.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Just
kiddin. HUHGH!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Roy pried
one side up enough for Larry to snake under with a hushed little
&lsquo;thanks&rsquo;. The lava from the fortress towers were on their
bare heels when they joined the others clanging against and shaking a
closed barbed fence.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
ordered, &ldquo;Punch it on three!.. 123! Go!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Their
combined punch flipped the fence around on the pivot, flinging the
five face first on the frigid sidewalk. Karts with ridiculously tiny
red roller wheels screeched on the street, and nightcrawlers, ninjis,
gloombas, and eeries ogled at the oozing lava show, steaming fiercely
against the continual wintry mix in the area. Under that commotion
Lemmy sprung up and shoved everyone into the across the street
mailing center subsidiary where the staff appeared to be out.
Relieved, Lemmy scratched a new number on his hand drawn watch,
surreally drawn to a crumpled holoflash present box at the top of the
iron bins around.</font></p>
<p><em>&rsquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">From:

in...</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Drats!
I mean.. We didn&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wasn&rsquo;t
born yesterday, Lem.&rdquo; She advanced out of the shadows, waltzing
around in soggy fuzzy slippers. With a mix matched purple sleeping
gown under that coat, she&rsquo;d dressed in a hurry they noticed,
and not as an insult to her for once.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wendy?&rdquo;
they chorused.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~One

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sis,&rdquo;
Lemmy began, suspiciously.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">None
of this is for the lulz, okay?? The fortress is, like, gutted. Walls,
insulation, leaving only support beams after that thwomp worker left.

plenty more tips that the corporations don't want ya to know.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
rolled some quip on the back of his tongue before some DK bongos in
the unclaimed goods pile distracted him. The distaff koopaling was
thus saved from disapprobation, the rest of her brother's eyes
gleaming at free stuff. Bowser Junior found a Gaddget imitation
&lsquo;Spastic Painbrush&rsquo;, sloshing Morton&rsquo;s freshly
plucked obscure magazines. While they were chasing each other Roy
settled on a book of all things with a label taped to the cover.
(Seriously, who does that?)</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Usin'

to some lame mathcore song?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wendy
twisted the cover around. &lsquo;Rocks: What they are and where to
find them'. &ldquo;Brother, it&rsquo;s a petrology textbook you are
blatantly looting. Heh, and MY business prospects are sooo debased.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wendy,
welcome aboard but don&rsquo;t say I stole because I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
Lemmy corrected, spinning the bombsketball on his finger. &ldquo;This
had my name on it.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And
this has mine!&rdquo; She grabbed an arm full of foundation in a
faded box, recalled for allergic reactions akin to the Power Balloon
treatment. This was a look folks paid for current day though, not to
mention recycled for sustainability!</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Work
that grift, queen!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Indeed,
cheat and obfuscate the ESRG for even more business funding,&rdquo;
Morton accused, finger wagging. &ldquo;You are literally worse than
those Shufflegate toads!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lunging at
Roy and Morton, Wendy slipped in Junior&rsquo;s paint, colliding into
the bins. It was like the cymbal clash to the beat Larry was tapping
at the moment.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~You
can call me L4rry, or call me king. Got 0.9144 meters, not ta be

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wendy rose
from the pile, face completely powdered out as Roy and Morton hacked
with laughter. &ldquo;Disgusting and low vibrational. Stop!!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
song&rsquo;s just about those wands we used to use!&rdquo; he spat
back. &ldquo;Tho, you right. It&rsquo;s corny with conversions and
math and junk. Overhearin those night school classes is cramping my
style.&rdquo; (Roy suddenly hid the textbook behind his shell.)</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Everybody,
enough! Stop telling our sister what to do!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Roy sized
his older yet littler brother up. &ldquo;So you can tell us what ta
do?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yes.&rdquo;
Lemmy spat himself with some camouflaging dark blue paint. &ldquo;Wait
outside. Peacefully.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lava
draining down sewer grates allowed spectators and him rolling on the
bombsketball to get closer before going Koopa Jordan. Poor gift in
postal purgatory, he lamented, lining up the shot with one eye
closed. It was time to adopt the Festive Tree Day spirit in the month
of Yam and be charitable.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mr.
Steinblock appreciated the increased maneuverability from the last
minute renovations, but that unclearable until next morning molten
rock was an accelerant for trouble in the form of rubbernecking
citizens as the rugs and curtains.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Crash! A
sizzling object burst through some. As the spindel rolled away from
the reception desk, several blue ribbon wearing whomps left the
elevator too late to toss it back. Ka-boom! Adjacent buildings lost
their windows, park cars were smashed in, and the block was coated in
glass from the pancaking explosion, driving all but six of the
witnesses away.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lem,&rdquo;
Roy sputtered in the dust, patting Lemmy&rsquo;s shell. &ldquo;Ya
went Banzai bill on em! Noice!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
was only trying to blow the doors off..&rdquo; Lemmy shifted his
weight uneasily. &ldquo;Anyway.. Uh.. Search the rubble!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Just
try it kid.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Steinblock
dislodged from a portion that revealed that the entire top floor
remained intact. Thwomps and whomps gunned out for them from there or
rose from the debris piles. Roy made KoopaBall defensive and
offensive plays back to back with Morton. Larry snatched the latter&rsquo;s
dropped magazines to make ninja stars, striking down the baddies the
&lsquo;Thunder Brothers&rsquo; would soften up first. Junior&rsquo;s
brush uncontrollably spewed chocolate colored goop on all surfaces,
hindering everyone really, until Lemmy actually noticed him for once
and turned that around, blinding foes with the paint. Wendy chased
down the cylindrical creature that dared to claim she couldn&rsquo;t
read paperwork. Petty, but he was slow and easily caught. The powder
from the pallet slapped in his face made him sneeze and bang against
a leaning wall. It sent others down with and suddenly the princess
was facing into a roofless golden office. A wood panel fragment with
ghostly hints of plaques was the backdrop of Mayor Koton,
aggressively circling something in a tattered book with a nub of a
pencil.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
dropped out. Leave.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No
way.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Koton
looked up, a comparatively iridescent middle spike on his head
catching the Boo Moon light just right. &ldquo;Yes you will,
sweetheart.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
distaff koopaling understood the breadth of his power then, compelled
to leave against her will. Thank G.O. and D. Lemmy dropped in then,
interrupting his scheme by stepping over the flipped shelves to
approach the desk at eye level.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Great
job sis. So Mr. Mayor. Hi, we&rsquo;re.. You know who we are. Sorry
it came to this. I know you&rsquo;re expecting me to justify it right
away and make you deal with it when we leave, but that&rsquo;s not
how.. I operate I guess.&rdquo; He held out his paw optimistically.
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the deal. We really need the Jewel of the Stars
to save the world and stuff, but we&rsquo;ll pay you what it&rsquo;s
worth and fix your building if you help us with that. I pinky
promise. I know you don&rsquo;t have fingers either but-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He stared
at him like prey. &ldquo;-General Lemmy of the Koopa Troop offering a
business deal to me, arbiter of Neo Bowser City, epicenter of all
independent thinkers in Dark Land??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
inhaled. &ldquo;Umm. Yes?-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Just
like your uncle..&rdquo; The thwimp mused to himself, mellowing as he
detached the spike, leaving himself with a reverse mohawk. &ldquo;He
was blithe like you, strongly principled, but let fear or pressure to
conform ebb that away. Very well. You may &lsquo;rent&rsquo; that for
now.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy slid
the heavy gem closer, sobered. &ldquo;..Thanks, Mr. Mayor. What will
you do in the meantime?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The thwimp
hopped out of his chair into rubble, facing the street as he laughed,
&ldquo;Get outta dodge!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The World
8 Big Tanks blocked every sprawling route. The rocky wrenches allowed
the bruised whomps and thwomps, and the mayor as Lemmy lost track of
him, get away from the disaster zone but advanced so that the
koopalings were rounded up in the center at cannon point. Lemmy knew
his well of provisory leader&rsquo;s luck would run empty at a time
like this, stumped and sweating bullets rivaling the size about to be
shot at them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A lazy
image of Ludwig appeared on the barrel of the closest tank with a
book, as precariously as he did that kinda thing on airships. &ldquo;Tell
me you are not defeated already,&rdquo; he snorted.&rdquo;Tsk!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
shocked something out of Lemmy, waggling, &ldquo;No Luddy, however
I&rsquo;m seeing you. I-I&rsquo;m just out of tools!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Reevaluate.
Who is missing?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A split
second later, they all heard a call of &lsquo;FIRE&rsquo;.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&hellip;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Brace!&rdquo;
the purple capped one warned in the face of choppy dusk waters.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He and the
yellow toad crashed upon the shore of a jungly environment. Bus sized
ant troopers abandoned the hill they plowed into and climbed up moss
covered trees that vanished into the stormy clouds, the roars of
camouflaged creatures shaking the foliage. A troop of mega goombas
burst out, chasing the scampering orange clad toads inland until they
made their best, short legged, leap across a murky river. The goombas
smirked to each other and backed off, thunder cackling. Finally the
purple toad had the opportunity to pull off the snorkel and
pragmatically, the thick inmate uniform as well in favor of his
thinner white undershirt, clinging to his abs. The yellow less in
shape toad stopped staring. Nonetheless the emergency tracker in
their kit led them to the most hostile kingdom to be in late evening.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Mordecai..Schei&szlig;e.
This is belated. Sorry,&rdquo; Yellow spoke up. &ldquo;In my hubris I
thought I&rsquo;d honed in the psionic abilities I&rsquo;ve only
known I had since the brigade split up and I got myself checked out
by a nose, foot, elbow, and brain specialist in Dinosaur Land..&rdquo;
He took another breath. &ldquo;Obviously not. I&rsquo;ll take an L as
big as Stan and in the meantime, thanks for saving me from my idiocy.
I could kiss you right now.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mailtoad
flushed. &ldquo; You&rsquo;re welcome, but -&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I'm
joshing! We&rsquo;d better.. Hurry along shouldn't we?&rdquo; Yellow
Toad did just that..</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The threat
of super sized dangers, slithering wigglers, and razor toothed
piranha plants increased the deeper into the jungle they went,
following the river while avoiding viscous mud and man eating frogs..
It was survival time, in more ways than one.-</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Were
you really being farcical, J&ouml;rg? I wasn&rsquo;t uncomfortable or
anything, just curious,&rdquo; He shrugged frankly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Before any
hero moments Yellow low-key fancied Mailtoad&rsquo;s &lsquo;quiet
dignity and strength of character&rsquo; - that was to be referential
of Madame Flurrie, not to mention the physique born of rush
deliveries and working off season at the apiary.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Yes
and no. Princesses do that all the time when saved. I&rsquo;m aware
princes not so much, and it&rsquo;s moot when I&rsquo;m neither but
it&rsquo;s..The principle I guess. Okay fine and I think you&rsquo;re
hot,&rdquo; he admitted, brushing his bicep.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thank
you!&rdquo; he beamed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Indeed
with that cleared up, they could focus on the weather doing the
opposite. Lightning flashed heavy rains drenched them all over again,
as if they chose to take a dip in the skeeter and apparently shark
infested river. Yellow took a closer look at a dorsal fin crossing
by.</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Nothing
good ever lasts, as we all know,&rsquo; squeaked the matriarch of the
inland pod.</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-I
didn&rsquo;t know, Miss Daphne.&rsquo; The dolphin in the rear caught
up. &lsquo;I was called in for emergency lifeguarding at the Seaside
Kingdom earlier.&rsquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The family
spyhopped to look at the runt like an idiot. He got that alot, the
only of the Alderson pod that intermingled regularly with the
non-marine world.</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
were that close to the edge of the Earth??&rsquo; the gold ribbon
wearing daughter of the leader, Dora snapped.</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Why..
Sure. That&rsquo;s not what I asked.&rsquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She rolled
her eyes through those goggles. &lsquo;The CIA conspired against our
fabulous queen Wendy O., okay? Get with the program, Donald. They&rsquo;re
prohibited in Big Island.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
scientists that monitor us with satellites, not the government,
moron!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Huh?&rsquo;</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Nothing
ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo; the bilingual cetacean muttered.</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Perfect,
darling,&rsquo; the leader jumped back in. &lsquo;So in case you were
ABSENT for this too, a Fish Bone found a Spear Guy village! They&rsquo;re
about to sacrifice four toads that look like those gawking cityboys!&rsquo;</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yes
ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; Donald cruised atop the water momentarily,
apathetic to Yellow Toad reeling back from the edge. &lsquo;One day
they&rsquo;ll understand what waterfalls are...&rsquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-We
have to hurry!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yellow
clambered on a hanging vine to swing away quicker, but Mailtoad
remained on the ground waving at him. There were ukikis on the vines
too, veering it with their weight to the side and then abandoning it
before Yellow smacked against a beached steam powered cruiser. He
slid off the rusted hull as Mailtoad ran over though the mud,
stepping on a solid part.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Huh??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">An
unnaturally blocky part rose from the earth. &ldquo;Thank Eldstar.
Listen-&rdquo; Sergeant Howie coughed up gravel, a bigger crack in
the whomp&rsquo;s back than there was supposed to be. &ldquo;Yer off
the hook for everything, got it? We were combing the sea for ya
before pirates took over. Wouldn&rsquo;ta succeeded if your brigade
didn&rsquo;t distract me with this ebook, see. Taking advantage of my
multilingual abilities!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Officer,
are you sure you&rsquo;re okay-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
am!&rdquo; he shook Mailtoad, &ldquo;Not the hostages.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yellow
staggered up, fighting the headache. &ldquo;I know. The dolphins
mentioned it.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The cop
spun to him. &ldquo;You talk to animals, boy?? And I&rsquo;m crazy?
Nevermind- shh!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peeking
around the bow, the officer spied on some Giant Spear Guys
downstream. One shined around a headlamp while another attempted to
fill up a F.L.A.U.D. The third one, a guard armed with, in addition
to a spear, a pickaxe with a distinctive chip in the steel tied above
the grass skirt, idly thumbed through a leather postman&rsquo;s
satchel. As he tossed junk mail, Mailtoad welled with rage. That was
no one&rsquo;s call but the intended recipient!</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Whoa
nelly, cadet!..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mailtoad
stopped crunching tree bark subconsciously and observed with the
others how the trio retreated, rolled a random chomp rock over, and
activated a switch. The previously solid wall of tightly arranged
moss covered timbers lowered, revealing a torch lit village with
straw huts. The tracker&rsquo;s arrow aimed right in.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Now
go!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
dashed- or hobbled over before the timbers timed out and shot up,
sealing them in with the bustling area. Their stomachs churned while
sneaking behind huts. Masked natives were enraptured by dance and
tambourine, in denser numbers towards the granite rocks. The Captain,
Banktoad, Hint Toad, and Nass T. were individually tied to long
spears behind an amber glowing, pool sized cauldron. A stash of gold-
the brigade&rsquo;s was being melted in it under the direction of the
chief, distinguished by an elaborate red feathered headdress and
match horizontal stripes on his porcelain mask. The F.L.A.U.D. they
saw earlier was used to fill up a second big pot meanwhile, no
question of what was on the menu for that. The only delay for the
ceremony then was the downpour snuffing the fires. Nothing a
continual flow of matches couldn't fix&hellip;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">William..&rdquo;
The Captain&rsquo;s face was green. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t smelt
that garbage down soon enough!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Banktoad
glanced at his uncle exasperatedly, his single earring ravished.
Getting his ear pierced was the first thing he did after getting
kicked out of home, so he&rsquo;d rather be steam roasted with it
still in, vain as it seemed. Nass agreed, throwing a huge and
justifiable screechy fit when the normal sized Petal Guys found a
locket they&rsquo;d missed the first time, yanking it from her neck.
In retaliation from the kicks sustained, they lifted the pole with
her on it to the seasoning station, slathering the nurse with strange
leaves and stinky herbs. The men&rsquo;s protests got them pummeled
with fresh tomatoes.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-I
can&rsquo;t watch folks with a misdemeanor at most go through this!&rdquo;
Sergeant Howie seethed. &ldquo;Wait for the cue, cadets.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He stepped
out into the open with a fixed default expression, as if one of the
types of slab beasts susceptible to the twilight hour, waiting for
the precise moment. He tipped on one villager who stumbled into
another and another. The domino pileup reached the chief, who shifted
so that the final one banged into the newly boiling cauldron. While
it didn't flip, much of it sloshed out, a tenuous white steam cloud
blinding many.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yellow and
Mailtoad burst out of the shadows to rip off knotted vines from the
brigade, rewarded with a hard stare back, like they were a mirage.
The hostages snapped out of it largely when the chief howled for
attack. The jungle shook from the stomps of villager bare feet on hot
slick granite. The Captain used his herculean strength to push away
one boulder, breaking a narrow way into the jungle again, but before
he got started on another, a barrage of lances scattered the toads
like micro goombas in a haystack. The Captain climbed onto one of the
railed platforms moving side to side for a breather, a chaotic
skirmish beneath his single boot. Hint Toad&rsquo;s ebook reader with
the forbidden rites was long gone at this point, but as a blessing,
or curse fit to be distributed by black chest inhabitants, he
remembered all of the five phases the officer rather impressively
translated.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">IOILNDCARET
AILTCOON EOROOCMMD!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With a
brilliant flash brighter than his stolen headgear, a purple capped
white spotted &lsquo;DLC&rsquo; doppelganger of Captain Toad
materialized on the platform.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ready
for adventure!&rdquo; The copy&rsquo;s gleaming smile broadened as he
dropped into the fray and flung his pickaxe at the nurse's kidnappers
sneaking away. It tore through the first two pedal guys, stopping and
embedded in the spine of the third. The three dropped dead, coating
the nurse in gore, while the clone trotted about hacked and slashed
with a field knife.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There
are no truer words than, you have met the enemy, and it is you,&rdquo;
The Captain said with almost self reflection.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Banktoad
indignantly appeared under the platform, wanting to kill him. &ldquo;A
DHIUEASSMN EX,&rdquo; he uttered instead.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A snapshot
was taken, pausing the world. In the void of the universe, the photo
was valley folded once, opened again, the top corners creased, and
the sides folded one last time. A cosmic force propelled the
completed paper airplane through the rest of the interdimensional
sea.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Brother,
you sure were acting pretty evil, ya know, taking advantage of folks
suffering DID, inciting violence against your own kinfolk, coercion
on princesses, grave robbing, and lying on medical discharge
documents, to be good all along as you claim.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
didn&rsquo;t say I was &lsquo;good&rsquo; babe,&rdquo; he snipped,
strapped in the backseat. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s too simplistic to
describe my project since my accident. I&rsquo;ve worked and
sacrificed nonstop to put me exactly where I am right now. K, maybe I
flew too close to the sun at times with that method acting but-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
brother!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Exactly,
mon ami.&rdquo; Bond ended that unexciting but highly important
headset call with a mysterious person. &ldquo;That hatred you had for
toads and humans was real, and please stop plagiarizing the madam&rsquo;s
book reports as well.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Vermin..&rdquo;
Kylie Koopa&rsquo;s papers were quickly sealed away from prying,
beady eyes. If she wasn&rsquo;t tin foil hatted, no telling what else
he would have stolen.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
wasn&rsquo;t, Bond. My magnum opus, the final Weegee report that&rsquo;ll
crack open every secret known to man is written out already in my
head. Years from now they&rsquo;ll be studying my posthumous
discoveries in Mystery Land! My psychic defenses are up so you </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">can&rsquo;t</font></em>
<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">understand!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Aye
aye aye. Regardless, you&rsquo;re paying for terrorizing Princess
Peach and you will never see her again.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Will
I? And thank God you didn&rsquo;t say irregardless.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">This
will be the only time we agree on something.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No
it won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Mitch corrected smugly, getting out of a
rebuttal as the dark warp pipe ejected the Lexus into a bright
naturalistic environment with tightly packed cottages and precipitous
dips where the mist settled, shortly coasting to an inn.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jelectro
had an urgent appointment, leaving Kylie Koopa with the kart, the
first Mushroomite in modern record deported for tyranny, and of
course the story she was going to write on that. Nervous jitters
remained after the noki spy rendezvous with a utility cart driving
janitor and left, but she&rsquo;d consumed an energy bar earlier and
was up for any fight &lsquo;that ol Mitch&rsquo; might put up. He
plopped into the wheelchair and knocked on his own.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A caramel
skinned sky blue spotted toad answered lackadaisically like. &ldquo;-Oh..
The clean up dude? Really?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Really,&rdquo;
Mitch winked.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And
erm, parole officer,&rdquo; Kylie waved from further back.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">*sigh*
Ciri, alert our King again!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They were
led by another more skittish Skylandian through the town, scorched
black from a jet powered kart. Besides that, there were remnants of
Koopa Troop paraphernalia from yesterday, cannons, and brickwork, and
flags and whatnot, the green draining the further they went. It
wasn&rsquo;t that Bowser funk killing all that was live and healthy
however. In the copy flower farm ahead reside an half embedded, four
story tall, golden phanto mask with an especially exaggerated evil
grin. None of the holes could be seen through what should be a hollow
entity and by the whispers of locals, anyone who dared to travel a
mile down and peek on the other side either didn&rsquo;t come back or
were too shocked to speak about it. Kylie&rsquo;s hasty reach for the
camera and failure to snap a picture of it, confirmed her worst fear.
The Skylandians farmers remaining wouldn&rsquo;t step any closer. It
was too Special.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Camoztar
escaped the Blue Falcon in the fertile soil here, literally with the
natural onyx looking mineral underground,&rdquo; the wheelchair bound
toad said, thick eyebrows lowering. &ldquo;We havta get it outta
here.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
reporter dropped the DSLR. &ldquo;How the heck, Mitch?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A soldier
snuck up and confiscated Kylie&rsquo;s camera. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
publicize this!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They were
forced into the cloudy village with the restless others eager to
investigate, frustrated more by the flock of confused para-beetles
swinging low and bumping them around. Kylie got off her shell,
finding the rival journalist missing. Calming down, she scanned left
and right..</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Try
up, babe.&rdquo; Mitch smirked, looking down from the windmill. He
wheeled away from the ledge the winged koopas helped him reach. He
could not reach the floating red &ldquo;!&rdquo; block in the center
of the room though, so maybe he shouldn&rsquo;t have forced her to
chase him... This edifice was constructed of the same rune inscribed
glossy black substance the fated obelisk was one of the aerial
structures that survived the plunge.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Who&rsquo;s
up here?? Halt.&rdquo; A warrior class toad came up stairs, sneezing
right away from the dust.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Listen,
you&rsquo;ll die soon if you keep at this, Ciri. You&rsquo;ll never
retire to the Cascade Kingdom like you want, so give me the low down
instead dude. &rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Though
they had the dagger pressed against his neck, under the jaw, they
were the one shaking. Mitch didn&rsquo;t get offended from people
being terrified of him anymore; it&rsquo;s how he got syndicated
early in his career. Also why his parents tried to drown him when he
was two.. Having his time wasted however was never acceptable. When
the blade sunk deeper, an identical cut immaterially swiped across
theirs. Startled, Ciri dropped the weapon, letting Mitch shove them

was smashed to pieces, like the ice sculptures all over the place.
Should he run over, unchain that buster beetle, and use it to squeeze
that diddly clan out of the captain? Should he- Don&rsquo;t rack up
any more charges. Do this!. Duh, of course. He did what Jelectro
telepathically advised, poking the secret ticklish spot on Agent N&rsquo;s
belly button. The hoarse chuckles to follow ripped out a torrent of
boo diddlies. The agents regained control of their senses in time to
get swarmed as they inundated the mountainside, causing mass
pandemonium with the bumpty, chill bully, and snowman residents. Some
light cut through before they conglomerate into an Atomic Boo, the
offender Agent Toad. He wasn&rsquo;t hurting them, but from the
ground, holding N&rsquo;s head gently, Jelectro noticed it distracted
the boos so he ordered the agents to scramble back and follow the

back to the castle getting whittled away from Star Hills

educational opportunity ever. Though Toad was making a face, no one
stopped her so- &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why &lsquo;Samuel&rsquo; had a
human name before that was in vogue. It was scandalous of course, but
when the war ramped up and our princess was born, the Queen was able
to get Mr. Toadsworth away from the infantry and into the castle
without the purity tests.. He confessed in his letter to me that that
was never to be known before his death, so when this gets around to
him-&rdquo; </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">-The
nerve of that guy!&rdquo; Toad screamed at the back of the venal
banker. During that talking, what&rsquo;s supposed to be a free
action for the civilized, he&rsquo;d taken the gem and bolted towards
the disarrayed city. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Peach
encouraged the others to go ahead, noticing something odd about this
all. The Lakitu Bros and other pedestrians were approaching from the
famous big ramp, meaning there were no obstacles in the way of her
sneaking off via the pitstop lane. </span></font></span></em>

<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Oh

Daisy shook the hood off, unleashing that frizz of auburn hair. &ldquo;This
is only like that time I was on house arrest&hellip;Kidding. Umm.
What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">She

</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Daisy
was galvanized to hop in. They sped off, whippers on high to combat
the starbits. Citizens sheltered inside or pulled over so it was a
straight shot to the train station. Mostly. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">The

</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Daisy
broke out of the reverie, sitting up. &ldquo;Besides King B.- that&rsquo;s
my dad, blowing me up to come home for the weekend, don&rsquo;t I
talk too much and make everything worse? Can&rsquo;t forget that
cringy engagement story..&rdquo; </span></font></span></em>

<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">...Did

</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">You

</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">No,
it&rsquo;s.. s&rsquo;alright!&rdquo; she mimicked earnestly, badly
either way. &ldquo;That old headache of mine believed it is all that
matters.&rdquo; </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Pfft.

better. You don&rsquo;t need filters on your Tick-Tock Clock page
like those e-thots. All you need is that super modest magenta (kinda
old fashioned but it&rsquo;s good on you) swimsuit on the beach and
those round sparkle shades, oh and waving does the trick.&rdquo; </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Oh
Daisy,&rdquo; she replied, demurely. Peach had admirers and knew this
abjectly, though it hit different to hear it unfiltered, the way only
a hierarchical peer could deliver. -Or to be more honest with
herself, in a way only Daisy would because that was just her. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Snapping
back to her surroundings, she jabbed the break on purpose. A high
pitched whistle preceded the K64 shuffling under the station. Noting
waiting patrons, disappointment didn&rsquo;t cover it for Peach. Mr.
Zeror didn&rsquo;t have one confederate. Two. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">A
larger purple toad left the office first, clueless until the second,
a pink one tapped him. It was too late to run. Joe simply admitted
that his part in the scheme involved Chef Timothy living rent free in
his head as much as assisting that uppity Zeror. The heist would get
him attention.. Les&rsquo;s excuse involved no rancor, yet publicity
alike, wanting to see Gill T. and reunite classic rock band The
Keptos. Peach twirled a lock, listening. It had him comfortable
talking about it, all the while she knew all of her citizens and the
deceased too by name. Gill T., the Mario brother&rsquo;s neighbor was
dead. Fact checked, the large toad bolted off onto the starbit
powered sidewalk. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Yo,

cornering the remaining one pose to ask. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Peach
remembered her Sarasalandian friend was probably lost with half the
conversation in sign language. Joe communicated something to Daisy
she did understand, replying to the rude gesture by popping him. The
gardener flipped over the rail, off of the station and into bushes
below. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Daisy
stepped back flusteredly. &ldquo;Went nuclear, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;

</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Peach

<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Daisy
seized in place as the other princess planted a gentle kiss on her
cheek, the typical post rescue display of affection, but to Daisy
like the first blossoms of spring in Easton, the powerful rapids of
Muda, more knee buckling than the pyramids of Birabuto, more
breathtaking than soaring through the skies of Chai in a SkyPop&hellip;
When Peach&rsquo;s face was no longer brushing against her&rsquo;s,
separating governessy, the jet plunged beautifully, fiery crash
included. </span></font></span></em>

</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">The
princesses stumbled out onto Starman Lane where Mr. Zeror was on the
sidewalk, holding his lower abdomen and hacking up blood.
Eviscerated, a gelatinous blob left his throat, the bile from it
rolling down the soft slope, beyond Daisy&rsquo;s sneakers, and
underneath one additional legless viewer of the sick show. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">I

</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Peach
breathlessly twisted in the direction of Zoo S. Diddley, holding the
bag containing the Jewel of the Stars. Zoo confirmed he picked the
wrong word seeing her about to swat at him with the parasol but not
dodging with that knowledge. The dark boo was flung out into the
middle lane as Luigi, Toadette, Thomas, Chef Tim, and Mr. Toad
struggling a bit, caught up. Zoo had a flash of something, a lost
memory returning, overshadowed by the impulse to run. He sank
underground before a trio of plasma beams ripped it all up. Luigi
dropped his head to one area of the tar not melting as Bucken-Berry&rsquo;s
dragon form flew over. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">He

</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">He
jumped out of the way as the second blast blew up the spot he was on.
Dirt and concrete bits raining, the green plumber careen over to
investigate, seeing the strolling compartments below of the Toad Town
104, a cargo only locomotive. A spontaneous move unlike him, he
dropped down into the compartment of bananas. He heard several more
impacts behind him, followed by a &lsquo;we&rsquo;re okay!&rsquo;
that wasn&rsquo;t entirely believable. Regaining his bearings, it
gave him the courage to soldier on more than ever. During his short
stunt as official protector of all, inspiring them to launch into
danger so recklessly, but swiftly and resolutely made him feel like
his brother.</span></font></span></em></p>

</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">The
eighteen year old nerd propelled everyone up and away. The buildings
shrunk under their feet and bullet bills shot into the nothingness,
going off in a fireworks like array for the city. They flew over to
Bowser&rsquo;s New castle under a lovely scarlet sky, no Springo
Candy needed to clear the moat. No more rain or snow, no more KT
hostile bad guys, and no more trouble. Okay, a koopatrol instantly
ran down to report them but other than that- </span></font></span></em>

mounted behind his throne, jumbo gold filled treasure chests were on
sturdy shelves, territory maps were tacked up on the opposite side-
of which he could lawfully visit as a neutral, and the masonry of the
impending lava fountain the corner. There was a scantily filled
trophy case too, of course..a project for later. Peeling back his
diamond hard exterior, what brought him true joy was no longer the
conquest and demonstrations of militaristic prowess as satisfied
young Bowser. At the age of fifty-six and four months, it was family,

at T. Yoshisaur in his red parched lawn, motor rally helmet held
against his hip. Of course, with that cannon arm of his. Kamek still
ranted to this day. He and three other chumps had a four rider bike.
Goombario also shed the helmet, as did the poochy but not the
abnormally large koopa in a trench coat. He tried to pry it off,
failing. Oddly, Bowser began to sympathize. Those things weren&rsquo;t

because I&rsquo;m stupid enough to care.&rdquo; </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">His
slurred speech was convincingly venomous the same. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">No
you're not! Come on!&rdquo; Bowser argued. &ldquo;I shoulda vetted
more. Sorry.&rdquo; </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Keep

</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Well&hellip;You
always said to just kidnap you, though. Right?&rdquo; </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">He
sighed. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Sorry
again. I&rsquo;ll get to the point. I need to talk to you about
Clawdia.&rdquo; </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Mario
fizzled somewhat. That was as treacherous a topic as Bob-omb
Battlefield. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">The
war going south for us shafted the elites like her into the peasant
class. She was a cook at a camp I was running, overqualified, loved
numbers and very particular about random stuff. She was super fair
for instance. She sent gifts down to her cousins that were poorer,
perfectly even in value. If not she&rsquo;d send the difference in
coins. That kinda stuff. Relevant to us though she had the discipline
to ration the food. I was pissed off at first, but when my troop had
the energy to hold squads off because we all ate I got the point. You
know she could throw a spike ball better than a spike, too? Now, fast
forward to my shotgun crowning. You heard me. They tried to hide it,
I think not to sink or morale more, but they were so disappointed
they were left with me.&rdquo; </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">..That
was messed up,&rdquo; Mario said, air thinning. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">His
heavy gaze was fixed on the plumber&rsquo;s boots, scorched from the
crash. Darn. &ldquo;Tell me bout it.. I said screw that. I'll do what
I want. Clawdia and I eloped and my only regret then was that Dad
never got a chance to yell at me over making the &lsquo;wrong&rsquo;
choice. It&rsquo;s like this, Mario.&rdquo; He paused, before
pressing on. &ldquo;I was a doofus last night. Here&rsquo;s my
do-over.&rdquo; </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">The
Koopa King closed the distance, almost lounged, for a kiss before he
could talk himself out of it. The softness of his beard brushing his
snout, and the warmth from the human&rsquo;s hands flowing around his
collar to the scales beneath, the rare opportunity to comb through
the plumber&rsquo;s slick hair.. With the ambient temps in the
nineties, Bowser had a case of the chills. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">C-can
I say something?&rdquo; Mario pulled back. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">The
roles switched, Bowser nodded gently, intently studying the plumber&rsquo;s
reddened face. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Bowser.
I like you too. Alot. It&rsquo;s just, you did have a point last
night. Maybe we shouldn't rush this right now. What&rsquo;s causing
this?&rdquo; </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">The
poignant question shook Bowser out of his blank stare. He faintly
made his way to this desk again. &ldquo;That meditation thing! I&rsquo;m
the same age my dad was when was murdered, if that&rsquo;s not the
time to gather yourself.. &rdquo; </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Mario
sat on the edge of it. &ldquo;I get that, but we can&rsquo;t elope if
that&rsquo;s where you were going.&rdquo; </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">He
shrugged casually. &ldquo;I thought maybe I&rsquo;d convince ya if we
went somewhere romantic, like the Rainbow Cruise.&rdquo; </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Cute,
fine he&rsquo;d give him that, alas, he slid off the desk and drifted
away. &ldquo;Bowser.. It&rsquo;s.. still a &lsquo;not now&rsquo; for
me.&rdquo; </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Bowser
waited until he was over a certain spot and then slapped a button.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m kidnapping you unironically then!&rdquo; </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">His
new and improved layer&rsquo;s chandelier dropped right on Mario,
tangling him up before it lifted him to the ceiling again. Meanwhile
lava guzzled out of the ducts for the fountain, filling the space. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">You
cannot be serious right now!&rdquo; the plumber growled. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Without
an answer, Bowser left the throne, everything a blur. Though he
didn&rsquo;t throw such a fit back there, in his mind the walls
peeled, the floor crumbled, and the roof disintegrated. What was
coiled in him all along, it snapped. He saw himself from the outside,
zombied, unsure how he got down a floor with the crone and that old
tube radio in the hallway. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Dearie,&rdquo;
Kammy began, dismayed &ldquo;there&rsquo;s word of a train accident
not too far-&rdquo; </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">The
Koopa King swatted the antique away. </span></font></span></em>
</p>
<p><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Like
he cared. Trainwreck would better describe his heart. </span></font></span></em>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">In a cold
sweat, Bowser lifted his head, greeted with a view of his stark
throne room. He couldn&rsquo;t ignore this anymore, conceding to hold
down the buzzer. His old man might get it. He&rsquo;d gone senile in
reverse afterall, sane-ish now compared to the baby-obsessed, yoshi
asbestos inventing nut job he once was..</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There came
the distinctive shuffle of the geezer.</font></p>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
magikoopa trickled in, expectedly. &ldquo;Yes, my lord?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Just as
Bowser was gonna let it out, a steady beep he must have drowned out
before was noticeable. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you after I take this
call. Scram.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Vater,

rest stop with an outlet, my battery would have depleted,&rdquo;</font></em>

harshly.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">..Why
do you sound like that??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">..Better?
Vater, my actions caught up with- Leave me alone!..&rdquo; Ludwig
grumbled to someone, the other party's responses distorted.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
knew a tug-o-war when he heard it. &ldquo;Son?&rdquo; He dashed to
the raindroplet-filled window for a clearer reception, his ghostly,
distraught reflection staring back. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be in the
slammer! How are you gonna take over in a year?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
came back on, gasping for air, hopefully the victor of whatever that
was.&ldquo;- Is that position- not- occupied by ..government name:

<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser Koopa
Jr.?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser&rsquo;s
thoughts nearly grind to a halt. &ldquo;Junior was gonna be the face
of tyranny is all, why.. He&rsquo;s named like that. Look, it seemed
like the least selfish move without a queen anymore. You koopalings
were growing up so absolved of, you know, &lsquo;compulsory&rsquo;
service, I&rsquo;d know what all of you really wanted to do with your
lives. Ludwig, I have no doubt about what you wanna do. Get it?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Vater-
I..Yes, thank you. I am confined in a way, but I promise I will try
to- Oh again? Grrr-&rdquo; Ludwig argued again with that unknown.
&ldquo;Stop, or I will slap you with that scroll holder!!!.. Vater,
before I go, I must tell you that.. Yes, them. Is.... actually...
your.. &hellip;.. &hellip;..!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">An
outdoors patrol minion resisted the urge to clip on earphones. From
the dry bone&rsquo;s vantage point, his lord was in the window
unblinkingly. Shortly he gave in to old habits, it evident Bowser
wasn&rsquo;t really seeing anything.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Can&rsquo;t
you help us?&rdquo; one on the road begged, starbits up to their
neck. Tremors raked through the city as Star Hill spewed like a
volcano.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
am. I swear. I apologize it doesn&rsquo;t appear that way..&rdquo;<br/>
&hellip;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A bright
arrow sliced across the ancient ruins and desert plains of Southern
Mushroom Kingdom, outgunning tweesters and Mecha-Yoshi to reach the
other side. Stopping the mach speed kart was more difficult, sliding
beyond the rusty old factory she targeted, and almost off a coastal
cliff, waves crashing below. She coaxed the kit build to a stop after
a loud spinny show, scaring the King&rsquo;s nobles into the gem
encrusted caves. No longer in motion, she let herself breathe. The
King could have fled anywhere with the headstart he had, yet he chose
the old quarry she suspected. Best yet, the guards had quit it
appeared, so no threat of return firepower. Rich veins connecting to
the Rock Candy Mines, it was also the passage her ancestors used to
follow the &lsquo;call of the stars&rsquo; and settle in the Mushroom
Kingdom, and the first labor camp she closed down upon take over.
Abandoning it to locals led to the modern day dichotomy where the
South had podunk yet wealthy towns, prone to mutiny to her
government, but amiable with her personally.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bam! The
red hot king kicked open factory doors, broad chest rising and
falling, and a sword strapped to his side. Finding his daughter
pocketing a winding key, more pale than Queen Chanterelle ever got,
his rage faded.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Father,
a curse is devouring me, my friends, and my kingdom. Can you help me,
or will I deal with this on my own?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Concern
flitted across his hard face before he twisted off his signet ring,
his beard going from straight and black to scraggly gray. &ldquo;-Daughter,
you got your subjects to supply you with their allegiance, labor, and
love on your own. I&rsquo;ll cut you slack now.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She closed
it in her palm. &ldquo;Father, thank you, sincerely&hellip; Also I
believe.. It&rsquo;s pertinent you check on your toads right now.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Her loud
roaring escape in the gray primer painted kart bowled him over with
red dust. Next he knew, the toads he could be chasing down, tugged
him deeper into the fuzzy infested cave. Before he fussed at them, he
was knocked off his feet again, the factory exploding into flames.
Jr. Troopa&rsquo;s ostro riding ranchers would sniff around after the
King&rsquo;s toads wore him down. Conclusion: autobomb.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Careful
there.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The young
man in the cell opposite patted the pile of gunpowder against the
brick wall. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m good at this, trust me.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">As
much as I am running and jumping around here?&rdquo; the other
prisoner spoke up &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re at least half as much you&rsquo;ll
have half as much of a chance as that of getting whatever you're
doing to work.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Spy Guy
whipped his way, barely able to see him in the dark candle lit
dungeon. &ldquo;-I thought you quit being a plumber to be a stay at
home dad for the koopa kids, not some riddler.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Better
career change than secretary to felon.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Spy Guy
lit a match, growling, &ldquo;Just back up!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His
explosive pile popped with a lot of smoke. The agent allotted for
crumbling debris then charged for it. He smacked against the same
solid brick wall, only blackened.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
rolled his eyes behind iron bars. &ldquo;With podoboos, flame bars,
and fire bros, KT gunpowder is an eighth as strong as the Mushroom
Kingdom stuff..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">ENOUGH
with the-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Hey,
hush yo mouth!&rdquo; a guard barked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Spy Guy
simmered on his bench as Mario snorted. 'Good try sport', that was a
pretty eventful thirty second shift change to give him credit&hellip;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">See,
just like that they shut up. Totally a cool job.&rdquo; The koopatrol
swung the key around his gauntlet covered finger, training the toad
in chainmail armor by bringing her into the dungeon, usually the job
of the whomp holding the torch. &ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No?
Emery, I have a question then for you.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
flushed as they held up on the steps. &ldquo;Y-yeah?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
dumb, but.. why do we have different &lsquo;Mushroomcratic oaths?&rsquo;&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
distantly stared down the corridor. &ldquo;Both halves were part of
Princess Mush IV&rsquo;s wedding vows. It&rsquo;s a super messed up
story. They would always focus on the bratty part, blaming her for
the war. Still I respect her. She lived- and died authentically. Can
I change the subject? Can we pet the chomps?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Behind
her, Whomp #5, Lucius, desperately shook his head.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">..It&rsquo;s
past feeding time,&rdquo; the koopatrol probed. &ldquo;Plus I almost
lost an arm last week!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;d
always begged for one and never got it from mom, so I swore I&rsquo;d
adopt one myself. I know of the breeds, behaviors, how not to lose
limbs.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jeez!&rdquo;
he chuckled.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
brightened a little. &ldquo;And their calls. ~SIR SNAPULA!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The whomp
took flight, through the maze of the dungeon and outta there.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Crap!&rdquo;
They chased him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
shortly sprung up with a cup of drain cleaner. Actually orange juice,
kept in the castle fridge, the least requested snack watchmen could
give prisoners. Spy Guy&rsquo;s choice of a processed energy bar was
useless and as thick as the bricks he couldn&rsquo;t blast. Mario&rsquo;s
was his key out of there.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">If
you were sick of my math Charles, check out my chemistry.&rdquo;
Mario splashed the juice at the bottom of the bars and kicked them
out while sizzling from the acid.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He crawled
under and was out of there, sneaking to the BACK DOOR passage and
around the ninjis, mecha-koopas and non light generating lava pits
with ease. When fresh air and a gentle sprinkling of rain hit him, he
noticed just how shallow his breaths had become during those routine
maneuvers.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Greetings,
just hauling her in for repair!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He gasped
at the upside down clown car inching along, unsubtly dodging the
sweep of spot lights.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No
worries, we&rsquo;re Trojan &amp; Co. from Isla Falsa. Check us out
on Welp, old pal.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi!&rdquo;
They hugged under the cover of the contraption.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario,
I&rsquo;m sorry! I will never leave you in peril again.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
plumber gave them space, holding the dino&rsquo;s shoulders. &ldquo;I
put myself in danger. I should be apologizing. Let&rsquo;s scram.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wait,
I sent Goombario in,&rdquo; he mentioned unsteadily. &ldquo;Because
they-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bang!
Nerves shattered by the loud disturbance, they lifted the clown car.
The source was the top floor of Bowser Castle.</font></p>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><b>You
gotta be kidding me.&rdquo; </b></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bucken-Berry
wished he didn&rsquo;t do those cathartic, over the ocean plasma
blasts while tracking the Toad Town 104. Hey, most of his games
didn&rsquo;t have ontological inertia. How&rsquo;d he foresee them
hitting some random village over the horizon. Looked like Sky Land,
what came after Pipe Land that he&rsquo;d torched up too.Blistering
hot plasma was mostly around the mulchy outskirts, only destroying
one windmill and something that was gold, the sea flowing over-</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><b>F!&rdquo;</b></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
tracks. Then he heard.. People! Where to hide?</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The koopa
grabbed the journalist&rsquo;s dress shirt, popping buttons.
&ldquo;Jelectro&rsquo;s gone, so drop the front. You set up this
Phanto Mask, or this &lsquo;Camoztar&rsquo; thing to melt into a heap
of trouble for what?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">To
prove that a non-chosen one can trigger.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She bore
into him.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Remember
what I predicted when we were kids?..&rdquo; He pried her fingers
away. &ldquo;There&rsquo;d be something special about Princess Peach.
I admit I had a lot of wrong ideals. First trying to work for her,
later trying to chop her down. I didn&rsquo;t get the actual

humbled, screw you.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
backed off and retrieved her bag, camera, other articles, disgusted.
&ldquo;I gave ya a chance. There&rsquo;s no frenemy between us,
you&rsquo;re just on your own now.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
flattened out his clothes. &ldquo;This was my purpose.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">To
ruin a popular route for fruit trains???&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
monster popped up from behind the big warehouse. &ldquo;<b>It&rsquo;s
not just carrying fruit!&rdquo;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The lamp
of the TT104 was a mile down, illuminating how heat traveled down the
rails and popped rivets on the bridge, sagging over the deep canyon.
Bucken-Berry tapped the receiver stuffed into his ear.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">GET
OUT! MR. LUIGI AND THE REST OF YOU JUMP! IT'S GONNA CRASH!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He wrapped
his tendrils around the train as it bulleted by, digging his feet in.
He was dragged belly first, soil and molten gold splattering across
the field and bogies sparking. The middle of the three heads noticed
a compartment with lamps on. He kicked a free leg against it,
derailing that while the half he was attached to tethered on. He let
go, sliding as the 104 snapped the bridge and crashed against the
side of the ravine. The blast shook many out of their cottages, and
even more when the bright white plume rose against the black sky.
Something was within it, an iridescent scintillating rapscallion
slowly emerging from the heap of twisted metal, seven pointed, the
size of a mushroom bus.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">FOOLISH
ONE,&rdquo; Rapscintillation loomed over land, blanching onlookers.
After an indeterminable flash of emotion, &ldquo;YOU ARE VERY LUCKY.&rdquo;
The powerful being launched away with a sonic, window shattering
boom, just what the monster needed to snap out of it.</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It
was over, oh stars&rsquo; Bucken-Berry relayed over and over, pressed
back against one of the big green hills. That&rsquo;s when the triple
headed beast caught a scent he couldn&rsquo;t ignore, swiveling
towards the wreck again.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With no
feet to worry about getting on, Zoo was pushed past Luigi, Toadette,
and Daisy in the heap of splintered planks and cargo, out of the pits
into the wilderness. He rested back against a huge super bell tree,
uncontrollably shaking. After leaves and acorns dropped on him, it
only increased, finding himself under six red glowing dots above.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
was brainwashed to steal like I told your friends! You know what it&rsquo;s
like to not be in control of yourself?&rdquo; Zoo jumped away from
under the tree, emboldened. If he could read him so easily he was
untouchable. &ldquo;Drew will track me down any minute anyway, bro
and he don&rsquo;t want anything happening to me. Hey, I caught him
trying to stalk your Instaham instead of Jackson&rsquo;s for once.
Heads up.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bucken-Berry
wasn't flattered, continuing to tongue flick. <b>&quot;You've killed
a bunch of folks Drew doesn't know about, and you ain't sorry!&quot;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
casually weaved around Yoshi berry bushes. &quot;Eh, I regret giving
this one chill dude a- how'd Drew explain it once, oh yeah diffuse
axonal injury. Ala-Gold was a goner before he hit the dirt and bled
all over the place. The mess is always from the death ray attacking
soft tissue. Ain't science neat?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Like
I said, you aren't sorry,&quot; the monster hissed in his real voice,
following his sad attempt to slip.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo cast a
nasty look up there. &quot;You don't know me.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
didn't know your victims.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
aren't a god.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yet
I'm holding your fate. You know that feeling. It's time it caught up
with you.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">FLOOSH!
The dark boo&rsquo;s flesh liquefied indistinguishably into the mossy
floor following the acre desecrating plasma blast.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">When Luigi
and co hobbled over, there was no fugitive left to apprehend.
Nothing, and the scent of burning and death striking his nostrils, he
knew why. The green plumber decided that, with red and blue lights on
the horizon they&rsquo;d better take a detour. In the ash field, he
contacted the princess about how rapidly this was spiraling. Her
reaction-</font></p>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
aren&rsquo;t angry!!!!!&rdquo; a koopa jogger megaphoned Toad, the
dummy on the outside of the barrier into Royal Raceway instead of
behind it. &ldquo;We are simply concerned about the state of our
kingdom!!!!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad&rsquo;s
ears had the muted ring of a sepia toned war flashback. Fitting, when
he was the last toad standing in a way. Many were leaving town,
displeased over what appeared to be a stalemate between Peach and her
father, or spooked by other happenings, and whoever weren&rsquo;t
were in the mob right here. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not gonna try to
convince any of you that your feelings aren&rsquo;t valid. I&rsquo;m
just gonna say this. If I get elected in Neo Bowser City, you&rsquo;ll
start to have a choice. &quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Then he
could hear a pin drop. There it went, spelt differently rather, from
the scuffed up Lakitu Bro pushing his way to the front. &ldquo;Mr.
Toad Kinopio Toad, for the record, what&rsquo;s special about that
place?&ldquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mayor
Koton is a jerk, greasing the roads, the enslavement obviously, and
holding mail hostage, but he fought to make it a democracy so props
to letting himself be challenged. Me being there, so blasphemously or
whatever, and on a commoner level is important for other toads and
non-toads alike to see. If I&rsquo;m terrible, for once the people
can haul my butt out.&quot;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Interesting,&rdquo;
murmured a bob-omb buddy. Others side eyed, but listened.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Good
speech, if uncouth..&rdquo; Chef Tim friendly fired out of nowhere.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
shrugged. If feeling better was going to be the trend the more he
went mask off, maybe he could handle this. &ldquo;Ask me anything.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadia
overtook the Lakitu Bro trying to take notes in his palm. &ldquo;Why
did you reject the Luigi fan club offer five times?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad sat
up on the square barrier for that one. &ldquo;It&rsquo;d be creepy
when I was already his best friend and I didn&rsquo;t know how else I
felt about him.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Her
friends raised cain. Others dispersed with the latest gossip, their
thirst for vengeance quenched, Toad guessed. Thomas slyly poked his
head out of a traffic barrel he'd hid in.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sir,
how did you know?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
relished every moment with him.. On slow days, when life was hectic.
Good times, even bad.. And I understand that&rsquo;s squarely friend
zone, don&rsquo;t mash those together, for most, but for me I
couldn&rsquo;t ignore the feeling of, &lsquo;oh I&rsquo;m in love.&rsquo;
Happy?-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A blue
birdo waved for attention. &ldquo;Favorite color?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
loosened his collar. &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not red. Let&rsquo;s get
that out of the way.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">One in the
crowd dipped out after the reveal, his black kimono hiding colorful
Yakuza tattoos, and shades his distinctive face. With only so many
hours of daylight left, he had six or seven more old sponsors to
shake down over seized assets. After actually losing a shouting match
with a lowly item shop employee Saleisha, the blogger realized that
the in person forum and the integrity shown by the Earl he was named
after was giving him much to think about on the way back to Japan,
Water Land.</font></p>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Inspector
Douglas&rsquo; Piranha Pipes kart took him away from the tropical,
island hopping route into northern wintry conditions. A former
vehicle of the Isle Delfino police, its goop proof nature made
getting around easy. He struggled rather to find the sergeant and
their inmates. Soon flurries were accumulating on his cap. He zipped
up his coat as the regional emergency calls came in on the radio,
thick accented citizens somewhere in the ice block forts reporting on
a statue busting maniac.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
officer radioed back: &lsquo;Description?&rsquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What they
described the officer found, skidding around a frozen lake where
mountains were leveled. Shuddering, the human crouched, tapping one
key at a time on his computer. &lsquo;SUSPECT. ARMED. DANGEROUS,&rsquo;
it blared. He pinched his hat brim, the investigator completely green
at the violent cases. Whatever the boo diddly was doing, it appeared
like a banzai bill had dropped.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Fighting
his fears, He shakily put the spotlight on them. &ldquo;Booigi.&rdquo;
He let the intercom stop screeching. &ldquo;You prefer that, don&rsquo;t
cha? Come talk with us at the station.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Booigi ii
slowly spun. &ldquo;I. Prefer. Concentration&hellip;But I will accept
your ride home. I have &lsquo;business&rsquo; there.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">..
Deal?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">From the
cruiser rolling up, Snifit Patrol saw the suspect secured in the rear
of the Pipe kart. Best of all, his fellow, and presently only other
officer had his head on his body still. &ldquo;Great job, Doug. No
problems?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Their
vehicles parallel. Douglas leaned over. &ldquo;Don't jinx it.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The snufit
got the hint pretending to jot notes when Booigi was facing them.
&ldquo;Well well. To the precinct for Mx. Diddley. I&rsquo;ll pop in
after I get a report from a victim at the hospital.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">From
that train wreck?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The snufit
nodded, revving up his more powerful engine. &ldquo;Suspended
inaugural investigation. I couldn&rsquo;t shake the eeriest sensation
of being watched.&rdquo; He slipped on his headset. &ldquo;And after
visiting a hellish planet of literal death yesterday, not entirely
convinced I didn&rsquo;t dream it, I&rsquo;ll take no chances.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sweeping
the Sky Land villagers doing their meager rescue work, the ancient
star pensively loomed over the lonesome toad, traveling through the
adversity of mud caked wheels. Millennium Star wasn&rsquo;t ignorant
of Mitch&rsquo;s disdain for Zoo. When &lsquo;rebuilding&rsquo; the
dark boo on a molecular level, he poured over the vivid snapshot of
the green toad mangled up in a vehicle. He did not count on the
reporter going so far to smudge Zoo out of this world that he&rsquo;d
stage a rail accident, the commotion and, oddly specific, the gamma
rays emanating from another party involved keeping him from swooping
in to preserve his death ray spouting pet.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
were clever, just not enough. Time&rsquo;s up.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mitch
stopped at the crest of a hill, the moon behind him and the mist
settling below, rotating to face the purple star. He inhaled to
speak, then changed his mind, lips curling into a smile. &ldquo;(Look
at it from another angle.)&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The most
shameful moment he could remember in eons, Millennium stared dumbly
at that.. toad shaped abomination. He lashed out, the zap making the
journalist slump lifelessly. He telekinetically looted his body for
divine articles, scrolls, anything. </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">How
did he, a mortal, psychically intercept him?</font></em> <font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There
was nothing, only a crowbar to take. The journalist&rsquo;s pillaged
body smacking the grasslands, a sharp pain startled the star into
launching up into the atmosphere, where he was caught by a very
strong grip.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Done
bein&rsquo; antisocial? ..Gawd, Milly, you look awful!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Merely..
Confused there,&rdquo; he panted, avoiding eye contact.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The star
warrior stopped coddling him, one eyebrow rising. &quot;We better
conversate somewhere else. I got this situation on lock.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That&rsquo;s
not a..&rsquo; Millennium Star plastered on a smile. &ldquo;Of
course, &#9825;&#9834;!?&rdquo;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There was
a chance this wasn&rsquo;t what he thought. Bowser cleared the lump
in his throat. &ldquo;X chump, I looked into all you do for the
&lsquo;other&rsquo; side. Why&rsquo;d you build me a replica castle?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Once
I was up to speed, it wasn&rsquo;t against any code of mine&hellip;&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah
right!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Would
it be inappropriate to discuss what your mercenary did to my Blue
Falcon?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
advanced on him, stopping only a yard away, smoke pouring from
nostrils.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Or
I'll..just.. Have a talk with my insurance!!&rdquo; Mr. X added, big
claws shielding himself from the scepter brought out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">If there
wasn't a safety on the new models of these things, Bowser feared he
might have vaporized him there. Minions, rookies as intentionally
chosen, dumped the captive in his throne room. Without that clothing
there was no obfuscating that Mr. X was a wimpish powder blue scaled
dragon koopa with beady grayish eyes, stubby horns, curly red hair,
and a pencil mustache. Advanced in years or not, Clarentine Ao Koopa.
-Senior, technically. The ring wasn&rsquo;t fooling him though, his
brother had never wed or sired any kids. There was a look to that,
unignorable, like how this was the guy that ensured the deathbed
utterances of their copper scaled father were branded into his brain
forever. &lsquo;It was such a shame that his kingdom was going to the
</font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">younger</font></em>
<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">son.&rsquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So
it was a favor? Do me another then - brother!&rdquo; Bowser aimed
against Mr. X&rsquo;s flat chest. &quot;Why did you run?!?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">X
sputtered, &ldquo;The Troop was going to use me as a weapon. I
expressed that readily and no one listened, so I had to sever my
connections forcibly Bowser, you realize that!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He pressed
harder. &ldquo;What kept you away when I&rsquo;d sacked all the
elders? When the war was over? And after that too?? What?!?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
was preparing to return by the time Roy was born, until I was injured
at sea. With that bout of amnesia-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
zapped X across the room. &quot;Clarentine, like I&rsquo;m gonna buy
that!!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mewling in
pain, Mr. X scooted until his shell was stopped by the sealed door.
&ldquo;Bowser.. Believe me. You remember why I proposed we attach
wings to our ships? A mine hit a ship I was in, and down it went
easily. I washed up on Mushroom Territory penniless. I was spared
only because no one, including myself, knew who I was.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
wished he didn&rsquo;t believe him, scalding tears rolling. One
emotion presided however, so quickly it surprised him, expressed by
the heavy treasure chest he lobbed at his brother. Mr. X ducked as it
struck and dented his iron door. The Koopa Bros grappled, bulky
shells on both punching walls, feet stamping glass shards.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Okay
fine whatever you lost your memory, but why didn&rsquo;t you do
something- at least write me when you got it back?!?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;d
have- It&rsquo;s generous to call them &lsquo;partners&rsquo;, but..
Ah!&rdquo; X was dragged across the desk, flipping with it. &ldquo;Stars
that hurts&hellip;. they&rsquo;d get so antsy if I dare mention
Darklandian matters..&rdquo; He stood up, gasping for air.. &ldquo;Bowser..
If you ever lived in their world, the smallest gesture could ruin
you. I was always the &lsquo;exception&rsquo;.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
lowered the bookcase he was about to bash over his head. &ldquo;&hellip;Sorry
man.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hmph.
Now you are..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mr. X
unexpectedly spat blue fire in his face. The Koopa King stumbled back
while receiving several hard body blows, his room torched up. Bowser
taunted, luring his brother to advance across the seared black
Darkland crest rug, then- wham! Down crashed the chandelier. While
the glass was still flying, Bowser hobbled closer. He tasted blood,
all banged up, but X was more so, dazed under all that gold plated
metal..</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You..win,&rdquo;
X coughed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
offered a hand. &ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t too shabby at the end
though.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mr. X
latched on without hesitation. &ldquo;Eh I.. I wasn&rsquo;t thinking
with that burst of anger.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
one thing we got in common... Look, like you know the Mushroom folks
well, I know my guys. We&rsquo;d probably have your head if you&rsquo;d
tried to come back.&rdquo; There was a huge bang outside the room.
Bowser sighed, &ldquo;Scram and lemme deal with this.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">While X
was taking the developer exit he&rsquo;d put there- wait what?
..Bowser peeped out into the hall.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-King
Dad I know I&rsquo;m grounded but heads up!&rdquo; Lemmy hopped
around. &ldquo;Kamek heard a boss fight and authorized this!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The doors
were blown off by the battering ram, the crowd carrying it careening
through the inferno. Before Bowser could scream that he had
sprinklers for this, dazzling lights emerged from the charred chest
pile, stronger than Iggy&rsquo;s radioactive microwave meltdowns.
This time, instead of forcing them to quarantine an entire floor, a
jewel shattered and blew the roof off.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
anxious group rocketed across the desertic Bowser Valley. In control
of the beast of a vehicle after Peach passed out and they didn&rsquo;t
want to take chances, Luigi wasn&rsquo;t all there either in
actuality. His attention darted between the narrow barrierless lanes
and a crooked mirror, hoping he&rsquo;d see six glowing dots
somewhere following.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
have to shape up,&rdquo; he thought spontaneously. &ldquo;We want
Mario back without a lengthy fight.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Aww
man!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
final, Daisy.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
Sarasalandian rolled her eyes. &ldquo;...Nice ring by the way,
Peachy.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
princesses vis-&agrave;-vis, Daisy was allowed to hold Peach&rsquo;s
right hand in place, the first time they steadied, examining the
emerald and gold ring, large but gorgeous on her. Thankfully Toadette
broke the silence with a more astute observation.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Does
it have special properties?</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
slipped it off momentarily. &ldquo;-Considering I only fainted when
that dark star was released, empirically yes. If I hadn&rsquo;t pried
it from my father..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hardcore!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
smiled back to the only other princess she knew that was also a
friend. &ldquo;Yes, dear. Maybe it&rsquo;s over. Shall we.. see each
other more?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yeah!&quot;
Daisy leaned in, her response catching up to her. &quot;Wait. Like-&quot;
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-The
terrain went downhill, bumps and drop-offs jumbling them up. Not over
yet! Through the purple fog, Luigi got a glimpse of misspelled and
drooping signs, Koopa Troop activity, before the brakes locked up.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peeeach!&rdquo;
He swerved around lava puddles and solid volcanic boulders, the kart
tilting side to side.. &ldquo;E-brake???&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So
strapped down, Peach couldn&rsquo;t reach the levers before rolling
gates came up, their high speed forcing the monty moles at it to
burrow as they shot through the chains and barbed metal.</font></p>

and visibly skeptical, Dorguy with alacrity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The rookie
went in on his own, pointing and firing a finger gun at his head.
Away from the Twygz, weaving through the deepest darkest cavern in
the universe, there was no getting out of this. He&rsquo;d sorta
developed a phobia for water anyway, and to be fair, he looked like
the sort of guy he always wanted to be, snazzy in a pin striped suit
and a pair of prescription glasses that wouldn&rsquo;t fall off all
the time. The d-man entered a torch lit, gothic all black alcazar
with wild chomps in the backyard, home of some office space where
he'd have to behave at least sixty percent less like a psychopath
than he was used to. He got his cubicle, his stack of soul records to
organize, was almost shown the bathroom-</font></p>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Stomping
down the long flight again, the one waiting for him at the bottom

over realm.. And especially not from your own brother!</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
embedded an interdimensional tracker on you.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Face
squashed against rock, Zoo managed, &ldquo;Yeah but how&rsquo;d you
get in, Drew?!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It
is easy to transcend when you have an extra life generator,&rdquo;
Prof. X-Naut informed, standing next to the swirling vortex. The sort
of jugs ferry drivers had were stacked there too, filled with purple
Twygz water.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo pushed
Dr. Toad back into that, the clash allowing him to skip out of there
with their own portal. Yeah, why lose out on that extra forty?</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoom! The
scholar&rsquo;s priceless scrolls slipped away into space. &ldquo;Sloweth
down!&rdquo; she scolded.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">If
accurate communication was the cornerstone of advanced civilization,
inaccurate was the wrecking ball. Ludwig would rather be hit by such,
no matter how much carnage it&rsquo;d inflict on his delicate winged
body, than deal with these sages. From a disappointingly pedestrian
Overthere pantheon, if they weren&rsquo;t the initial spotters of
Rosalina&rsquo;s pilotless Observatory drifting just outside a
dimensional door, they'd have been kicked into a black hole by now.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
display flickered severe warnings upon boarding, and their splitting
up to the engine room, garden, etc, sapped what power lingered. With
Toadsworth&rsquo;s assistance, the mechanical parts so antediluvian
he was vaguely familiar, it was up again. With rousing celebration
the center beacon was a dim orange, the auto throttle gently pushing
them towards Star Temple.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Countless
galaxies strolled past without an iota of the diverse star beings
Ludwig found on his initial journey. He kept searching from high up,
desperate to prove his fears wrong until noxious space gas knocked
him out, no one catching him. Fine, he was being a Philistine
threatening to burn those scrolls.. Anyway, the Temple&rsquo;s
protective bubble beyond the bars was hazy, the fields were scorched
away, and the sanctuary rusted copper orange.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Twink
wearily watched the nimbis skirt about, lose interest and depart. &ldquo;I
held down the fort. I guess. But there's another problem.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadsworth
stopped for him. &ldquo;Hm?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
was horrified watching Millennium Star&rsquo;s fight on that ship.
Now I can only think there was something funny about it.&quot;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Is
rolling up &lsquo;gangsta style&rsquo; another way to say &lsquo;late&rsquo;?&rdquo;
the ancient star quipped after they&rsquo;d reached the goddess in
teal at an intermediate point.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Not even
brandishing the finest armor protected the star warrior &#9825;&#9834;!?
, or &lsquo;Geno&rsquo; from that slap. &ldquo;Sure you beat us, but
you ain&rsquo;t done a thang. Are you who you say you are?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Millennium
Star revealed his Band of Casualty, a colossal infinity shaped
specter representing cycles of time, spanning to each edge of the
universe. Rosalina&rsquo;s colors drained, her elliptical past woven
in that somewhere, but Geno was satisfied, forcibly pressing the
ancient one onwards.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Come
on then, fool. You won&rsquo;t believe what&rsquo;s up.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Rosalina
swore she caught the Millennium Star muttering he would.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A sentient
parasitic planetoid, Doomstar Galaxy, swiped by the Moon without
meddling with that. It was already full of organic and inorganic
material from Earth, sorted aside so that its physiognomy was
revealed. Flames from the core flit between closed eyelids, and sharp
teeth stuck out of a mouth, black acidic material oozing between. The
monochrome star, Dark Ztar relaxed in a La-Z-Boy stationed at a peak,
ordering around smaller, equally repugnant bearings: Munchztar a
corpulent, murky brown shoveler, Skeptiztar, glossy onyx and
meticulously crafting, and Camoztar, gold plated and in everyone&rsquo;s
way from being introduced moments before. They scattered as a lilac
diamond shaped proponent of prudence, Parallelogon stormed onto the
scene.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Explain
yourself, Villain!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Whom they
were actually speaking to, Rapscintillation came around from the dark
side of Doomstar. &ldquo;I was trying to avoid this, Shapes!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Parallelogon
used the &lsquo;Peer of Truth&rsquo; on the adversary. Realizing it
was, they bashfully cut it out. &ldquo;Well.. listen up! You will do
well to help me!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Rapscintillation
spat out the antenna pole they were using as a toothpick. &ldquo;I
COULD use a warm-up before it&rsquo;s your turn..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Jaydes,
how'd this happen?&ldquo; Geno growled, coming up. &ldquo;They're
more dangerous in cahoots than duking it out!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dark Ztar
left his steamy cup of tea on a nice glass stand and removed the
blanket from his lap- revealing a gatling gun. The primordial rivals
split apart before Geno could snatch either, leaving him in the
crosshairs. He held out a shield, the jets of dark matter pushing him
miles back and reflecting off, disintegrating anything in its path.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After that
influx, the star warrior bit his lip. This was not &lsquo;on lock&rsquo;
at all.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">In the
surge of flying shrapnel, Bowser tucked into his shell. His spikes
embedded into wet Darklandian soil, shortly buried by bricks. It was
over like that, not the worst castle collapse he&rsquo;d been in,
because he could tell the entire thing hadn&rsquo;t fallen. If it
had, the faint utterances of &lsquo;what happened&rsquo; would be far
more panicky than perplexed.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ugh..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
saw the whole thing, doofus.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-You??
Wait a sec.&rdquo; Bowser strenuously pushed against tons of
material.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Someone
pulled a few planks and boards away, partially inching into the
pocket he was in. &ldquo;Or just follow me&hellip;&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The King
burrowed out into the resulting ruckus from soggy, pajama wearing
troops. Well there it was, mostly, SNES Bowser Castle in a torrential
rainstorm, minus the roof and the top floors. Mario prepared for a
filibuster, a fit, or a fight, not for Bowser to drape a blackened
emblem flag over him and shoo him away.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
no you don't,&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;Bowser, I&rsquo;m sorta..
Effed up. Why&rsquo;d you rubber stamp this kidnap?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
just said it. I&rsquo;m bad with rejection, and I did a stupid.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
pulled the flag over his shoulders, tiredly walking beyond unaware
minions.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Now
you get it,&rdquo; Bowser briskly followed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what I
deserve when you flipped your world upside down for me, yet I haven&rsquo;t
even told anyone I love you-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
froze. &quot;Despite this.. I love you too.&rdquo; They embraced
briefly, enjoying each other&rsquo;s touch.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Alright.
Now go!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He slung
Mario towards the gates where he was surprised to see Yoshi and
Goombario already over there, backing up fearfully. A flat tire and
five blockades on the way to Castle Koopa had slowed the kart of
Luigi and co down, nonetheless they couldn&rsquo;t stop, gently
tapping with the bumper against the final, most interior iron gate.
Its slow swing open screeched like a banshee.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
Mario!!! And Luigi!!! And everyone else get them!!&rdquo; Koopa Troop
rallied, gathering clubs and sticks.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
slammed the lever into reverse, anything he&rsquo;d rehearsed
promptly tossed. &ldquo;Hop on the hood!!!&rdquo;<br/>
Mario and the
others flopped onto the slanted surface as they lurched backward.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Stop!!!&rdquo;
Bumped around by his minions, Bowser noticed where Mario and co were
going. &ldquo;-And watch out!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach,
Daisy, and Toadette were coated in ash. &ldquo;The volcano!&rdquo;
they cried.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
twisted from the lakitus about to spiny storm, lava so bright it
temporarily blinded him. He spun the wheel so that the enemies bashed
against the rear of the kart, pushing them. Yoshi, Poochy, and
Goombario climbed in, but another bursting tire shook Mario off.
Yoshi and Daisy held him as he dangled over the spoiler. Luigi
couldn&rsquo;t slow, he had to do the opposite.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Where's
the boost, princess?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;A-are
we gonna jump this?&quot; Daisy clicked her seat belt, one handed.
&quot;Yeah, go for it!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Wait,
what?&quot; Mario gasped.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hang
on tightly,&rdquo; Peach gave the turbo a firm click.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
rockets blasted fire, shooting the kart up the volcano and into the
air. They soared over the big Boo Moon, Mt. Koopatoa and the Badlands
shrinking below them. Everyone screamed, Toadette&rsquo;s in
particular beckoning a giant abductor to swoop by. Everyone hung from
a seat belt, the wheel, anything, precariously in the air.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><b>My
bad, guys.&rdquo;</b></font> 
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
thanked everyone in between his breaths. As long as Bucken-Berry
didn&rsquo;t fly them over any areas he hadn&rsquo;t annihilated, he
assumed might be in the clear&hellip;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Innocents
might be hurt, planets surrounding them swiss cheesed, yet
Parallelogon was left behind by Rapscintillation, wrapping around
Doomstar to zap her with bolts. While the atmosphere thickened from
loosened dirt and spray of acid, she kept moving. They switched to
their heavy artillery, an energy beam to slice at her, uprooting the
mounds, ships, bodies, all, sending them back into Earth&rsquo;s
orbit. Parallelogon was about to stop their chaotic frenzy when
Munchztar snuck up and spat stinging goop in their face.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hrrg!&rdquo;
Parallelogon brought out a longsword of light, lacerating Munchztar
in the middle. The Prudent one flung that dark star into the sun,
creating a heat surge that blew them onto Cheese Land, the only
planet around looking identical as it started. With cheddar dust in
the air, they saw a pure black outline in the midst. They tossed the
blade at Skeptiztar, the weapon caught with their palms.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~Thy
reign is abolished.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Their
aurora beam stabbed Parallelogon, channeling every event they&rsquo;d
missed since encapsulation. Death, torment and violence drilled their
brain out, limply rolling off the edible planet into a thick purple
and blue nebula.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Disappear.&rdquo;
The Great Eldstar&rsquo;s voice echoed. &ldquo;Nothing can redeem
you!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Parallelogon
fit themselves together, waddling towards His glow. &ldquo;Great
Master, reconsider...&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They would
never reach Camoztar&rsquo;s illusion, going in circles.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Meanwhile,
Doomstar cracked into four pieces to nimbly evade Rapscintillation,
easy when they stopped in the middle of battle, ears perked by the
whimpers of their eternal rival in that gas cloud over there. Slam!
The Doomstar parts converged with Rapscintillation in the center,
sealing them.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Take
that, bugger.&rdquo; Dark Ztar laid off the trigger, gloating cut
short when his arm was twisted painfully and the tip of a star rod
jabbed under his neck.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You&rsquo;re
under arrest! Where&rsquo;s the rest of.. Da faq??!-&rdquo; Geno dove
with him as Parallelogon shot out of the nebula with a short reserve
dagger.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No
one can.. Defeat them.. But.. me!&rdquo; The lilac star plunged it
into the seams of Doomstar, wedging it apart.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Rosalina
quickly bubbled Munchztar before they flanked anyone, and Camoztar in
their concealment. That left-</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~Implore,
please, of the fate of the Rosettas..&rdquo; the onyx star toyed. &ldquo;I
</font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">do</font></em>
<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">know.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
goddess held firm against the phantasm, snapping up Skeptiztar too.
&ldquo;I am content, no thank you.&rdquo; She almost felt hopeful
about this, until noticing that Doomstar was too substantial to force
field. &ldquo;&#9825;&#9834;!? , someone else must handle that one.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The star
warrior continued to choke out Dark Ztar, turning to the Ancient One.
&ldquo;Milly, it&rsquo;s up to you!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It
is.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Millennium
Star zoomed almost unnecessarily fast over there, to the star
warrior, a dominance display. Whatever bro. He wasn&rsquo;t so
fragile to care right then. What Rosalina saw however&hellip;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser&rsquo;s
chest untightened. All the Koopa Troop could do was trickle off Mt.
Koopatoa and come on home.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dis
is so flipping weird.&rdquo; Roy suppressed his shivers in the rain,
too proud to ask Morton who&rsquo;d been wise enough to evacuate the
castle with a warm blanket, for a piece.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well,
what did we sneak into town for?&rdquo; Lemmy let them catch on.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ohmygosh!&rdquo;
Wendy cupped her mouth. &ldquo;That jewel?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dang!&rdquo;
Larry slipped between the older siblings. &ldquo;Tell me somebody
recorded it popping off!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy slyly
brought out a metal Recorder that, besides being a ticket to a Warp
Zone, actually recorded per his modifications. &ldquo;-Yup, including
the ~lOvE profession at the finale!~&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
what?!&rdquo; his siblings crowed</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
rushed over. &ldquo;Okay, gather around and listen. It&rsquo;s about
time... We&rsquo;ve been fighting a phantom since Peach took over. Of
all of the enemies we actually have these days, the least of them is
Mario. That&rsquo;s how..&quot; He swallowed hard. &quot;I started to..to like the guy.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boss,
I respect ya but even I got limits.&rdquo; Sentry 11 led the way
across the drawbridge, sweeping many with him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
shoved ahead of the mob, standing between them and the open doors.
&ldquo;Disagree all you want, but it&rsquo;s trashed in there. Let&rsquo;s
take over a motel or somethin.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No
my Lord,&rdquo; Kamek hissed. &ldquo;The deplorable weather matches
our spirits when you're chummy with plumbers.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
rolled up. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take over super soon and we don&rsquo;t
like plumbers! Not even close! We haven't been in love for like five in a half years either!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His
siblings backed him up.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-But
to be honest there is other good guy stuff we like, so King Dad isn&rsquo;t
that weird.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Roy
thunked him. &quot;Way ta go.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
shrunk under the sudden negative attention and booing. As with a
Wheel of Death rehearsal though, he was in motion and had to commit,
besides it feeling like the right thing to do. &ldquo;Just being
honest! My troupe at Emerald Circus are mostly Mushroom people and
we&rsquo;re all cool. Roy, isn't your Koopa Ball coach a friendly
species?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
sunglasses wearer stepped off. &ldquo;Yeah but..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-And
Morton, who do you mail your fanzines to?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Anyone

volunteered impulsively.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Noooo!&rdquo;
Kamek exclaimed, Kammy weeping into his bosom.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy
and Wendy, aren&rsquo;t the people on that Princess Parlor Discord
thing a bunch of toads?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Correct,
Lemmy-sama, HOWEVER!&rdquo; The genius held a finger up, a little too
long. &rdquo;..Eh, well, we verified them irl. Everyone sent a photo
with a paper and a username.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">..Okay
that&rsquo;s a bit much, but-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Who
cares?&rdquo; Wendy folded her arms, walking off. &ldquo;So what some
are okay? So what if I own a life size poster of my celebrity crush,
Emerson Lake Toad, or Toad #23 from the Toadtanic rip-offs?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">How
old is he?&rdquo; Bowser cut in.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...19.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wait
a year.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">But
daddy!&rdquo; she bawled. &ldquo;..*sigh* Anyway, that&rsquo;s an
exception! If you agree, join the Wendy Menace. That&rsquo;s right,
I&rsquo;ve reclaimed that moniker.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
surprisingly got a bunch of followers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Pink on
pink warfare, Roy shoved her aside. &quot;Lemme clear dis up. My
coach n teammates are acquaintances ONLY. Pure business&rsquo;s how
it&rsquo;s gotta be with Mushroom brats.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
garnered a group of burlier or more elite troop, Morton, Sentry 11,
and whatever Hippity Hop counted as.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Guys!&quot;
Lemmy reasoned. &quot;Anybody&rsquo;s okay as long as they're good
people- which ANYONE can be.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With some
hesitance, another portion of the troop split to his side.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;None
of it is okay for any reason!!!&quot; Kammy squalled.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Enough
of this!&rdquo; Bowser&rsquo;s stomps shocked them into silence,
allowing Junior to inch up beyond the dense group.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Can
I get a line?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kamek
scooped him up, holding the tyke high over his head. &ldquo;Yes my
young whippersnapper, our most loyal who definitely has no enemy
friends, share your insight!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The baggy
eyed six year old yawned. &quot;Scoutmaster told me that Mushroom
people act like what we&rsquo;re acting like.. So.. Can I go to bed?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The child
hopped to the ground on his own in the silence, zombie walking into
the puddles filling the roofless castle.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;He's
so right.&quot; In the undetermined bunch, the young trooper was
staring at her boots when Larry gently bumped her elbow.</font></p>

Star hovered over the destroyer, jabbing a crowbar into a cross
section to aid Parallelogon&rsquo;s crazed tactics. Rapscintillation
burst Doomstar open from the inside, the evil planet&rsquo;s tortured
cries ear splitting, and didn&rsquo;t skip a beat, swirling up the
biggest dark matter ball they could muster to aim at Dark Ztar,
whether or not the star warrior was apprehending him.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
freaking did it!&rdquo; Suspect limp in his arms, it didn&rsquo;t
matter. Geno couldn&rsquo;t let go. &ldquo;Somebody do something!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Breaking
out of the daze, Parallelogon tackled the rival, the throw going wide
and spatting on the Band of Casualty. Taut silver film melted away,
frayed sections littering space, making it difficult to see.
Parallelogon and Rapscintillation bickered their way off the scene,
possibly by their voices fading. What Geno heard clearly was
Rosalina&rsquo;s gasp of pain. He whipped around. She was ghostly,
passing out, all of her force fields breaking. Heart in his throat,
he dropped Dark Ztar to lunge and catch her.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What&rsquo;s
it doing to her, Milly?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
will chase the rascals.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Geno
yanked Millennium Star right back. &ldquo;Slick, you set up this punk
reunion. Besides babysitting the Ouroboros, and you make Chaos. By
Higher Authorities power I detain you here.&rdquo; Rosalina over his
shoulder, he pressed his free palm into his forehead, spiritually
bonding the troublemaker to the zone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The way
Millennium Star glared, Geno would have chuckled in any other
circumstance. What, didn&rsquo;t think his BS would be called out by
a relatively young cadet, 250 as of last August?</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
will despise that.&rdquo; The ancient one made the bands drop towards
Earth like missiles, particularly towards the location said to be
Eldstar&rsquo;s favorite.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Milly sure
was a broken clock. The only reason the star warrior didn&rsquo;t
snap his neck is because he couldn&rsquo;t do it with one hand.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Ridiculous!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Fresh
Overthere resident Ludwig was &lsquo;righteous&rsquo;, their
terminology not his, enough to breach the pearly gates, yet there was
no forcing open the actual entrance into Star Temple. His forehead
rested against it as Toadsworth spammed the high tech doorbell with a
camera and the star kid cautiously watched.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hmph..
Perhaps the ship has something to help.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
brought his head up, eyes widening. &ldquo;It would be unwise to
check now, Samuel!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A white
light speed traveling triangle, a paper plane crashed into the center
of the Observatory, tearing the fabric of the roof with the tail,
wings scraping flat the terrace and the library, and the nose with
the extinguished beacon embedded in it plowing into the temple.
Furniture Twink recognized, some good stuff too, pieces from the
entertainment suite, flew out the back of the building, and the
plane&rsquo;s momentum dying, the tail end dropped. Everyone
dispersed in some random direction, sapphire cracking from impact.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sorry...&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Embarrassed,
Banktoad and other toads slid off the wing, followed by frantic Giant
Spear Guys. They detected the evil in the realm, at the Chief&rsquo;s
call tearing off part of the plane to fold into a smaller one. They
flew away, ditching the final evacuees, tiny dolphin and a limping
grimacing whomp.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Who&rsquo;s
in charge?&rdquo; the sergeant demanded. &ldquo;A prohibited distress
frequency lured us here, and now we might never leave!!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
Gods..-it&rsquo;s-&rdquo; Twink stuttered.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Waist high
in crushed granite, Ludwig answered brusquely. &ldquo;I am the
commander of these operations. Thanks to your serendipitous paper
missile, we have admission.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Not
for you, Ludwig.&rdquo; The sergeant chirked up, throwing a zapper in
the nimbi&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Freeze! Wings up.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He froze
on the temple&rsquo;s stairs, it so tense they could hear the roar of
a black hole that had to be miles away. &ldquo;-How do you recognize
me!?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
sound </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Deutsch</font></em>
<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">like the Toad
Brigade, and you&rsquo;re a nimbi that just ascended. Your halo&rsquo;s
crooked. It&rsquo;s incumbent I- &hellip;Hey, I said don&rsquo;t
move!!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Leck
mich am Arsch!&rdquo; Ludwig nudged the halo while scooping up a
leftover spearhead.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bang!
Followed by a ping of off a convex surface behind him, chipping
tarnished bronze. The red blotch growing on his white robe, speckling
opulent marble beneath him, Ludwig forced himself up the remaining
steps and shattered the security box with the last of his strength.
It sparked and buzzed spectacularly, the last thing he saw before the
spearhead slipped from his grasp and he hit the floor. He accepted
instantaneously, without regrets, that despite his effort to get to
this moment, it could be over here. Sacrificing on this level was the
closest he&rsquo;d ever gotten to being a king.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">May
I assist?&rdquo; The Captain crunched a bone, or something that made
the nimbi writhe.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Banktoad
pulled his uncle away by the back of his inmate uniform.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thank
you, he&rsquo;s dying!&rdquo; Nass cried, cradling Ludwig&rsquo;s
head.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So
not cool,&rdquo; the dolphin with them grumbled.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sergeant
Howie blinked. &ldquo;You talk??&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And
I was the only Alderson that knew planets were spherical too, but
nooo, I had to be abducted with y&rsquo;all.&rdquo; Donald thought
over all of the stupidity he wouldn&rsquo;t have to endure anymore.
&ldquo;Actually. ~Thanks guys!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sobered,
the officer reached..for the radio. &ldquo;Requesting EMS.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
will get it ourselves.&rdquo; Toadsworth clamped over the officer&rsquo;s
stony hands, an old war grapple movement he didn&rsquo;t know he
remembered. &ldquo;Tut-tut. You started the emergency after all,
sir..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Those two
floating away into deep space, Twink, wanting the ground to swallow
him with all of the stress going on realized something. Taking that
jagged arrowhead when the toads weren&rsquo;t watching, he had to
enter Star Temple. There was no time for backup.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Awesome
idea, Weegee.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The green
plumber conjured a smile for Daisy, at least until he was dunked by a
surge of water. Bucken-Berry&rsquo;s monster form crossed the ocean,
everyone else on his back. Though wild and uncertain, waves choppy
and moonlight diminishing, they had each other, and this method beat
hanging onto an undrivable kart or plummeting from the sky.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
braved the spray and mist for a while. &ldquo;Blue, what&rsquo;s your
top speed?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><b>I&rsquo;m
a lil afraid to find out.&rdquo; </b></font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Phew..&rdquo;
Yoshi held onto a fiercely yapping Poochy. Better the dog take a dip
in water than lava as his usual habit, regardless he wasn&rsquo;t
allowing it.<br/>
&ldquo;Can I test something?&rdquo; Goombario
asked. &ldquo;Ah hem. Yvan &lsquo;Bucken-Berry&rsquo; Kingpin Toad:

man!&rdquo; </b></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The paper
goomba blushed. &ldquo;It was considered cheating in college and
became more of a nervous tick for me than anything.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Over
what?&rdquo; Peach hesitated to venture.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario got
splashed hard from some object smacking the water, spitting out a
cheep cheep. Bucken-Berry snaked around more of the flaming debris,
smaller ones inescapably battering them like a heavy hailstorm.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Take
that!&rdquo; Luigi pointed one of his heads over. &ldquo;No you&rsquo;re
not imagining it!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The dragon
landed belly first on the apparitional highway, the rainbow road
arching over lofty green hills. Luigi forgot to warn about the
booster effect. The group were propelled through intense loops and
spirals over the indigo Star Hill craters and to Castle grounds where
it dumped them abruptly. The pink angled roof rapidly approaching,
Yoshi told the dragon to dive, gain speed, and quote &lsquo;pull up&rsquo;.
Positive g-forces squashed them down, the beast swooping low and then
high. He lopped off one spire of her castle and crashed into the
garden. Everyone was catapulted off into shrubbery and silver sand,
the by-product of the asteroids.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ingesting
the particles like dust, Luigi coughed, rolling to his side.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bae.&rdquo;
An old sounding man shook him in a nagging get the heck out of bed
way. Toad was liver spotted and wrinkly, his signature clothes
wearing him, almost obscuring the Vrlrdyi Scope in his pocket. &quot;I
don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s gone on, but we gotta get out of here.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
lifted, words dying from the array of silver globs suspended over
town, like a snapshot.</font></p>
<p><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~Do
you know what that was? It&rsquo;s what you see before you die. </font></em>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
meddled and you failed like the- I'm combing through your timeline..
the loser you always were, Luigi Mario. I am tired of the universe's
vacillation and now it is over. I will be free to be the Lord of
Chaos I once was, and nothing will ever be the same! </font></em>
</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Tears
streamed from his blackened, starry eyes, not from fear, but strain.
&quot;Maybe you're right in a way. And you can call me a loser too if
you want. Get this though,&quot; he spat to the anonymous foe. &quot;This
was by the seat of my pants, and I had to rely on every friend I
had..&quot; (Or was that all of them?) &quot;You've also threatened
the wrong 'loser' because I'm not giving up.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">From a
realm Time couldn't touch, the rapidly aging plumber was pulled into
the shadows.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;m
dead?&rdquo; He gawked at the puffy aerial landscape. Civilization
was layered as the clouds were, neatly, spotted by ancient courts,
strung by red doors and moving platforms. The population was dense,
many coming and going.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
don&rsquo;t know, and I say it matters not. Your vow as a public
servant is to protect no matter what.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The whomp
stalwartly faced the nimbi. &ldquo;Why I don&rsquo;t have sympathy
for enemies.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadsworth
thrust out a scroll from an Overthere library. &ldquo;I say, you
might be surprised what our people&rsquo;s original mission was.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sergeant
Howie unenthusiastically examined the weathered scroll. There weren&rsquo;t
many lines of twice translated Shroomish at all, jumping between time
periods, yet it detailed what he&rsquo;d never seen on Earth. The
tension in his forehead telegraphed his feelings.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">See?
Empathy does align you with the Mushroom spirit, pre-corruption.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
officer slapped that paper into his chest. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find a
doctor per my obligation, old man. That&rsquo;s it. Oh, here&rsquo;s
a lead.&rdquo; He brought out the zapper again to clear his way to
new arrivals, if by accident by their spaceship flattening sacred
apple trees. They were chasing some d-man on the loose, the agent
making the clouds darken, winds kick. </font>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Not
like that!&rdquo; Toadsworth cried.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Climbing
up some withering vines, &lsquo;you can do it&rsquo;, the star kid
reassured himself. With the bars retracted over the windows, he could
shatter one high up and slip into a massive orrery room. He smashed
into the globe of one blue and green planet, was almost skewered by
additional spokes on the way down, and splat on the weathered tile
floor. This area split off to the dining room, utterly destroyed.
Supports had fallen, running portraits, tables and chairs, and other
valuables. On the way however, a cosmic chain on a prohibited room
piqued his interest. He&rsquo;d never seen anything like it, thorned,
too strong to snap.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Anyone
h-hear me?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Yes!
Help! Oh please help us!...&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">If
the Legendary Captain could be located, so can your daughter.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
are too kind Heinemann,..&rdquo; Out in the once Elysian fields, Nass
had just discontinued the chest compressions on Ludwig. &ldquo;Though,
that was the sort of lip service common with my old colleagues.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Understood.&rdquo;
The bespectacled toad&rsquo;s face fell. &ldquo;Perhaps neither of us
could easily return to our old professions, but it&rsquo;s too early
to toss away all prospects. ..Or I&rsquo;m simply optimistic.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She met
his gaze. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something else I-&ldquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Twink
sprung off the porch, tumbling between them. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s super
strong? I need them inside!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
Captain barreled over Twink, disappeared for a second, then crawled
back out, gagging.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There&rsquo;s
treasure in there, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Banktoad brought up.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mailtoad
bereaved himself of his prized satchel, tying some of the ripped
leather around The Captain&rsquo;s head as a blindfold. &ldquo;I,
umm, hope that&rsquo;ll work.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Soo-kh!&rdquo;
Banktoad ordered. That appeared to work, neither their captain nor
the star kid with footprints all over him returning. &ldquo;Great
job, Mail. No wonder Yellow crushes on you.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
postman slowly collected his letters, feeling himself flush. &ldquo;J&ouml;rg
mentioned that to you?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">To
Stanley in a dream invasion.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The purple
toad stood. &ldquo;..William. You&rsquo;d better not lie considering
where we are. Why&rsquo;d you let your uncle run you mad like this?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He&rsquo;s
subject to a lot of my intrusive thoughts, ministry boy.&rdquo; Bank
bumped him humoredly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all. What did Yellow
insinuate?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">More.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
won&rsquo;t say because I&rsquo;m a &lsquo;ministry boy&rsquo;. Ask
him.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Together
they faced where the yellow capped culprit might be, marked by his
snoring and the subtle bristle of the white field. Now the entire lot
was blown flat, the same force tipping the platform, flicking
everybody off the ground like a flea.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hate
to interrupt this requiem- naw, I bloody love to.&rdquo; Dark Ztar
laughed maniacally.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Let&rsquo;s
resolve this.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He was
done absorbing the color inverted world, ghastly &lsquo;freaks&rsquo;
to most, but to him merely alternative forms on their daily business,
crossing signs and landmarks. Beyond the weeping willows and
tombstones, was Toad Town, except it wasn&rsquo;t.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
overdue.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He focused
squarely on Booigi on the curb. &ldquo;Yeah. That dream sequence went
off the rails. Now, I don&rsquo;t want us to hit a reset. We&rsquo;d
already done that when we met at the tennis game. I broke a promise,
and sent you to the slaughter but-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The boo&rsquo;s
eyes narrowed. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Concerned,
Luigi stopped against the newsstand, filled with Booish language
papers. &ldquo;Then-&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
my fault and it&rsquo;s a good thing you didn&rsquo;t mess with me
earlier. I may have more regrets right now..&rdquo; Boo lightly spun
in their grasp the green Bowser racket, inflamed with the fury of
their ancestors. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to abate me with more
explanations. Just tell me what I need to do in the real world.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
breathed in, thinking it out. One glance up and.. &ldquo;Buddy, since
you want it truncated, you&rsquo;ll have to try it out in this one.&rdquo;</font></p>
<hr/>

<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Halt!&rdquo;
Star Spirits shot out of the temple, using all of their forces, the
lullabies, star storms, chill outs, up &amp; away, the.. Actually not
the smooch, not that Misstar&rsquo;s hesitance appeared to matter.
Without Eldstar they could not star beam the fiend, only ruin their
home more. Observatory, plane, and temple separated, leaving the
sapphire to all fracture in pieces with whoever was on it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Twink hid
behind the paper remnants as long as he could, taking a thick phone
pole sized spear to whack it across the back of Dark Ztar&rsquo;s
head. While knocked forward, he recovered, grabbed the star kid and
punted him over the guardian&rsquo;s heads, demolishing the left half
of the temple.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Pick
on somebody your own size!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Don&rsquo;t
take the bait!-&rdquo; Klevar warned.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Muskular
and the crazed cousin arm wrestled, grunting.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
are a tough bastard! Not enough!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Shut
up, Zach. -Ah!&rdquo; The blue sailor hat wearing star spirit simply
hadn&rsquo;t the chance to warm up. The family cringed as Dark Ztar
slapped his hand against the ground so hard, he cracked through the
platform. In addition to the area becoming one big debris cloud,
their toughest, heaviest star was plunged into a black hole. The
family went silent, staring.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">For the
girl in a white flowy dress, having some fresh air couldn&rsquo;t
subside the dread in her. Odd geometries, vivid colors, unexpected
discoveries that came with traveling the cosmos- so captivating in
the past, now were pointed reminders of her displacement. She kicked
her legs off the edge of the ship's rounded sides, wondering how
she&rsquo;d admit this when the apricot luma returned.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Attention,
whatever scientific principles are at play here, submit to the Koopa
Empire, or you shall be skirting along to another planet!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The girl
staggered to her feet, the invader&rsquo;s mechanicalized pidget
carpet blocking her starshroom. There were koopas back home, never
that big and frightening. The stranger passed over a document as if
it was burning a hole in his hand, King Ludwig Von Koopa to be exact,
suited up in a navy jacket full of glimmering gold medals.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well?&rdquo;
He sighed. &ldquo;I should have left reconnaissance to King Roy and
the fighter jets.. Don&rsquo;t you know where you are?!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The girl
turned, seeing for the first time the world she hovered over. It was
blue and greenish, Earth ostensibly, but not one she belonged to. All
of the themed lands were free to embrace their original traditions.
She only wished she knew what any of this meant, especially the
strict order to &lsquo;eschew contemporary Mushroomy ideology&rsquo;.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Just as
King Ludwig was about to call reinforcements on this silly, probably
Mushroom aligned girl, a roof panel opened with a hiss and release of
mist.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig,
Rosalina, no time to explain. Wake up. You&rsquo;re dying!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">While
Ludwig didn&rsquo;t see the partner in crime, he heard him, accented
like him, and his late mother.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Where was
he? Where? Giving up, Millennium Star didn&rsquo;t want to look at
that Earth Geno was so didactic over. If by Eldstar&rsquo;s will,
seedy individuals must exist, why was he wrong to mold them into
tools?</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He was
jolted from those musings by a sting in the back. He narrowly avoided
the barrage of his Casualty bands lobbed into the air. The trick
shots that hit him didn&rsquo;t hurt as much as losing altitude, a
byproduct of his distracted acrobatics. He was being attacked by an
additional psionic source, and it terrified him.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi was
conscious of being dragged across Peach&rsquo;s lawn with a bloodied
nose, so he hadn&rsquo;t whittled to dust. Great, though with
everything in slow motion, he couldn&rsquo;t warn his friends of the
falling star. The impact was somewhere behind Peach&rsquo;s Castle,
but the shockwave normal, possibly triple speed. He was slung as far
as Royal Raceway, his vision going entirely fluorescent traffic cone
orange.</font></p>
<hr/>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Emerging
from the coma-like state, he was too weak to thrash, reaching for the
closest thing. It was smooth, trying to slap him with a fin. Donald
looked at the nimbi crossly, caught on, and then kept swimming with
him. Tired of holding his breath, and lost in the scraps of paper and
indistinguishable pieces of the temple dispersed everywhere in space,
he could use the assistance. Ludwig was pointing his wing behind Dark
Ztar as he approached the shocked silent star guardians.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
monochrome star fired off an over the shoulder warning shot at the
d-Man fluttering over. Refitting his glasses, the agent of Queen
Jaydes wasn&rsquo;t deterred. Dark Ztar easily maneuvered from
whatever the d-man threw, whatever it was invisibly striking Eldstar
on the stretcher.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The elder
made the first groan he had since being secured, turning to his side,
choking up heaps of dark matter into the mist of the fields. That got
his family animated, rushing over to his side.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Nice
shot, bloke!&rdquo; Dark Ztar shook the blackened cretin&rsquo;s
hand. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never shaken me down before. Must be new.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
accountant nodded, sweat dripping from their heavy brow. &ldquo;Yeah.
Could use some side work tho.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Are
you more than fifty percent sane? If so brilliant.&rdquo;</font></p>

it. Never mind.&rdquo; He took the villain&rsquo;s card, slouched
over. &ldquo;Besides, I don't think that was my death ray. It was
missing that energizing aftermath. If anything I&rsquo;m depleted!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dark
Ztar&rsquo;s smile dropped like rock, swiveling around. The epitome
of fairness, Eldstar, stood with some support, soft features twisting
in disappointment.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Tongue
tied now? Zoo Diddley learned how to Refresh from your conspirator,
Zachary.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">N-no.

face. &ldquo;He ruined me!!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Who?
That one?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A saucer
shaped spaceship zipped by, commotion visible from the curved visor
window. The whomp fought with Prof. X-Naut over ray guns, Dr. Toad
and Toadsworth fussed over controls, and Johnson on crutches could do
little but flick on the tractor beam for Zoo and the other
stragglers.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-No,
I meant. Milly!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His
comeuppance has come, Zachary. Here is something you cannot deflect
for once,&rdquo; Eldstar declared, voice strong.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
monochrome star obtained color from the holy white light beam above,
stamping him through the last sapphire slab. The black hole spat out
Muskular as gravity shifted. He grabbed Dark Ztar in his dazed state
and pile drove him into the void, where it collapsed onto itself. The
wicked star&rsquo;s screams faded before the light dissipated, and
the cleansed temple, what tiny bit remained floating in space, began
to sparkle and shine. Simultaneously, the Observatory&rsquo;s beacon
reignited above their heads, turning right side up.</font></p>

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Geno
resolved to get here and destroy evil if it was the last thing he

her station.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Eldstar

<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Chirping
birds and patchy light gently coaxed the man under the tree to stand
up. Dizzily, he abandoned the crumbled traffic cone, leaving dew
covered grass for the paved, slightly sloped downwards raceway. The
electronic banner tacked to the banisters stated the temperature, a
tire advert, and the date. For the first time ever, he thanked God it
was Monday.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">In Toad
Town there were karts passing by, and foot traffic on the sidewalks.
No riots, nothing burned down. North at Peach&rsquo;s Castle, he grew
less anesthetic. The four-hundred year old stronghold was sturdy,
beautiful and vibrant, not a sandstone tile on the ground path even
cracked, but behind it.. He fought off that bout of faintness, the
sound of a motorcycle drowning out his thoughts.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Did
you sleep out here? No wonder..&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
looked him over funny while looking funny. Or, he wore casual clothes
on at least, sans the boots, which he&rsquo;d never not wear.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi kept
it to, &ldquo;I always was a star gazer..&rdquo;<br/>
He accepted
Mario&rsquo;s burnt toast, the older brother not about to take him
anywhere on the Mach Bike than towards the castle. Luigi crunched on
it without complaint. Star Hill, holy grounds of the Mushroom
Kingdom, wasn&rsquo;t on the horizon.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The indigo
rocky landscape held a new secret. The vent previously spewing an
unlimited supply of starbits was plugged by an eldritch five pointed
being. No one could get close enough to look at it directly. That&rsquo;s
all they knew down at the star summit path gate via a drone a toad
flew up there. And a Lakitu Bro that almost died earlier. Late to the
party, Luigi didn&rsquo;t want to instigate. What if he said the
wrong thing and willed one of them out of existence again?</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He did
have one safe question for the princess, in a tank top and shorts.
&ldquo;What do you think your dad thinks about this?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
remained as calm as one could. &quot;I imagine he&rsquo;s more
worried about protecting his old factory with a single sword.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Don&rsquo;t
bring one of those to a gunfight.&rdquo; Toadsworth winked at the
green plumber. He appeared very odd, but no one commented on it.</font></p>
<p>Luigi yearned for some outlet, like a dam about to break. He determined that everyone was going to hear about what he saw. Eventually. Later on the patio their company, ethereal or not, warmed by the sun's sprawling rays, he mentioned that he hadn't seen Toad yet. He was dragged away for campaigning matters Peach replied, about as casually as it slipped that the cruiser she was about to visit was Daisy's. In the regal yet dogeared letter to Luigi, Toad reiterated that sudden eight in the morning intrusion by auditors except with more colorful language, calling him bae at the end. Luigi was against himself starting to like that. Idly, he folded it into a paper plane.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
swear I didn&rsquo;t see them!&rdquo; The driver of the black Lexus
settled for using her words after communicating more than she needed
to by bumping dozens of the wooden traffic rerouting barrels.</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jr. Troopa
leered into her car. His face mask wasn&rsquo;t all that fearsome,
but the light blue smock actually showed off his arms, and she&rsquo;d
better heed that. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re Mecha-Yoshi lanes.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Troopa,
come on!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jackson.
No pet names. Not with my boss coming down soon and he&rsquo;s the
sort to wear fedoras.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And
that means.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Nothin.
Next time Victor will send you a bill for scratching those barrels.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
are tripping, brother.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She sped
off, leaving him with the next one on foot.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Are
you taking applications? I&rsquo;ll live here soon,&rdquo; The ruddy
dark spotted toad had a low super posh tone, contrasting her baggy
traditional country clothing. She must have been dropped off by a bus
or something, those sneaky bastards. &ldquo;Imma marksman, when
drafts went out I held off my five bigger sisters, I'm trying to
learn guitar, and I got this, eh.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She opened
a brown leather messenger bag. Jr. Troopa was prepared for anything
but that.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
clock, pard? -I mean ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">..Haha,
actually it catches Red Chomps in Neon Heights after a player has
landed on&hellip;&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The Lexus
proceeded to park far away from the prestigious Mushroom Kingdom East
hospital before venturing in, in case the reporter&rsquo;s mark had a
window room. At the automatic doors was a posted neon green sign:
&lsquo;All welcome including baddies.&rsquo; So nice, like the toad
lady greeting her on the way in. She had a hanging badge, marking
&lsquo;Mariam&rsquo; as a guide of sorts. Kylie avoided eye contact
with any others as reception desks, nurses pushing around carts, and
doctors. No matter how &lsquo;critical&rsquo; his condition was per
hearsay, he could have these folks probed for all she knew, double
checking her tin foil helmet under her signature cap.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
scammed a dang god.&rdquo; She shut the heavy door of room 444 behind
her, facing the patient on the bed steely. &ldquo;Millennium Star&rsquo;s
gonna suffer as long as you do.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The green
toad remained motionless, a plethora of computers tapped into him.
His body was intact at least, and expression peaceful. She hadn&rsquo;t
picked apart his prognosis papers yet.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Be
honest with me Mitch.&rdquo; She sat on the stool with a squeak.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on? ..Well, you should know that your
insurance lets me handle your crap. I took all of your research on
that star stuff, hear? Not to Dr. Toadley. Too close if you ever
patch yourself up.&rdquo; She made the stool spin as he lifted off
restlessly. Better skedaddle before one of five practitioners
assigned to this mysterious case walked in. &ldquo;This doc you&rsquo;ll
never touch. In fact, I barely can.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Finally,
I get cha. Packet received?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
are still forwarding shipments from the Special World branch, but..
Yes I see it was marked &lsquo;urgent urgent urgent god please look
at this stuff..&rsquo;&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Good.
Phew!..&rdquo; Her shell rested against the leather seat. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
be easier with a direct address.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There
isn&rsquo;t one here, making it ideal for a third facility.
Possibly.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She heard
the sounds of branches snapping. Dr. Toad was on the move, from the
bob-omb shaped alien landing pad, to the wide open stone and moss
covered ruins. His artist's eye was pleased, vibrant colors, flutters
so large he'd swore Morris hit them with a growth ray.. Oh but
following that ridiculous space journey, he had extras on board to
deal with, certainly not a great time to be micromanaged at that by
publicists.</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Drew,
can I call ya that? Should I call back? When won&rsquo;t you be busy?</font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">"No you may not, yes you can, in theory, and there is never a moment when I am unoccupied." The toad doctor stood against tall moai figures. If he lingered too long, some of his mischievous passengers might get the unwise idea to swipe an artifact or write him a citation, space-lagged or not.  "Kylie, let me be clear. Circumstances have placed me in an ultra-classified location, so do not worry. Mitch's research on stars will fit right in with Mystery Land."</font></p>
<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His prophesy of far-reaching fame striking her like lightning, she screamed.</font></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>"-I have a lot to learn about myself, so when not on community service I'll try to get out more, with or without a Mario invite."</p>

<p>"I respect that, Boo. Talk to you later." Luigi closed his usually dormant, now constantly buzzing from anonymous praise text app.</p>

<p>Overtaking a Mushroom Bus full of tourists for Koopa Fortress, the bikers pulled into their gravel driveway. Peach let them go, she needed to pack. Who wouldn't, Luigi added. The neighborhood was tranquil, which made it not very much. Next door, Gill T.'s lights were on, the Bullet Blaster covered up and with a flat. If Mario kept speaking so loud on the phone, he might learn right away if that was a Gill T. or a Ghost T. occupying that spot now.</p>

<p>"Sorry. Bowser wants to do some stuff with his WHOLE family," Mario explained, unlocking their home. "I know, my ears are still ringing too.."</p>

<p>Stepping into the dark den, it was cleanish the younger brother estimated. He hadn't tripped yet and Mario only crunched on one unknown object before flicking the light.</p>

<p>"-So it's a go?"</p>

<p>"Totally bro."</p>

<p>"Great, Luigi. Just to make a lot of the transitions easier. Oh right." He chuckled dryly. "We're reinstituting the Peace Pact again."</p>

<p>Again. So.. maybe there was a lot less to explain than he thought, Luigi realized, hanging up his hat, biting back tears from- something he couldn't identify yet.</p>

<p>Mario continued, rummaging in the kitchen to toss some mercy scraps of bacon on a pan for Luigi. The unhealthy kind the castle doesn't stock.. "Yeah. So round two on that. Er, maybe I shouldn't make light of.. (Is Bowser rubbing off that quick?) Anyway, tour agent 'Sonny' wore me down before I picked you up. Said he was promoted and we can use a private beach his company owns. Seemed sketchy to me too until Yosh vouched for him. Maybe we can get Peach and Daisy on that boat to meet up and give us free food, heh heh."</p>

<p>Luigi lingered at the coat rack, back turned. "T-that's.. that's more than palatable to me. Wait, except for the food-snatching part. How'd we- or how'd it come about?"</p>

<p>Mario collapsed back on the couch, twirling his goatee. "Extreme sports didn't feel right, no racing or tennis or anything. For this week we needed something active but scenic where we all chill out. I came up with the perfect thing. Digging for treasure!"</p>

<p>Luigi screamed.</p>

<p>"But it was vetoed!" Mario cried, "Kinda.. forgot for a sec that's how it all started."</p>

<p>The brothers stared perplexedly before laughter filled that block of Pleasant Path.</p>
