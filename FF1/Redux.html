<h2>Chapter 1: Go-Karting With Bowser</h2>
<p>
  <em>~Zoom! A mushroom-powered racer in fourth makes a detour for a trick ramp, soaring across the sky, a picture-perfect sweep of their silhouette across the moon. Snap! A photo was taken. Then- Screech! The camera pans. The racer in eighth overshoots a tight curve, sparks flying from the impact against sturdy rails, just separating them from death. The racer aft of them, not so fortunate, simply falls right off. The view swivels quickly. Many meters ahead, the first-place racer is alerted by a shrill ping of heat-seeking red shells. Expertly, all are dodged~</em>
</p>

<p>All par for the course of 'Mario Kart'. Heroes, villains, and everyone in between invited by the famous plumber competed on streets, dirt trails, underwater, through sand, snow, and whatever Cheese Land was supposed to be for arbitrary prizes. It was more about the stakes-free association, where those labels were inconsequential. Mario let everyone think the infamous track of Rainbow Road had no significance, but he wanted to leave Earth for a bit, where ironically he was breathing better. A Special Cup circuit, the track was as intimidating as it was a sight to behold, a 2,000m ribbon-like band perpetually suspended high in the stratosphere, no extra charge for the starry light show in the background. Only the occasional rail and Lakitu's diligence separated the racers from certain doom! Or that was what Mario and co told MKTV at least. As for the racer in the Bullet Blaster front running, the danger was real. -And that danger was the lack of it.</p>

<p>Mario sat up a little straighter in the paddled leather seat, wondering if he should sandbag. Checking his map, there was a blip breaking from the pack, zoning in. He peeped at their face from the mirror, scrunched up and knotty, red eyes narrowed, gripping so tightly on the wheel it might snap in half. Mario never knew zippy little Pipe Frame karts could withstand the abuse of King Bowser Koopa, and that would be the least of his surprises.</p>

<p>Hearing the alarm of red shells, there was that trouble the red plumber pined for. Dealing with an anti-gravity section simultaneously, his snaking technique to outwit the shells went awry, brakes locking up as he skidded out of the spiral. Hitting the normal track again, the red missile struck a banana instead of him and he was unscathed after all, just with company revving up parallel.</p>

<p>"Thanks for keeping first place warm for me, Mustache! Ha ha!" Bowser held position, wafting dark smoke on him, and losing a few bolts. In exchange for the ability to slam everyone around, though collisions had occurred judging by the scrapes in the orange paint job, the king had the acceleration to recover from mistakes and balanced stats elsewhere to be strategic.</p>

<p>"Be careful what you wish for," Mario chuckled. "Wouldn't wanna overheat." He tossed over a fireball he'd been saving. Bowser's mug was priceless as he spun out. Catching a break though, a booster panel caught him right back up, or close enough to ogle Mario's choice of vehicle suddenly.</p>

<p>"-Did you rent that thang from the hangar? I was stalking that place ALL DAY and I never saw ya," he approached casually.</p>

<p>No wonder there were complaints about that.. "A local friend," the plumber answered on his shoulder. "You wouldn't know him."</p>

<p>"What?!" Bowser must have slammed against the wheel, making a brief honk. "I know all of your pals- you know, to use against you at some point obviously, so who's this friend of yours that I don't know?!"</p>

<p>Mario pretended to be too focused on racing. The 'friend' was Gill T. Their neighbor back home had a famous way back when anti-koopa single out and it might get awkward.</p>

<p>"Fine! This'll help ya remember."</p>

<p>After Bowser slapped a bob-omb in his way, Mario swerved for a trick ramp. Bouncing off of it and winning a single banana from an item box, he realized all of his buffoonery had allowed more racers to catch up for the final lap.</p>

<p>"Woohoo!"</p>

<p>Boosted by golden mushrooms, Toad zoomed past Mario and Bowser's stunned faces, traveling far until he spun out on stray bananas. A green dinosaur, also green at operating motored karts and yet a natural at it anyway, took a mushroom-less shortcut to insert himself in the top three slots. Mario kept an eye on his best friend, aft and to the left of him in a Wild Wing with the hazard lights unintentionally flashing. Yes unintentionally. T. Yoshisaur was like their grandpa, except one that 'crept' at 90 mph instead of 9. He and Mario tended to not target each other, so it was the other encroaching racer to worry about. Hitching a free ride beyond most with a bullet bill item and barreling beyond Yoshi, if poofed into Bowser Junior in a Rally Romper.</p>

<p>Dreading being sandwiched between two Bowsers, Mario took the longer path of the fork in the road on purpose. He needed better items to cut through this dense bunch on the narrowing vivid roads. A hyper-speed thundercloud victim ignored Koopa, a local jogger, Toadette of Peach Castle, Luigi Mario who was.. Mario hoped everyone knew by then, Donkey Kong a rare VIP guest, and Birdo from the mysterious Subcon, to hunt him down specifically. Mario shuddered. Some said he had the floor of the castle all to himself to contain his crazy! Mario wildly weaved around to shake him before executing a last-ditch maneuver. He darted off the side and plopped down on a lower section of the track, rear tires barely making it.</p>

<p>"Phew!"</p>

<p>Mario craned over to Bowser.</p>

<p>"I mean, good riddance," he ranted at his side. "Those losers were stealing the spotlight! It's all about OUR rivalry ain't it?"</p>

<p>The plumber felt his hair rise. What a profound statement. Or maybe-</p>

<p>Thunder clapped. <b>ZAP!</b> Rainbow Road was shrouded by a flash so bright it was seen deep into the heavens.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>
  <em>"Lightning Strike? Y/N?"</em>
</p>

<p>The Great Eldstar tapped 'yes' on the pager and tossed it into a cubby near the throne, missing horrendously and sending the thing clacking on his white marbled floors, batteries rolling. Groaning, more from the headache than that mishap no one saw anyway, the star dropped to his feet.</p>

<p>"This is so exciting!" chimed from behind his half-ajar door. A star kid at work today, Twink. "But, can I change my bet?"</p>

<p>"Hm. What did you wager?" replied one of the ancients, Klevar, arms filled with formidable books.</p>

<p>A pause. "My allowance."</p>

<p>"Oof, you gotta be! -Ah hem, oh dear. Hold this will you?... Thank you. I'll ensure Misstar won't leave you penniless, but let this be a lession."</p>

<p>"Yay thanks! ..Wait we don't use pennies up here.."</p>

<p>Eldstar watched the pair stroll past his doorway, armed with more context. The racer that requested such divine assistance was unusually versed in the stars...</p>

<p>A miniaturized Mario came too, afterimages blotting out all but the peripherals of his vision. Blindly he overtook Bowser and remained lead-footed, remembering that there was one last curve before the finish line when weightlessness followed by a hard tug startled him. His vision was returning as Lakitu's rod hauled him back on track. Bowser's smug grin, baring sharp white teeth as he drove by was infuriating, though as solace no confetti erupted for him seconds later. The racer in the experimental, unregistered, not even finished pink yet like it was inevitably going to be, kart was all but forgotten in the back of the pack, a true sandbagger. Mario knew he should have just gone for that.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Princess Peach blew kisses at the crowd, especially Mario, heading over the medal. She was suited for racing and pristine, unlike the rest of the scorched racers packing up as MKTV sidestepped them and circled the sovereign of the Mushroom Kingdom and blurted out questions.</p>

<p>"...I have no secrets I suppose." She flipped her hair, a little tense, and summed it up. "I simply, try my best."</p>

<p>They moved on to Mr. Toad, sporting a silver medallion. Mario couldn't spot him anymore behind those Jugem's clouds, though he understood why he was the next victim of the paparazzo gang. The Toad of Toads was seen more as a celebrity than a saint like Peach, though in a poorly elaborated way, Mario recalled that his stature was so lothly half the kingdom was his ancestral property. Or someone made that up. Anyway, the third-place winner was not exactly a no-show, more like a not-yet. Sliding shut and locking up the metal doors of the garage, baking under those bright stadium lights, Mario was eager to skip out of there, an agitated and ambivalent at once feeling settling in his stomach. Luigi was carpooling with some others to meet up with Daisy, due to arrive early morning in Toad Town, so he'd have to drive home with only worn cassette tapes as his company.</p>

<p>"There you freaking are!" The ambusher's huge spiky shadow enveloped the plumber.</p>

<p>Mario spun into the Koopa King, with another future one on his shoulders, the child distracted at the moment with a bag of lemon candy from the nearest snack machine, otherwise filled with stale space food or soda. This domestic imagery on display was another way Bowser was breaking trends these days. That facet of him was intriguing. Too much.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>Mario scrambled to untuck the trinket from within his shirt. "Ease up! I can't play tomorrow if you pulverize me first."</p>

<p>"Did I yell then? Thought I didn't." Bowser appeared to genuinely mean that as he snatched the medal away, handing it to Junior to play around with. Mario could have sworn his trophy case was filled with cobwebs lately. "So 'bout that game. What is it?"</p>

<p>"Tennis."</p>

<p>"-Well you play a million. Hard to keep up. Anyway, I wanted to talk to ya about that. Come on." Bowser made his way off into the rocky Star Road landscape. The plumber stared for a second then ran up.</p>

<p>"H-huh?"</p>

<p>"This pact thing was perfect, obviously 'cause it came from me and my ideas are great!"</p>

<p>"-The pact was my idea, Bowser."</p>

<p>"Whatever. I really like this hanging around ya and terrifying your folks in person instead of you crushing my castles or us having to resort to those secret phone conversations-"</p>

<p>Mario tripped on his own feet in that moment, kicking in the process a big rock that went 'ouch!'</p>

<p>"Why I oughta.." The Moon Cleft charged, shuffling under Mario's boots as he lept over them.</p>

<p>Disappearing behind the lip of a crater, Mario landed with a roll and scoped around rapidly- at least until someone broke the tension.</p>

<p>"Ha! Where was that reaction time during the race?"</p>

<p>Mario rolled his eyes, swatting at the moon dust on his kneecaps. "Good question.."</p>

<p>"Can I try that too?" Junior hopped off of his papa's shell, slipping away from him to chase the baddie. At least Mario got a laugh in return as Bowser tried to scoop him up and missed, falling flat on his face.</p>

<p>"You know, since you sent that tyke to Koopa Scouts instead of having your evil grandpa, no offense- Kamek watch him, his behavior was almost normal. Maybe not."</p>

<p>"Grrr..." Bowser crawled back up. "Shut your trap before I decide to send you home via cannon."</p>

<p>The drone of an airship approaching masked Mario's quip. Huge Doomships, dreadnoughts with propellers, cacophonic, with a tendency to list erratically, they hadn't been spotted in ages.</p>

<p>"Get on!" Bowser yelled in his ear, waving over as an anchor was lowered and promptly smashed into the roof of one of the auxiliary garages. Lakitu and space toads scurried out screaming for their lives. "Whoops!.. I got the rookies driving this one, not my kids. You understand right?"</p>

<p>"I don't!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I don't!!!!"</p>

<p>"What????" Bowser secured the plumber by both sides and raised him to his level. "Now what?"</p>

<p>"Don't do this!" Mario squirmed, flushing.</p>

<p>"Well I couldn't catch what cha was sayin!"</p>

<p>"Not the hugging part. I mean- yeah this part too, but I can't let people see me in your airship!"</p>

<p>Bowser dropped him with a flash of offense, folding his arms. "What was the point of YOUR Peace Pact then? Mr. Hero is scared of people spottin ya with your old enemy?... Point is- why can't we just hang out?!"</p>

<p>Mario's gaze slid over to the stretch of land devoid of development, where lunar terrain met twinkling stars and there were no clefts or yux or other aliens patrolling. If he was to have an unfettered walk that way, forgetting everything he was up until now, the zen just might overshadow his regrets, and that sent a shiver through him.</p>

<p>Bowser snapped his fingers in his face, staring at him funny. Mario stared harder though, because beyond the Koopa King was a roaring inferno. The doomship scrapped across the tin roof and the sparks lit the gasoline stored around. Maybe that wasn't a best practice in retrospect, but it wasn't exactly easy to start a fire in an oxygen-deprived area either. Bowser and minions were special like that. Following impact the ship plunged into the ground, shook them off their feet, and careened off a cliff, bow stabbing a corner of Rainbow Road, which shattered like glass. Propellers broke and the engines were cut, everything silent.</p>

<p>"This is why." Sighing, Mario brushed beyond Bowser to rush over and help in any way he could.</p>

<p>Bowser watched for a moment and then knew what to do. He whipped over to his child, moon jumping with a toy K64 replica in hand. "Junior, quick! Gimme your sketch pad."</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Keep your friends close and enemies closer. Merely some stock quote in the past, when having a romp across enemy-filled kingdoms was so exhilarating he refused salary until the Mushroom folks forced him to and built the brothers a fantastic house in a prestigious sector of the town, it was a reality now and the sword of Damocles swung inches above his head. He was the 'flawless' paragon of one side and the 'irredeemable' enemy of the other. 'These nations shall never quarrel again', the pact stated and technically they weren't, but Mario forgot about another war, raging intensely in a hidden place.</p>

<p>Leaving the Star Road ER late, thankful to the stars that the smoke didn't make the MK staff croak too badly or make him hit the ground blue in the face from asthma, a skittish nurse flagged him down on the way out, passing along a letter. The written in crayon part is what really made it deranged:</p>

<p>
  <em>"To Mario only (OR ELSE): This is 'You know who'. I really didn't mean to screw with those no-name extra losers. You know I only do that with people that are special to me! I'll make it up to you with this genius plan. I'll be your tennis partner tomorrow and when we win, I'll say I'm donating the proceeds or some crap. You get to look good, cause you even got someone like me to do something nice. (Note: I'm not doing something nice. I'm JUST pretending) and I get a [this part scratched out] trophy for once.- MORE trophies for my overfilled case. I've already threatened all the organizers to switch it around, don't worry about that. Get ready!"</em>
</p>

<p>Blanched, Mario folded the letter up. His original- no Bowser wasn't about to railroad him. His real tennis partner was-</p>

	Before Koopas</font></h2>
	<p>
  <em>'You have one new message.' *Beep*</em>
</p>

<p>Mario's eyelids slowly opened as the voicemail buzzed from the Yoshimobile on the stand between the beds, the tiredness raking through him not enough to shut out his Pavlovian response to wake up when his phone did anything. It was distributed widely for emergencies after all:</p>

<p>"Hey loser, wake up call from: 'You Know Who'!" ~Loud orchestral music was in the background of the gravelly voice. "Friendly reminder for ya: we gotta win, or the Special Cup's gonna be incomplete. You know my castles in that cup right? Oh, and that charity thing or whatever. There will be more surprises when I show up, kay? Bwa ha ha!"</p>

<p>Mario sprang up, white covers flying.</p>

<p>"-Last thing before I run outta time. What's the recipe for that dessert you can't eat alone? Huh? Uh.. Oh the Couples Cake- Gramps, get lost, this ain't him on the line again.." *mumbling * "Gotta go. Keep that touchscreen smokin'!"</p>

<p>
  <em>*Beep* 'End of message. You have no new messages.'</em>
</p>

<p>Some white blanket-covered monster hummed. It slid to the ground, Mario shrinking under a disappointed little brother's gaze. "Why did I beat you to the house last night again?"</p>

<p>"Daisy made it safe?" Mario yawned, swinging his legs over the edge of the bed. He had a plan and if done right he might not earn a slap upside the head.</p>

<p>"Y-yeah. Sure. Or barely, because Daze insisted on being the helicopter pilot and she merely landed on top of us.." The other plumber in the green pajamas leaned against the door frame, paling. "And then to compound it, you stumbled in and collapsed in bed without a word, tossing and turning for the rest of the morning."</p>

<p>Mario stood, rolling his shoulders. "Snore like a jet engine too?"</p>

<p>Luigi sighed. "Remarkably not, without your mask."</p>

<p>"So that nebulizer as the ER worked.." he thought out loud.</p>

<p>Luigi dropped the blanket. "You were hospitalized?!"</p>

<p>"No. Outpatient. -It's Bowser's fault, and he's gonna get an earful when he arrives-"</p>

<p>"Bowser's coming?!"</p>

<p>"No!" Mario squeezed by, or tried to. "Well, yes, but no I have it under control. Sure, he threatened the organizers and sponsors but-"</p>

<p>"Bureaucratic corruption too?!"</p>

<p>"NO! I mean- But it's fine. He's not replacing you as my tennis partner."</p>

<p>Luigi's trepidation ebbed away, eyeing him blankly. "That's what this was about?"</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>"It's worth how much?"</p>

<p>Luigi settled on a memory foam seat cushion. "I found it underneath your complete-in-box copy of Wind Waker. Guess."</p>

<p>"-Eh, value's moot for us anyway. I'll just donate it." Mario dragged an iron ornate chair over, seating himself on the other side of the kitchen table.</p>

<p>Their little wooden cottage was warm and cozy already from the morning sun. Birds chirped outside and the thick green grass of the yard was coated in dew. Any time other than breakfast they loved to eat out there, because indoors the picturesque model home image fell apart at the seams. Such a great house, possibly the best single-story one in the Western suburb of Toad Town, with four bedrooms and a large basement, yet a terrible problem snuck up on the two. There was no room for guests to sleep over anymore because various gifts to the hero of the kingdom occupied that space. None of the hoard was dead, dying, or moldy, most often than not new in packaging, but neither knew how to rectify this without a huge spectacle, short of their mirrored avoidance tactics. Luigi visited the castle enough for it to be a second home, often in the study rooms or elsewhere within the chambers where the relative vacancy was almost eerie, and Mario took their Mach Bike and offroaded a ton.</p>

<p>While Mario was certainly getting more fresh air than he was, Luigi was certain he had a clearer head at the moment. He didn't pretend their overfilling on occasion mailbox was invisible, privy to all letters, including ones with the return address of-</p>

<p>He lowered his morning Toad Town news, eyebrows furrowing. "Are you prepared to discuss the Elle in the room now? Does Bowser really think he's your.. friend or- something?"</p>

<p>Mario took his plate to the sink. "He's fixing everything he messed up, including those expensive anti-gravity panels on Rainbow Road-"</p>

<p>Luigi face palmed.</p>

<p>"I didn't mention that either?.." Mario muttered curses under his breath. "Alright. New new plan. We-"</p>

<p>"Hold on." Luigi took the dish away, opting for the dishwasher. "I'll clean up here. Just pack for the game."</p>

<p>Mario nodded, wandering off into one of the pathways they'd carved. "I know. A fan just gave me a new Lazy Shell and-"</p>

<p>"Not to fight Bowser. I mean, I know you could and win but you'll get a pyrrhic victory at best and he'll walk with the satisfaction of ruining the day. Bowser has infiltrated your head and you have to return the favor by not falling into his trap," he explained like a tactician. "Pull the rug from him, even if..." Luigi bumped the dishwasher door close, locking eyes with him. "That means that I don't play after all."</p>

<p>Mario backed against a wall of boxed Mini-Marios, not entirely on purpose, but he made it look that way. "-We had a winning streak going in doubles! Sure?"</p>

<p>"Affirmative, and when Bowser looks like a fool, it will be immortalized. Trust me." Luigi slipped away, down another corridor.</p>

<p>Mario fancied himself a great biker, just not so much within city limits. Traffic was light, though he dinged the chrome accents a few times by whipping around corners too tight. They made it in one piece ultimately, in typical uniform and ready for the day to start. Luigi never revealed what he was going to do and Mario wasn't sure if he should be more alarmed by his twin holding secrets or the prospect of playing along with Bowser's latest scheme.</p>

<p>It was a sunny day in Toad Town, Mushroomites and visitors gathering for the upcoming match at the stadium. Citizens crammed their way in, passing by sidewalk vendors. The green plumber leaving the parking lot paused for the red toad at one of them. The blue drink offered on the house was chalky, likely not concocted by the castle's trained chef, though refreshing overall.</p>

<p>"...Bowser kicked you off the team?"</p>

<p>Luigi checked around discreetly, pulling his carry-on bag up on his shoulder. "Don't shout from the rooftops or act suspicious, but yes. He's way too comfortable around us now, specifically my brother. Sure I suppose that was in part the purpose of the..."</p>

<p>While Toad listened closely, his pitcher full of blue liquid overfilled a plastic cup, rolling over the edge.</p>

<p>"..And I ask Toadia, 'what? a polar bear in this region? You'd better ring Smash Mansion, where our cousin Dr. Mario is, and ask for Popo'- Hey, Toad! That's suspicious!"</p>

<p>"Hahaha. Dang." He wiped the spill with a towel. "Guess I might break a sweat for once if I'm against Bowser instead of you. Kidding! Wow. What will you do again from the bleachers?"</p>

<p>The green plumber tapped carry-on. "Capture the carnage of you and Daze smoking them! We all know Mario can take a loss with stride, but Bowser?"</p>

<p>"I'm betting on nuclear reaction. Evacuate the premises!"</p>

<p>"It's a possibility," Luigi laughed with his conspirator. They'd been in on this Mario and Bowser thing before the pact, tight like glue, only not too loud about it. Mr. Toad wasn't in his little fan club. He'd asked about that once, not out of pretentiousness or to reach some quota, genuine curiosity, and the toad merely mentioned a 'conflict of interest'. That was sound. He was the Earl of the kingdom, one humble enough to stand at a shroom shake stand in place of Toadette, who actually owned it based on the pink glittery signage and the cup of coins meant to fund the 'installation of more monuments based on indigenous fungi', but a noble the same. If Peach and Mario were never official, he could expect Mr. Toad to be his official.. Where was he going with this?..</p>

<p>"Boo!"</p>

<p>Randomly jabbed in the back, Luigi dropped his cup, spilling juice everywhere. He swung around and got that overdue slap in.</p>

<p>Mario adjusted his crooked cap. "Reflex test! Hey Toad." He waved. "Covering for your 'homegirl' eh? Does Toadette know all the participants need to be in the locker rooms in five minutes?"</p>

<p>"Shoot, yeah man." Toad dug under the stand for a megaphone. "CLOSE OUT SALE! SHROOM SHAKES HALF OFF!"</p>

<p>The Mario brothers covered their ears, sidestepping as passersby were galvanized to support Toad's or Toadette's or whoever's good cause. Once Mario was off into the grass, Princess Peach materialized to unceremoniously whisk him away in small talk. Luigi drifted closer to the street, tentatively scoping out the regal coliseum. Despite his agoraphobic tendencies at times, he respected it as more than a space for commercial and outdoor events, abandoned and trashed by nightfall. The yellow-aged brickwork commanded attention, bright from the sun, luminous in the dark, and the foundation laid long before the rest of the city sprung up around it. The jagged shape of the battlement against the blue sky was a relic of the land's feudal past, barely chipped at by enemies unlike contemporaries like Peach Castle. He retrieved from his bag a digital camera he'd been training with, snapped a few pictures, and then sprinted on for a seat as a bus pulled up to the curb and dumped more attendees.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>A dinosaur rubbed his heavy eyes, shoved around until he was tossed off into some flutter bushes. The inconvenience of traveling from Yoshi's Island to the Mushroom Kingdom by ferries, trains, and buses hardly registered to him. No matter how arduous to some commentators.. like his fiancé unfortunately.. it was worth it to support whatever Mario did.</p>

<p>On that note, he texted Birdo, staying in. According to her the best part about it was getting to ride a real wooden Gilded Prancer and of course the copious amount of rainbows, but no mention of her getting fourth. That was respectable, Yoshi preached that night. Back in Mario Kart 64, a racer could get a rare cutscene by finishing a cup at that rank! Firing off that he'd made it safe to the missus, he crossed a ransacked drink stand. From a giant pile of paper cups, a pale arm was sticking out.</p>

<p>"Sir or ma'am, are you okay?" He rushed over, tugging them out.</p>

<p>"One of those and neither at the same time. Ha. Thanks Yosh," Toad found his legs again. "More people care about unappreciated Mushroom history than I thought. -Or my last minute sale was fire. I'll imagine both."</p>

<p>Yoshi scanned the signs. "Grand. You are late, aren't you?"</p>

<p>Toad secured the proceeds, handing over a pass. "Got that right. Show this and say I said you can get a front row."</p>

<p>Yoshi was skeptical at first, nonetheless the organizers, zealous Mario fans willing to cater to any whim of the plumber's for free, didn't have a robust system and let him get a premium spot on that note alone. The clamor of the audience was unusually deafening for a reason. His old eyes were sharp as ever, and in addition to locals, plenty of 'others' were filling the bleachers opposite of his side.</p>

<p>Accurate communication was the cornerstone of advanced civilization, so logically theirs was lightyears beyond their enemy's. Ludwig Von Koopa ensured such; it was a technical marvel to receive radio signals in a region inundated with volcanoes. The Koopa Troop could relay information from one squad to dozens of others in moments, no gossiping allowed because they didn't host a forum and no one cared about anyone's opinions anyway. The dearth of sentimentality kept them focused and efficient.</p>

<p>Well, do as he said and not what he did and such jazz, because in Ludwig's opinion, the non-denominational sentient celestial bodies above sang in praise, when his music was performed or played. 'Reprisal in A minor' to be exact was playing as he shuffled closer to the auditorium. He was born that way. And by that way he meant talented. </p>

<p>"That sure was a stinker!" snorted the DJ host.</p>

<p>"The worst yet. You catch those trumpets at the end?" said another.</p>

<p>"When I wasn't dry heaving over the can!"</p>

<p>"-And that ends the 'Delusional Artist Happy Hour', your favorite comedy show on WMUSH."</p>

<p>Ludwig banged a fist against the giant golden sealed auditorium doors. "Who is in here?! Shut that blasphemous station off!" It flew open, whacking him in the face.</p>

<p>"Oh my gosh! Sorry Luddy." The rainbow-haired koopaling, younger by a year, exited on his star-branded ball, toting five bowling pins. "When I practice, I honestly don't hear the lyrics. It was background noise for me."</p>

<p>Ludwig held the discolored blotch on his snout. "General Lemmy, you cannot afford to dawdle at any moment as my secretary. I know I've warned you five-hundred and seventy-six times, but I do hope you take this five-hundred and seventy-seven one seriously. Where are the others?"</p>

<p>Lemmy kept nimbly rolling around Bowser Castle, forcing Ludwig to speedwalk to keep up. "Sleeping in late! It's a Saaaturday!~"</p>

<p>"Correct. Did I convince a particularly dull platoon to substitute for us on that doomship for nothing?"</p>

<p>Lemmy bounced down a spiraling stairwell while Ludwig lagged even more. "I'll wake em up. Oh, or get Kammy to cook that stinky thing she baked last Thursday. That'll do it!"</p>

<p>"So ein mist.." The blue-haired koopaling massaged his temple, looking down from the top. "You leave the boombox, correct?"</p>

<p>"Yeah!" the budding performer yelled up the shaft.</p>

<p>"Good!.." Ludwig stomped off, then ran back. "And remind me to track down the location of that WMUSH later! I want to bomb it. Particularly when those critics are in the building. "</p>

<p>As for now, the sports coverage was due up.</p><hr />

<p>In the dimmed locker room, Bowser threw another dart at that plumber. The metal-tipped barb dug in an inch deep, straight in the nose of the poster, crudely taped over an Air Koopa 'Just Press A' advert. Mario kept watching. It was a gag Koopsmas gift to Bowser a long time ago, so whether it was an effigy to be abused or not, it was an honor in a way that he'd held on to it. He tended to blow Bowser's castles up a lot, making his insurance premiums as high as Sky Lands' hidden village--</p>

<p>"Uh. Close the dang door?!"</p>

<p>Jolted, Mario slung his duffle bag on a bench and approached the maniac with the metal darts. Bowser's red hair was gelled back and held down by a black and red sports visor with a dark sweatband underneath. There was some color coordination somewhat, as his loosely fitting tank top was the same red of Mario's normal shirts.</p>

<p>"Bout time. Was waiting forever. Worth it though." The Koopa King spun his purple racket around, stamped with a menacing emblem. "Think we'd get this far?! Me neither. This is it. Let's get out there and win."</p>

<p>Mario nodded along, biding time. "How'd you sneak in? There hasn't been a single natural security alert."</p>

<p>Bowser tested out his powerful and impressive 200+ mph swings in the air, the purr heard even across the room where Mario sorted his equipment. "Super early. That's how."</p>

<p>Mario almost retrieved his signature racket, frozen by a strange thought. Devious even. The sort he'd dismiss if it wasn't aligned with Luigi's idea in principle. Thousands of people might see him play with Bowser, but so what? They'd been put together on teams before and the world kept spinning. What if-</p>

<p>Mario zipped it back, rouging. "Hey, got a spare racket? I.. forgot mine 'cause of you!"</p>

<p>Bowser whipped his way, visibly buffeted. "Come on. That's weak."</p>

<p>"I'm serious!" Mario threw his weight around, believably enough he hoped. "I sleep terribly in general because of you calling me at crazy times of day to go hang out somewhere kingdoms away!"</p>

<p>"Because you are the weirdo who asks for a peace pact and then avoids me in public like I'm the freaking Koopapox! I might as well kidnap Peach again! Everything thing was less complicated then!"</p>

<p>Mario punched his shoulder. "Don't. Do. That."</p>

<p>"Come on!" he whined. "It's all a larp anyway."</p>

<p>"Not to 99 percent of the folks out there. Trust me. Can I use yours or not?"</p>

<p>"Sure," he grunt, looking elsewhere.</p>

<p>Mario stretched a hand out, promptly snatched by the Koopa King.</p>

<p>"Psyche, Mustache!"</p>

<p>Mario's boots dangled above the ground as Bowser raised him high; the tables turning on him harder than they did on Daisy's Cruiser. Despite this, his heart was beating in a good way for once, particularly when the Koopa King leaned in, and said low and dangerously, breath tickling his ear-</p>

<p>"But if you were to fight me for it I MIGHT change my mind."</p>

<p>Before the plumber could sock him in the face for making him blush so much, some sudden outdoors light bled in. Blinded, Bowser sent Mario to the concrete flooring.</p>

<p>"Yo! Heads up." Toad poked his head inside the room. "I was super late and Mario was only like thirty seconds ahead of me so if we take into account the Isle Delfino time zone that judge over there is using and how the dicey rep out there is making them wanna get this going sooner-"</p>

<p>Mario climbed up. "Toad, get to the point!"</p>

<p>"...GG guys!"</p>

<p>Toad got out of dodge as Bowser flung a spare racket at him. It bashed against the wall and Mario supposed that was his spare, green, with an older style logo and a different flex than he was used to. He didn't hate it though, and Bowser didn't react to him scooping it up, so with the Mushroom Anthem started, this was what they were rolling with.</p>

<p>Bowser paused halfway out, glaring. "You owe me that fight."</p>

<p>"Even if we win?"</p>

<p>"Duh. We ain't losing." He winked. "...What ya smilin' for?"</p><hr />

<p>Toad crossed the field to return to his team's locker room. The flower princess was still planted on the benches, jabbing at a touchscreen with hints of frustration. Princess Daisy wore an orange tank-top and shorts and her hair was tied back with a hair band, so she looked ready to go. That couldn't be the issue then, Toad reasoned as he dropped his intel.</p>

<p>"You're right, they're going for a wacky strat of not having one. Man, we shoulda tried that."</p>

<p>"Huh? Oh, yeah. That formation thing I sent's gotta beat that," she droned.</p>

<p>"The one you flubbed up, homegirl? The pdf was upside down and inverted."</p>

<p>As she abruptly lifted, he got a glimpse of her wide pretty blue eyes, if unfortunately living up to her street name. "Fo real? And flipping the phone doesn't help?"</p>

<p>"No, the accelerometer will keep compensating."</p>

<p>She uncrossed her legs, groaning, "That's what I get for finding Adobe in Nairobi and not translating the manual."</p>

<p>Toad inched closer. "Forget this stuff. I just wanna know if everything's alright."</p>

<p>Daisy dropped the phone in her messenger bag, staring at the poorly drained floor. "It's eco-political stuff from back home, dawg. Know all the treasure and excavators and junk back home?"</p>

<p>"Sorta?"</p>

<p>She hesitated. Toad was chill, because if not Luigi wouldn't be his bud, and these rumors of what she was up to since ignoring most of Mario's Facebook schedule events were getting annoying, even for someone like her who avoided the mainstream sites and stuck with the NEETs on digibutter.nerr. "So.. there's these artifacts, right and..." She explained.</p>

<p>"I get it," he fist-bumped at the conclusion, keeping a straight face otherwise. "A guy I'm.. familiar with, The Captain deals with.. Nevermind. Let's go over that more later."</p>

<p>Daisy rose, gathering her gear tepidly. "So I don't sound nuts? I almost told Peachy once. Figured she might know about old stuff-"</p>

<p>"Thank Eldstar you didn't," he sighed.</p>

<p>"Huh-" She was interrupted by the loud reverberation of the anthem, ceiling bits falling overhead.</p>

<p>"GG!" The toad ran out.</p>

<p>Daisy threw her items into a locker and retrieved her racket, orange with her royal flower emblem in the middle. Spilling out onto the field kickstarted her for sure. The right side of the stadium had lots of toads, bob-omb buddies, nokis, piantas, and other friendly species. On the left were more of the same with 'enemy' species, bandits, thwomps, and other folks likely to root for Bowser sprinkled in. Fans were cheering in the stands and promotional agents were on the prowl. One haunted the tanned princess down, a dark boo in a baseball cap. So that made sense… He gifted her a paper bag with a soda in it, Fungus Up.</p>

<p>When Toad stopped lapping up all that attention and saw his partner chugging that, he felt a little sick. Having a soda machine in the castle is how he learned quickly that he hated carbonation. Regardless he reached out to the promoter he'd successfully evaded to get one for solidarity, holding his nose to sip the beverage. He didn't see Mario or Bowser getting handouts over there, so early score for them.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen...and Bowser!" Lakitu and Bowser exchanged nasty looks. "In this doubles match we have Mario Mario and, er, his arch rival King Bowser Koopa versus Princess Daisy Bloom and Mr. Toad K. Toad!"</p>

<p>The crowds cheered, working into a frenzy. All tennis players were in position. Toad and Bowser hugged the net and Daisy and Mario stood farther back. Both Toad and Daisy had developed a twitch from an unknown source, foaming at the mouth. A little extreme much, Mario thought, this early in the-</p>

<p>Thwack!</p>

<p>Mario wavered from the gut punch. Blinking, it was the green ball, bouncing off to the sidelines, a low murmur of laughter from a few accompanying it.</p>

<p>"I don't care how bad you sleep now, plumber boy! Freaking wake up!" Bowser growled.</p>

<p>"For the LAST time, first serve Mario!" Lakitu shot with a cannon another ball out there.</p>

<p>Mario could have sworn it was never said a first time.</p>

	<p><strong>Get ready to rumble!</strong></p>
	
	<p>Luigi settled in the nosebleed section, where he could stretch his arms and legs and the bright green court blow resembled the foosball table they had, now irretrievable under other possessions. Up close where it was packed, must have felt like being tumbled around in a Washing Machine Thing, the replicas that ran rough.</p>

<p>A wave started in the audience as he snapped his first wide-lens pictures. There was a faint 'whoosh' behind him, followed by a cold breeze. He dropped his camera and whipped his head to the side.</p>

<p>"S-sorry!" said the milquetoast form, a little boo diddly.</p>

<p>Luigi quickly calmed his palpitations in the face of Boo Diddley. "Hey Buddy. How have you been?"</p>

<p>"Great. I thought you would be down there playing, though.."</p>

<p>"I was until-" He was drowned out by the Mushroom Anthem blasting. He guessed he'd have to explain himself later. The ennui of the Peace Pact combined with the hindsight realization that Boo might have interpreted that number swap the wrong way at the conclusion of a Mario Party, meant he ghosted the other half of the Scare Pair, and he hated to look like 'that' kind of hero.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's starting!" Boo squinted down. "And B-bowser is here!"</p>

<p>Luigi's attention drifted to the players getting into position, nodding. In his viewfinder, he noticed Mario had a Bowser racket. He impetuously lowered the camera. "-Boo, I have my angles up here and I need to get closer."</p>

<p>"Are some of those Bowser minions?"</p>

<p>"Sure looks like it," he replied with some irritation.</p><hr />

<p>With the triumphant conclusion of the anthem, the game was on. Mario's reservations ebbed away the more he was out there, basking in the limelight. Thousands were now witness to him partnering with Bowser, so invidiously- And he wished there were more.</p>

<p>He served a topspin towards Toad, who returned it with no trouble. Bowser intercepted at the net and sliced hard in Daisy's direction. The ball bounced beyond her until she did a backflip into its path and connected. The ball was but a green blur slipping in the gap between Mario and Bowser.</p>

<p>"Love-15." Lakitu announced.</p>

<p>Mario served towards Toad again, who curved the ball around Bowser at the net. Mario rushed behind the king to counter. Daisy however met him and lobbed the ball over. Bowser made a mad dash to center. He smacked the ball backhanded and failed so spectacularly, someone in row F got a free souvenir.</p>

<p>"Out. Love-30!"</p>

<p>The audience thundered, and the lightning came in the form of camera flashes twinkling. Okay, maybe Mario didn't want this performance filmed for the entire world. They weren't communicating. The plumber was screaming at him and Bowser back, but meaningless words meant nothing and they tripped and tumbled over each other anyway. Toad and Daisy were in sync and their secret was simple. They shut up and sliced.</p>

<p>"Bowser!" he half whispered. "Keep your tail up there, stop stomping my boots, and let me clean up. And stop making my ears ring."</p>

<p>He grunted in acknowledgment, or close enough.</p>

<p>Mario hit lightly towards Daisy, who had no issues on the return. He aimed middle-ish then to test them. It was Toad who sprung ahead that time. This resulted in several volleys between him and Bowser close to the net. That was a start, stifling the hemorrhage. Mario paced from side to side until Daisy countered with the meanest topspin he'd ever seen, red flames from the ball as it bounced out of his reach by a hair.</p>

<p>"Game point!"</p>

<p>'Team Daisoad', at least according to the poster boards held by some, secured the win. Head hanging low, Mario dragged his feet over for the next set. Bowser lumbered over eventually, inclined to snap his racket or Lakitu in half...</p>

<p>On the defensive side, dealing with return volleys was ugly, but less of a disaster. Bowser was exerting himself extra to keep up with the speed and technique rivals. The Koopa King was drenched in sweat by now, soaking through his clothes, sticking to his scales, large muscles and broad chest. His accessories had gotten flung off ages ago, so that with every clumsy but earnest lunge for the ball, his scarlet hair flicked around. It seemed like something he'd do for Peach, but she wasn't in the other umpire chair, so the 'show' WAS to distract him. Though Luigi might have been on to something, as a big brother it was officially against the law of siblings to acknowledge that. Mario would just have to pretend he didn't see it, to Luigi and the people that would flood onto the court and open fire:</p>

<p>
  <em>'How bad was it to work with Bowser? He did force you right? He won't return, won't he? What about all these Bowser Freaks?' The latter was tragically spat by some Mushroomites that looked identical to such 'freaks'. Lastly, Peach would rip the mask off, silent on her views of her ex-abductor since the pact, and the sly, calculated quips would make him shiver.</em>
</p>

<p>-Literally, ice cold Yoshi-Ade spilling over Mario spontaneously.</p>

<p>"Momma mia!" He spun into a group of his fans, a bob-omb buddy, a blue birdo, and Koopa, collectively holding the huge cooler.</p>

<p>"We wanted to celebrate.. even though you lost," one squeaked.</p>

<p>"No, we didn't! GHAAAAAA! I'VE HAD IT WITH THESE LOSERS!"</p>

<p>Mario's attention snapped towards the net as Bowser used a Power Shot. The ball transformed into a speeding bullet bill. Daisy exchanged her game face for shock before lounging, sliding belly first to the white line, and reflecting the flaming projectile over the net. The ball launched out of the stadium like a rocket.</p>

<p>Bowser followed the tiny dot on the court. "I got it! I got it!"</p>

<p>Mario shook himself out of it, the shadow rolling over him. "No, I got it!"</p>

<p>"Move!" Bowser pushed him aside. "You'll screw it up!"</p>

<p>Mario shoved back. "I said I had it!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on the opponent's court, the post-victory jamboree began early. First dismissed as a deranged fan, Toad was the source of those strange noises, gibberish, while Daisy did an impromptu handstand. The toad's vocabulary diminishing was rather heartbreaking. He was way older than he looked and lettered all decrees back in the day. Or that was made up. Daisy was known for hitting the gym, but that spinning top move was more of a break dance- and from that double date thing they did on her cruiser he knew she had two left feet.</p>

<p>"-Wait a minute," he gasped.</p>

<p>The ball fell in between Mario and Bowser with a 'thunk'. Their swings clashed their rackets, knocking them out of their grasp and into the box stands. Breaths were held as the ball made a final additional sad little bounce.</p>

<p>"Game, Daisy and Toad," Lakitu announced. He ducked as cabbages and rotten mushrooms soared over his head. The audience that wasn't attacking him roared at the state of the winning team, sprawled out on the astroturf.</p>

<p>Peach broke into a sprint onto the field. "Call the medics!"</p>

<p>"Good. I quit." Lakitu flew away as staff scurried on the field. Some attended to Daisy after she collapsed while others attempted to stabilize Toad.</p>

<p>"We need space people!" sputtered one magikoopa nurse checking Daisy's pulse.</p>

<p>"Could have used a pause after 'space'," remarked his Kong assistant. Just then, they spotted whom they thought was Tatanga the Space Alien in the crowds, so they began to pack up and evacuate Toad and Daisy out of the tennis court.</p>

<p>Bowser stomped after some of the smock-wearing shy guys and others. "Where do you think you're going? This is cheatin!"</p>

<p>Mario pinched the back of his shirt. "None of this is in the script, trust me. Leave them alone."</p>

<p>He sharply faced Mario, smoke pouring from his nostrils. "Whatever." He leaned against the stone wall of the arched tunnel. "We woulda made a friggin comeback! We woulda! ...Where's my extra green racket?"</p>

<p>Mario shrugged, mind elsewhere. After all, feigning an emergency was overly radical, assuming Toad and Daisy were even trying to punk Bowser like Luigi was somewhere in the sea of attendees. "Probably somebody's consolation prize."</p>

<p>He punched the bricks, reducing them into dust under his knuckles.</p>

<p>Mario inched backward, pale. "..Or I could look for it maybe."</p>

<p>Bowser shook his head. "Just worry about my duffle bag so I can get my clown car keys and leave before these folks grab their pitchforks!"</p>

<p>Mario flushed. It was so obvious Bowser had nothing to do with this catastrophe. Wasn't it?</p><hr />

<p>In row C, Luigi caught Mario and Bowser losing the first set spectacularly. The crowd's gesticulations bopped him around, but that was alright. Toad and Daisy were 'on fleek' as Boo's generation might say. The Sarasaland princess had toned up since he helped her install that equipment in the rec room of her cruise liner. He could never forget. An hour later, the vessel hit a surge and a few tables almost crushed him. Great times.. Anyway, her manic partner Toad was even more excitable. He zoomed in. -Wow! He'd have to share some of these shots with him and have a laugh later. Bowser was a tryhard, but his photos were decent. Mario on the other hand was stiff, thinking too much about what Bowser was doing and not the game. Also good thing he didn't say that out loud. Someone might get the wrong-</p>

<p>"What's going on?" Luigi abruptly rose as the game suspended. Medics were entering the scene.</p>

<p>"Umm. We'd better get out of here!"</p>

<p>Luigi packed his camera away as Boo trembled. "If we get through the pileups at the exits."</p>

<p>"Then.. can I t-try this?" Boo grabbed his right hand, the green plumber yelping he was plunged into darkness while falling.</p>

<p>A second later, his feet were securely on the ground again and colors burnt his eyes. Outside the stadium, he knew he'd been phased through the thick walls. It wasn't the first time, not even with Boo Diddley, though he couldn't help but note that they'd improved the warp speed since that other attempt on the appropriately named Bowser's Nightmare board.</p>

<p>"Thanks, Buddy." Luigi checked a text. "And just in time. Mario wants me to rush ahead of him to the hospital. Sorry it's a goodbye so soon, but we can talk on the way to the lot."</p>

<p>".. It's serious?" Boo trailed him. "My cousin's uncle's cousin's barber might know something about this."</p>

<p>"About what matter, Boo?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. That's what they would know. About things no one else knows."</p>

<p>Luigi sorted through his keys, intrigued. A professor close to him knew the deepest lore like that, then he flew too close to the sun as some propagated. The real story was for another day.. "-Where are you staying now?"</p>

<p>"A Forever Forest cabin. I inherited it from mom.. Oh no she's not 'dead' dead, just staying with relatives in Gloomy Gulch. Since I was out of school she wanted me to.. or made me keep the family hoard up. ..We have a problem with accumulation."</p>

<p>"That can happen to anyone." Luigi smiled wryly, helmet in hand. This hanging out thing was turning out to do wonders for his nerves. "Ever rode a bike?"</p><hr />

<p>Mario waded through the dense crowd, slipped into the locker room, and returned to the open with Bowser's army tan duffle bag. He just caught sight of Peach boarding a medical helicopter as the barriers to the court continued to erode. Security, or the closest equivalent Toad Town had, so the buriest piantas and wigglers, started to hound on the Bowser supporters and adjacent in the crowd.</p>

<p>"Mario!" Someone caught up with him, panting. "I convinced the bus to wait for us. Come on," urged his dinosaur friend, studying his confused expression. "Or did you make other arrangements?"</p>

<p>Mario felt he had to follow him for then. After boarding the Mushroom Bus, it swung around the block and deviated from its route. The red plumber stared out the windows, trying to make sense of where they were when he noticed he was being watched in the reflection. He faced Yoshi, protectively holding the bag closer. While not stamped 'Property of Bowser', it smelted like his cologne, a half-empty bottle swishing around in there somewhere.</p>

<p>"Was anything peculiar about Bowser?"</p>

<p>"Ehh, no-"</p>

<p>"-Was the substitution anticipated?"</p>

<p>"Yosh. There's no way."</p>

<p>The dino sat the home décor magazine on his lap. "I'm not being superfluous, only gathering evidence."</p>

<p>Mario leaned back. "No it wasn't supposed to happen, but I knew ahead of t-IME!"</p>

<p>A pothole bounced him and the rest of the passengers bounced off their seats like they were on a Pinna Park coaster. The Mushroom Bus was taking all of the narrow shortcuts at high speeds. Yoshi didn't notice that he was missing a shoe and the magazine was upside down, on the phone with his 'darlin' again. Looks like Mario dodged that blue shell for then. He agreed to pester Bowser with his friends, but they took it too seriously. His 'dastardly' job as of six months BEFORE the pact was signed was merely being a full-time dad-</p>

<p>"MK East: next stop," a R.O.B. voice droned.</p>

<p>On the Eastern side of Toad Town, the hospital was impossible to miss, a three-story structure made of the brightest whitest bricks and with the tallest mushroom flag pole off of castle grounds. Mario and Yoshi pressed their way into the bustling waiting room, surfing the crowd until they found the reception office. Head nurse 'Nass Toad', a feminine orange-capped toad didn't have a single dark hair, and her purple designer prescription glasses had slid down her face nearly, ignored as she faced a glowing computer screen.</p>

<p>"Excuse me. Hi, it's me Mario. Are Toad and Daisy alright?"</p>

<p>Her thin eyebrows lowered, clicking around with a mouse. "-Please wait until we call you."</p>

<p>Mario and Yoshi backed off as they noticed a bike parking close outside. There was no luck involved, lots were always mostly vacant regardless of how busy the location was, as locals preferred walking, buses, or flying with a power-up. Maybe publicizing Mario Kart races had a deleterious effect he hadn't thought about.</p>

<p>Luigi and a guest gawked at the madness to no surprise to Mario, waving them over to a quieter hallway with the tourist stand.</p>

<p>"I don't know what's crazier, this place or you beating us here."</p>

<p>Yoshi lowered the phone. "They say the bus system is evolving more every day."</p>

<p>So that explains the one Luigi saw flying off of that ramp along the way. "Nevermind. Everyone, I brought a pal that can help us out." He stepped aside, though they barely saw Boo regardless in their partially translucent state.</p>

<p>"Hi.. It's.. Boo E. Diddley."</p>

<p>Mario offered a hand. "Hey, I'm- never mind you know who I am. Didn't we invite this guy to a party or two?"</p>

<p>"-Umm," the boo spoke up.</p>

<p>"-Girl?.. I should stop, shouldn't I?"</p>

<p>Yoshi shrugged at him, the plumber elbowing him back. As the stickler for honorifics, the dinosaur would hit that mine too if he wasn't ensnared with that dang phone.</p>

<p>"-Ah hem. Well, we've hit a roadblock. It's too early."</p>

<p>"I'm pleased to be acquainted or reacquainted with you, Boo." Yoshi sniffed the air. "Let's wait in the cafeteria!"</p>

<p>Luigi took the new friend's arm. "Us somewhere else. Not hungry."</p><hr />

<p>"I was sorta hungry."</p>

<p>"Oh really? Sorry about that." He turned to the boo with him in the grass lot. Flipping through the contents of his camera's memory card hadn't revealed anything like he was desperately hoping. "It was a quick excuse and I wasn't ready for them to see the camera. I just picked the hobby up and the instant people notice, I'm going to be pigeonholed as his action photographer or something."</p>

<p>"I understand. A cousin moved downtown to work in an office now, also trying to do his own thing without relatives 'buggin' as he, umm, said, plus some bad words.. So when did you pick it up?"</p>

<p>"Shh!.. Just kidding. There was a cool thread on the messages boards where... " They shared a laugh as for a brief moment, away from the hospital's double doors, continually swiveling opening to devour more occupied cots, things seemed alright. "Want a photo?"</p>

<p>Boo's continence darkened. "I wouldn't show up in it, and not for the reason you'd think. I'm alive."</p>

<p>Luigi blinked at them. "Of course."</p>

<p>"No like. Really. It's like a family curse."</p>

<p>"-To.. be among the living?"</p>

<p>They nodded. "It's backward and I think the person that did it to the Diddleys was new on the job, but it's true...So.. did I share too much?"</p>

<p>Luigi stood up, patting their back. "Not at all. Thanks for reminding me of something too."</p>

<p>Every angle of the match had to have been captured by someone out there. Why not stalk the Mushroom Press in the heart of the city, a maligned at times but necessary corporation where all intelligence -or gossip seekers congregated?</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>"I know, it's bonkers for me to believe too, but Steve called us off from covering the game and we listened to the fella. What was I thinking? At least we have some folks with brains, like you!"</p>

<p>Kylie Koopa, a famous local reporter, folded her arms outside her cubicle. These gray panels partitioned the open office space of the press, creating rooms of varying sizes. As the author of the Koopa Kronicles, a newspaper detailing events through an 'allied enemy species' (Luigi despised that oxymoron. Just call 'em citizens, darn it) lense, she had a big one, all sorts of future and present stories tacked up.</p>

<p>Luigi humbly unhooked his lanyard, opened up the camera, and passed over the SD card. "Some are blurry."</p>

<p>"Anythang helps, brother." Excitedly, she pulled him into her space, lowering her tone. "Remember that landmark case..." she rambled on as he plopped in her spinny chair and rolled backward to her laptop, "..And the perp is still rotting in a cell off of that toad kid's Gameboy Camera evidence. Anywho.."</p>

<p>When she blew up the images on screen, Luigi felt light-headed. Toad and Daisy captured mid-quiver, the audience's faces distorted in agony, the medic's desperation in the stills.. What if the hospital was filled because they weren't the only ones? He clutched the cap he'd removed as he'd stepped in.</p>

<p>"Earth to Weegee fella?.. Yeah I agree, doesn't look like heat stroke. I should ask that 'ol Mitch."</p>

<p>"~That's the name. Don't wear it out!" that person said from elsewhere.</p>

<p>She cryptically sighed.</p>

<p>Mouth dry, Luigi swiveled to the cubicle across from them. The green toad with the thick black eyebrows was suited, contrasting Kylie's causal lazy shell and green porter hat look, leaning back leisurely in his mesh chair. Everything he was working on was locked up in cabinets, at least ostensibly, and the plate on his cleared desk was solid gold. Stamped was 'Mitch' as Luigi had just heard, though he knew him as 'Weegee.' Indeed. That other Weegee.</p>

<p>"Don't waste that guy's time," Mitch continued in a deep, striking voice. "I'll handle this scoop."</p>

<p>"Never!" Kylie slung a pink eraser over there, other reporters and journalists eyeing the pair exasperatedly. A shouting match ensued, Kylie got a few people to back her up when in truth, no one hadn't anything solid to work with, and Luigi dipped out, not exactly sorry Peach's old heckler was getting dogpiled. He never thought he'd see Mitch again.</p>

<p>~On bike, the young toad tossed newsletters packed with acrid rumors. Once he took a 'plumber whack' like a champ- and those hurt especially when Mario delivered them, and he never capitulated. They'd rescue the princess and arrive home to find citizens in a pit of disgust and confusion over strange notions: There was another 'Jumpman' out there somewhere. SMB3 was actually a stage play. Larry Koopa was named after some talk show host. Actually that last one wasn't that bad. Either way, he packed his stories into The Kingdom Enquirer, and to give Mario and co a mild victory, he decided that targeting celebrities and influencers paid more.</p>

<p>What disturbed Luigi most about 'Weegee' wasn't the vindictiveness, it was his clouded, grayish black eyes, hiding macabre secrets. After all, he was 'Weegee' because he seldom lied.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Boo sipped water from a dispenser. On the corkboard nearby were artlces, some awards, and a post-it note. Signed by Mario, it had his number and Peach's Castle, to contact him if the other failed. Boo couldn't fathom being that open, their contacts list a single screen long. Unable to put it off any longer, after all Luigi was counting on them to be useful, they approached who they thought was their cousin new in town. The dark boo wore a blonde stringy wig, definitely not his flattering with his skin tone, but what did Boo know about that.</p>

<p>"Hi. A-are you-"</p>

<p>"What the-!?" The dark boo flipped their keyboard in the air. His office space was recently assigned and mostly empty short of a photo and some bougie chrome and gold-plated office supplies. "Piss off, bro. I'm trying to not let anybody know I'm a loser Diddley," drawled 'Susie Que' judging by the name tag.</p>

<p>Boo shrunk back, trembling. "S-sorry, I um- I um.." This wasn't the cousin they assumed it was. It was that other cousin. No, not that one. That other other one!</p>

<p>Boo scrambled for the exit, sending cubicle walls falling like dominos.</p>

<p>Luigi tore himself from Kylie's civil war, catching the front door before it clacked against the stopper. Everything was crashing back there as he took to the streets. He'd have to send a check later.</p><hr />

<p>Inches away from a layout map, blocking his studies on purpose, Mario tapped a spot. "I found the room."</p>

<p>"...Excuse me. What room?"</p>

<p>"444, what all the nurses were talking about as they passed by!"</p>

<p>"-I know, darling. This disaster has that pernicious bastard's prints all over- What was that again, Mario?" Yoshi admitted, lowering the phone.</p>

<p>He wrapped his arm around the dinosaur, easing him away from the light blue walls of the west wing to the pale green of the east. Codes blared over the intercom and a constant flow of patients being wheeled around forced them to hug the sides. "You and her?... Just move here already."</p>

<p>Yoshi quickly covered the speaker. "Old pal, traveling here is no burden when Bowser is up to his old tricks again."</p>

<p>"About that-"</p>

<p>"No need to extrapolate. We all know it only takes one minion scum to usurp a hotel-sized facility, as in that game of yours that nominal fans like to pretend isn't 'in continuity' or some drivel. My darling and I are working on this case together."</p>

<p>Mario leaned in, swearing he heard Birdo going 'For the love of God, hang up already!' while a soap was on in the background. Either way, a lot less ambiguously, she begged to be let go to process this wild morning after Yoshi's thumb slipped from the speaker holes.</p>

<p>"No problem, daring." Yoshi hung up, just as they were at 444.</p>

<p>Mario pressed against the adjacent wall, scoping everything out. "Couldya some of those unlimited minutes to see where Weeg is at? Ah, nevermind-"</p>

<p>"I'm here!" Luigi rushed up, heavily winded, a frayed edges on his clothes. "I'll explain later. Get in before the crowds do! Everyone's suspecting Bowser!"</p>

<p>Mario kicked 444 open. Deathly cold air hit them as their attentions snapped to Toad and Daisy in two beds, blankets up to their necks. As if tangled in a web, IVs strung from them to machines to them again to other machines, displaying fluctuating data.</p>

<p>"Azul, I've had it up to here with!-" The doctor noticed Mario and co and staggered away from Daisy's bed, straightening up. "Hello, I am Doctor Professor Koopa. If you received visitation privileges, I'm afraid that was preemptive."</p>

<p>His unflinching walk cut them off a quarter of the way in. Mario considered his options carefully and teased raising the white flag at least.</p>

<p>"..Oh, whoops! Sorry doc. We'll let you do your thing."</p>

<p>"Perfect," the doctor replied, thin fingers curling around the dimmer. "Give us half an hour. Alright? Alright." The door shut in their faces.</p>

<p>"What do you make of that?" Luigi asked quietly.</p>

<p>Mario checked his watch. "I'll know after we chat with the head honcho 'round here."</p>

<p>Outside were tables for luncheons and where fundraisers or other activities may occur. They were drawn towards a blue tent furthest back, a 'Make A Wish On A Star Foundation' booth where Princess Peach was seated and pithily conversing with an old 'friend'. In some other timeline, that other guy would be donating at that booth. In this crappier one, he was simply about to make things difficult.</p>

<p>"I'll take that, Mushtache. Sheesh."</p>

<p>Bowser pulled the duffle bag off the plumber so roughly, he fell on the pavement.</p>

<p>"I suggest you get back before someone sees you!" Peach hissed.</p>

<p>"How'd he get here and dodge the pillory at the same time?" Luigi demanded.</p>

<p>"He bullied his way onto one of the last helicopters from the stadium, justifying it due to 'Mario stranding him'."</p>

<p>"Nice fan-fiction, Bowsy." Yoshi eye rolled. "Princess, your hospital is out of control. Look at what they did our boy!" He grabbed Luigi, showing off the footprints on him. He hated to be some pitying example, what he always was before he saved all of his friends twice, but the stampede from the chockablock entrance areas was real, and he coughed up a shoelace on the way here..</p>

<p>"I am aware, but Dr. Professor Koopa is trustworthy," the princess tried to convince them. "When I was young, he practiced at my castle."</p>

<p>"Aaand mine!" Bowser butt in. "I remember that wacko. Part of my outsourcing mad scientists program for a while."</p>

<p>Mario rose. "Bowser, don't go there."</p>

<p>"-Instead, go home!" Luigi pointed out to the street.</p>

<p>"Our tennis rivals are here! Unconscious yeah but I legally gotta hand this over-" He unrolled a yellowed scroll, the official Darklandian decree of defeat. "We DID win after all. Lakitu admitted it. Team Bowsario!"</p>

<p>"They're busting out the portmanteus now.." Luigi cringed.</p>

<p>"Huh? All I know is folks were holding signs with it at the game. Anyway, I belong on this investigation don't cha think?!"</p>

<p>"I think we should trounce you right here!" Yoshi snatched his shirt. Luigi was a bit taken aback but began to roll up his sleeves. Peach drew back, partially covering her face with a brochure, though her eyes couldn't hide that she wouldn't mind some brutality.</p>

<p>Mario's teeth clenched. Toad and Daisy and others were in peril, and yet poor, boisterous, braggadocious, but blameless Bowser was all they focused on, harpooned for nebulous crimes like a prized killer whale the size of the Toadtanic. This was it. He had to shock em, just a bit, the most distal and candid part of him longing for <em>reprisal</em>.</p>

<p>Mario appealed with calculated sweetness, "We are a fair kingdom, so Bowser should be informed as a <em>legal</em> participant."</p>

<p>There was weighty silence before Peach requested the scroll. Able to read Darklandian, Luigi knew exactly why she turned as pink as her signature dress.</p>

<p>"Stars... It's.. well the diction is terrible, but the big koopa ain't wrong!"</p><hr />

<p>The dizziness, vertigo, the lack of oxygen.. Boo still hadn't gotten used to shoe panic attacks like some online article promised they would. Sue was so terrible, the reasons why were blotted from their mind, making them appear like a lunatic in the streets when Luigi tracked them down. It was a great thing he was the best plumber hero ever, with trying to pry and leaving there in the emptied food court to calm down. As staff poured in later, the boo had to vacate the premises without a plan, ending up in the middle of a bunch of crossroads into the cardiovascular center, psychiatric services, and business offices.</p>

<p>"Ugh.. shake outta it.."</p>

<p>Hearing squeaks of shoes, they ducked into an alcove without thinking.</p>

<p>"Yes sixty at this point. Why?.." a person chatted away, marking on a clipboard as he walked. "Facetious sounding or not, you don't need to worry about - Hold on, we have a code blue on floor three. If he calls back, send it to Nass' extension."</p>

<p>"Yes sir. I won't leave here. Even for lunch..."</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>The doctor left the blue shy guy nurse at an office, while the subordinate unloaded items from a cart. A minute later. "Lunch break!"</p>

<p>And the kid left!</p>

<p>Boo peeped out, the coast clear. The light flickered above the medical cart, some packaged things on top and boxes on the second rack. Suddenly 'Ashley's Theme' played from a brick phone tucked within those articles. No one told them that the empty parts of hospitals were so creepy. Boo froze on the spot, as if one more move would vaporize them.</p>

<p>"It's me from Isle Falsa Hospital again.." Beeps and blips of a computer game was in the background along with some clacking of a typewriter. "Is this voicemail? You think you can dip on me?! Don't get cute bro, or you'll be found in a puddle of your own blood soon!"</p>

<p>Shrieking, Boo fled from 'Sue' all over again.</p>

	<p>Kylie Koopa circled in red ink the stadium her personal Toad Town map, allowing her to dodge the ire of coworkers during parties and best yet, confidential. She slipped her shoes on from under the desk and grabbed her purse, ready to pretend to run to Tayce T's. In Luigi's photos, the sun's glare was creating numerous lustrous green objects in the audience, and spotting the same in Susie's snaps- indeed someone other than Luigi had the smarts to record the game, she just had to drop in now. They might have been flagrantly goofing around on the other side of the office right then, but when it got down to it, they were a bit of a prodigy, or maybe being a boo gave them an edge, getting so close in some photos that she could tell Mr. Toad's fly was almost open.</p>

<p>She froze one foot out the door, a small buzzing sensation in the back of her neck, a psionic beckoning.</p>

<p>"Watch your back, babe."</p>

<p>She forcibly swiveled Mitch's chair around, too annoyed to notice that his cubicle was now a hot mess with projects. "You of all people know this ain't my first rodeo. Hear?"</p>

<p>"No no no.." He slipped a pen into a shirt pocket. "It's whatever as far as this scoop goes. Watch your back round Susie. Hear?" he echoed playfully.</p>

<p>She stepped away, flippantly. He was such an envious tool and always had since they were little. "Buzz off fella. Stay outta my noggin too, there's enough goin' on in there."</p>

<p>After Kylie departed, Mitch did the usual, made appointments, sent a few docs to editors, and flirted with the receptionist until the lunch bell went off. Steve the Bullet Bill, head over the press rocketed his way out and others followed. After the flux, their latest dark boo employee was missing.</p><hr />

<p>Across the globe, on Sirena Beach, tourists dotted the golden shore, lounging in chairs or under umbrellas to soak up the last of the daylight hours. Others lined up for the ferry to Pinna Park to join the after-dark parties. The blue noki that crossed by on the stone path to Hotel Delfino might as well have been invisible. The most average tourist imaginable, he wore a red loose-fitting Hawaiian shirt and dark sunglasses. The moodily lit lobby was thus like a blackout basement, the tiki lights on their 'eco' setting. Despite that, he behaved as if they were bolted to his head, navigating carefully to the bemused clerk. Soon his documents were stamped, he signed a slip with his non-dominant hand on purpose, and he was on his way.</p>

<p>"Enjoy your stay, brah."</p>

<p>"Merci." The guest climbed the stairs, wanting to get some cardio in after his monotonous plain ride. The deluxe suite waiting for him had a jacuzzi, a towel folded on the bed in the shape of a cataquack, a pre-stocked fridge, and more.. After the business was involved in a little adventure where an innocent plumber was accused of vandalism, they stacked on many more floors and upped the stars according to Welp. From up high, the view of the shore and the stars above the ocean was fantastic. Drawing away from the balcony, he corrected the slightly crooked watercolor painting of Noki Bay, the only imperfection his critical eye could catch. He'd been building up too much paid time off, so he was kidnapped essentially and tossed on the plane, and in the confusion he'd forgotten to bring the telescope. Among what he brought at least were additional flowery shirts, a wet suit, a wallet with a badge, and a silenced handgun…</p>

<p>"Here safely."</p>

<p>"Glad to hear, Agent 0064," Agent N, called in. "Are you relaxing as I ordered?"</p>

<p>"Of course, mon chéri!" The noki picked a pineapple from the bowl of fresh fruit, avoiding and scooting the sides entirely the big water bottles that were a trap and would cause a hundred coin charge miraculously appear on the bill if he opened one.</p>

<p>"Packed everything?"</p>

<p>"I have most of your ties for some reason."</p>

<p>"Ah! No wonder I had to settle for the bows."</p>

<p>"You are the snazziest at HQ regardless! Next time we're at the mall-"</p>

<p>"Careful, Jelectro," he laughed. "Q2 policy, remember?"</p>

<p>"No personal business on wiretapped lines.." Jelecto droned. That shouldn't apply when they happened to also be roommates, but N was the arbiter of procedures and was trying to keep the base in line before his retirement finally crept up on them. Plus, Jelectro didn't want to return home to find his belongings on the curb.</p>

<p>"So- before I go," N approached, his normally flat tone wavering. "I guess I have no choice but to break the rules myself. While you were in the air some 'Mario game' was happening. My niece was there, and might have happened to her."</p>

<p>Jelecro jumped up. "Jeremy, how?"</p>

<p>"-The news was passed to me a minute ago, so we're on it. Sit tight and try to enjoy it down there. ..And don't overdo it with that chuckola cola stuff! -Over."</p>

<p>The line disconnected abruptly. Excusez-moi, the noki only reduced himself to an inebriated mess once, and after a dastardly Agent M had spiked his drink, and wouldn't do that again, though wandering to the patio again, he did find his inner peace as fleeting as the light on the horizon. He tiptoed downstairs and lowered his shades. The desk guy was off his station, currently fiddling with a broken pachinko machine in the back. When not filtering the world through those dark lenses he saw <em>all</em>. -This included the lifeguards imagining some beachgoers with less clothing, and they really needed to not do that when he was around..</p><hr />

<p>Five people, as a group, at least physically, snuck through the employee back door leading into the kitchen. In the middle of the noon lunch rush, the brigade busily prepared various meals. Peach sprinted to the head chef, a toad with a brown twirly mustache and a tall white hat, though too late to prevent pots, spoons, flour, and eggs from flying. Mario and co braced as it all crashed down.</p>

<p>"Ze Princess has spoken! Ignore Big Koopa!" he said, ignoring the yolk dripping off his head.</p>

<p>Peach spied out of a round window. "I am afraid the issues will continue in the cafeteria," she muttered.</p>

<p>"-Then Bowser and I will hang back until it dies down."</p>

<p>Mario almost flinched from their cynical looks, or Yoshi's at least, like a pent-up and flashing bob-omb. His old pal placed the reins on himself however, and was the first to leave. Luigi was about to wordlessly follow when Mario called him over.</p>

<p>"Hey.. Actually, both of you. Over here." He grabbed the princess and dashed into the closest secure place.</p>

<p>Peach wrapped her arms around herself, shivering. "W-why d-did you p-push us into the f-freezer?"</p>

<p>He turned to his brother. "Weege, you were in the stands, high up I think I saw at a point. What happened from your perspective?"</p>

<p>"Uh.." Luigi's breath fogged the space. "Why now?"</p>

<p>"Because the walls have ears out there."</p>

<p>"It's.. That's the wrong idiom."</p>

<p>"Answer me, bro!"</p>

<p>"I'm inconclusive."</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Er, r-really," he folded. "Again no one knows for sure, but they ARE of course convinced on the message boards that Bowser cheated."</p>

<p>Mario's heavy thoughts were abruptly interrupted by Peach swinging open the frozen door.</p>

<p>"Be Sherlock Mario elsewhere," she begged. "Frozen peaches are not a menu item here!"</p>

<p>They emerged, the warmth from the kitchen burning their faces. Mario reluctantly let them go to approach Bowser, leaning around the cutting station with a bored expression.</p>

<p>"Ah hem. Don't get too comfortable, Koopa. Helping out will make this go quicker, so what size apron will fit around your giant-?"</p>

<p>Bowser lost his footing, making a rack of knives clang. "-What?"</p><hr />

<p>The princess surreptitiously used side passages to cut through the hospital, knowing her passive face wouldn't work under scrutiny. She wouldn't be so naive as to believe just anything from the rumor mill without investigation, so this was hers. Could it be an attack on Mr. Toad and Daisy during peace times? As much as she hated Bowser, it couldn't be true. She would never forgive herself for letting it be so easy. The sterile, brightly lit lobby was quiet now; a patient in a cot had not shot through those double doors for a quarter-hour.</p>

<p>"Could you direct me to Theodore?"</p>

<p>She'd caught Nass, incidentally the second of only three staff she knew by name, stacking up a dense stack of papers. Peach prayed they didn't represent every new patient. "Wait at his office. Do you know where that is?"</p>

<p>"I do, thank you." Peach flashed a self-effacing smile.</p>

<p>The princess power walked where she thought that was, only to end up with egg on her face like that hard-working Chef, lost and going in circles in the constantly expanding west wing 'her' own MK East.</p>

<p>"-Doesn't Theo know I got a bad leg? Screw the weight limit," mumbled a whomp at the end of the hall, suited in a wrinkled white doctor's coat. She just caught him trudging to the elevator.</p>

<p>Peach ignored the cautious voice in the back of her mind and followed him to that 'Theo', using the stairs to the third floor. She had to be proactive here, like she promised the kingdom she would be when she seized control. In the past, being ripped away from her castle and thrown into a dungeon was an obstacle to that, but now there was no excuse. 'Board room #6' drew her attention immediately up there. Out spilled some staff, an elderly toad woman, the whomp from before, a blue shy guy nurse, a first responder, several junior assistants, and lastly Doctor Professor Koopa, tapping a stylus to a pda.</p>

<p>She quickly came up and flattened down her hair. "Dr. Professor? Not to interrupt, but is there a prognosis now?" she asked softly.</p>

<p>He spun to her with a smile. He had the grandfatherly countenance down, and she was eager to listen. "Hello again, Sweet Pea. We are swamped my dear, and as a nonpartisan establishment in imitation of yourself, a few other patients required our urgent attention.."</p>

<p>Peach tried to hide increasing discontent. Outright preferential treatment was certainly not the alley she was going down. Also, swamped? As she'd arrived via the air, she assumed most of that ground traffic were ambulance chasers, as her castle carried a lightning rod for trouble and it springing up elsewhere in Toad Town was unprecedented. A few of the stir crazies might have started the chase and others unaware of the turn of events chased because they were chasing, more of a literal example, along with those aware and concerned over Toad and Daisy. That being said, if they weren't the sickest dogs in the infirmary she could view it as good news for her friends and those fans..</p>

<p>He gently lay a hand on her shoulder, scanning a pda. "Save that long face. I'm not done. Your folks need.. Precisely five minutes until visitation."</p>

<p>"Oh! Thank you, Doctor. I'll tell the others."</p>

<p>"Good girl."</p>

<p>As the princess departed one way, an elevator opened, a toad girl resembling a shorter version of Nass T. bursting out. She collided and collapsed with the koopa doctor.</p>

<p>"Sorry!" She tugged on his arm, popping his joints. "I'm Emery T., rooftop ems. Did I miss the big vote?"</p>

<p>Doctor Professor slapped away the girl's hands. "Your ballot would be useless, Miss Emery. Now Keep your butt out of private matters!"</p>

<p>As he yelled the pipe above rattled, the main water line leading below. Someone on ground level was flushing repeatedly to create a dinosaur-deterring ruckus.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Yoshi tapped on the stall anyway. And they thought they were sneaky with their lack of legs and feet to spot. This wasn't a rookie the boo was dealing with. He had arguably more experience than Mario! "I know you are in there. Luigi is searching everywhere, worried. My darling's worried and she doesn't even know you!"</p>

<p>Giving up, Boo opened the door an inch. "Y-you wouldn't understand."</p>

<p>"Can I try?"</p>

<p>"...T-the game and.. what people are saying on the message boards and.. In one day life just got really strange!"</p>

<p>Yoshi's face said he was carefully searching for something, only to capitulate. "Listen to this wise one."</p>

<p>He held out the phone, and it was squeaking too much to be discernable, then what came through, besides the popping of bubbles, likely those 'soaps' she worked with, was something like her saying, "Listen whoever you are, life is always strange, we're all a little strange, but that's what can it wonderful. From what I understand, our friends are in danger and we'll only get through this together."</p>

<p>Boo crept out more. "I.. get it. But.. my cousin. IF.. I never knew he was here, and now that he knows I know.."</p>

<p>"-Thanks, sweetheart. I'll be back... Boo, if you don't mind, how old are you?" Yoshi took over again, putting Birdo on hold. ".. Twenty-five? I'd gone through a lot by that time, including problematic family. Heroes have to support each other whether there's a physical connection or not, or we'll be flattened like Toad's Turnpike did to that forest of Super Leaf trees... Sheesh," he cringed in reminiscence. "Anyway-"</p>

<p>A plunger-carrying green plumber barreled into the restroom, did a roll and stopped in the center. No whirlpool to be found, dropped it. He guessed that nurse trolled him again. "Since I'm here, are you feeling better Boo?"</p>

<p>"Y-yeah. It was n-nothing. I mean, I didn't want to sound like crazy at first but.. I changed my name to Booigi the Second and wanted to practice saying it out loud... Also the first Booigi name was taken," they clarified nervously.</p>

<p>Still panting, Luigi studied his friend and then Yoshi, unable to read either really. "That's all? Well, we can join Mario now. I didn't want to be pigeonholed as his Boswell either, but I couldn't help but write down the procedure codes they've given our friends."</p>

<p>Yoshi found his voice. "What do they mean?"</p>

<p>"Unsure." Luigi lowered the memo pad. "Except that I ran out of space for them all."</p><hr />

<p>A koopaling yanked off his headphones and shook his blue hair into a mohawk again. Forget lounging on the couch like normal teens liked to do on Saturdays. The misery had followed the fifteen-year-old from school.</p>

<p>The den was where someone wouldn't realize they were in a medieval castle, or a replica of one rather, as Bowser had his homes blown up and crushed frequently and this might have been the five-hundredth edition. Koopa Troop specialized in building quickly while paying so much attention to detail that the squeaky floorboards, phantom drafts, and leaky pipes were in the same spots, not soundproofing, so before he arrived he knew someone was using the wide-screen projection TV . That wasn't unexpected on summer break, only the sight of the 'Wendy Menace' on the shaggy rug, playing the PlayStation.</p>

<p>He launched a pillow at her. "Pause whatever you're downloading. We're out of bandwidth!"</p>

<p>The ocean princess paused on a menu, scowling back. Her makeup got smudged. Or not, he could never tell. Unable to read kanji, her games like the Princess Parlor franchise all blended together too. "I know the ISPs are lame and totally prejudiced because of where we live, but hold on gosh! I have to download my library again."</p>

<p>"Play the one in Iggy's joint or something! You don't own this place!"</p>

<p>She scrunched her nose up. "~GROSS! It was bad enough when I logged in as him by mistake and all of my friends thought I'd gone full weeb from his waifu avatar, form that totes overrated Kame-zoku Bōru Zetto!"</p>

<p>"You sure they weren't on point?" he snarked.</p>

<p>She tossed a spare controller at her brother, which hurt! "Hush. I have privileges to use this TV and you don't. ~Buh-bye!"</p>

<p>Larry groaned, kicking a chess table over on the way out. If only he hadn't been caught by Kamek talking to Mushroomite friends online. He'd have a slot for the good stuff and not be limited to what Lemmy would spare him, like some Nintendo games or junk for babies that he didn't care about. He decided to sit on the moat for a while, lava bubbling below his hanging toes, gaining one extra bar for his laptop signal. While a year old, the hinges were loose. It might have been because the plastics weren't made for Darklandian climates, and it was just plain worn out, his only outlet to have fun. He had a trap song he was working on under his 'Dj L4rry' profile. He could call it: Hell Valley Sky Trees. The phrase appeared in a Mario game once if one knew where to look. Or was it too edgy?</p>

<p>A notification sounded. "Attention! All koopalings meet in 'the room', now!" stated Ludwig's text.</p>

<p>"All heck no.."</p><hr />

<p>After checking for prying eyes, Ludwig reentered the meeting area and seated himself on an upside-down mop bucket. A big sneeze shook the room.</p>

<p>"Non-denominational sentient celestial beings bless you, Morton!" he exclaimed to the wheezing 'little' brother.</p>

<p>For Morton to only be sixteen, he was the size of two sumo bros, his big lungs creating a hurricane of dust. "Did we really-" he sniffled, "Have to coalesce, convene, amalgamate here?"</p>

<p>Ludwig decided to stand after all. In the crampest area in their giant castle were them, Lemmy and Roy, the others disregarding his messages. "Morton, we shall not do the last of those. I hope. Anyway, I had to make ourselves scarce with so many of our minions drifting in and out."</p>

<p>"Yeeah, it sucks." Roy, a very tall and muscular koopaling, leaned on a metal rack, warping it. "All wanted ta see dat dumb tennis thing. Don't see nobody lining up fer MY Koopa Ball games.."</p>

<p>"Maybe don't fumble those slam dunks?" Lemmy continued to twirl the broom handle between his fingers as Roy hauled him over and gave him a noogie.</p>

<p>"Cease this!" Ludwig pulled them apart. "I'd prefer we all partake in that tennis frenzy, understood?"</p>

<p>"Sounds fun, Luddy. Hold on." Lemmy bought out a toy phone with different colored buttons and a pink plastic shell. "I have an app that can cast to our loudspeakers."</p>

<p>"I thought Vater purchased you a real cellular phone?"</p>

<p>The diminutive twenty-two-year-old did a sort of trick and uncovered his hand again, revealing a different one with a giant FHD touch screen, unused and still covered in plastic. "Psych! But seriously, it might work to get them to show up."</p>

<p>"No Lemmy, remember how this is all a 'surprise thingy' as you put it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yeah.."</p>

<p>"And callow as some of us are, there should be no problem taking Airship One for a spin as they say!"</p>

<p>He lifted one moldy curtain, flooding the closet with the reddish light of the outdoor Badlands landscape. The shipyard was directly below.</p>

<p>Roy rose his pink shades. "Airship wut?"</p>

<p>The commander's grand expression dropped as quickly as their last castle went down, pressing his snout against the dirty glass to peer harder. A big flattened spot of soil is where their oldest ship was this morning. Now it was gone, terrorizing the skies somewhere else.</p>

<p>"Ooh ooh! May I ask my editors of the 'Bestest, Most Superior, Most Exquisite Thesaurus Ever' if they can spot it?" Morton hopped in excitement, making the single bulb swing in the room. "If Kammy took the ship on her spending sprees, her flea market rummaging, her marketing massacring, then my expedient, enthusiastic friends-"</p>

<p>"Our business must not be broadcast to out of kingdom partners," Ludwig cried. "Even if they funded, subsidized, or sponsored you!"</p>

<p>It got so silent, they could hear the goomba marching drills three floors up.</p>

<p>"Like why?" Roy asked. "You a secret sports nerd now? Ha.. ha ha ha!" he roared. "And is dis why I saw ya with Iggy's nerd buddies da other day? Ha ha ha!"</p>

<p>Ludwig pressed open the door, blasting everyone with much-needed fresh air. "Let us go with that for now!" he agreed. "If I have to paint one of our tanks as a Mushroom Bus and roll it into town during rush hour, we shall."</p>

<p>"If you really think you can play Tetris with this tetrad.." Lemmy laughed under his breath.</p>

<p>He was the only of the eight that could keep a license and owned a kart, a polka dot B-Dasher to be precise, but it was all in good fun for the jester. While he didn't like terms like general, being Ludwig's had been less stressful lately, and he'd be in even better spirits after today possibly, though he dreaded a bit how the commander would react if he revealed that the Emerald Circus was pleading for Lemmy to join another tour..</p>

<p>Lemmy whipped out his phone. If there was somebody who'd mastered bridging two worlds together recently, it was this person.</p><hr />

<p>Bowser was tired of sucking his stomach in, so he tore the apron off, dropping the shredded fabric before the cook.</p>

<p>"Mon Dieu!" the chef scolded, wagging a rolling pin at him. "Replace that before you deliver ze koopasta."</p>

<p>"Whatever.." With a puff of smoke, he returned to his tasks. idly wondering if that freak from the Awful Towers or Maple Treeway. He'd never invaded either and if he didn't hold back for Mario's sake, he might do something about that..</p>

<p>Lunch proceeded at a breakneck pace. There were extra staff called in to handle the surge and visitors willing to pay for hospital food to avoid vacating the premises. Of course, between Mario and Bowser in the kitchen, the cuisine was editable today. Mario prepared bundle after bundle of fresh pasta. Their eyes would meet for an awkward second, the plumber checking on him or something. Bowser was fantastic at this too, thank you. Didn't he remember from their Camp Ukiki retreat? He made one Mistake, otherwise his Gorgeous Steak was cut on the grain, and the Bone-In-Cut was delectable and juicy, child's play for a grilling king!</p>

<p>"Zat ist it for now!" the Chef declared, hanging up his hat. "Good job on zat last ticket."</p>

<p>"Phew!" Bowser cathartically stabbed the sharp butcher's knife deep into the cutting board.</p>

<p>Mario boldly approached having witnessed that. "We have time to help with the ala carte and buffet. Get over here. Hear me? Let's-a go!"</p>

<p>Bowser's response was to slap him, though moments later he was serving peas anyway. It was easy to drop a scoop on plates through a small window, and as long as no one could recognize him being a goof, it was alright. He guessed. Meanwhile, Mario passed along food to tables like some waiter, where those seated would act all starstruck. It made Bowser want to vomit. No, he wasn't jealous or nothin'. It was incensing that they knew so little about the guy they worshiped. If he asked one of those puny losers what Mario's real name was, they'd tilt their heads going-</p>

<p>"You out of order or what?.. Typical Khalid. Yeah, bootleg or not still mad about the Tamagachi thing," some twenty-something nurse grumbled.</p>

<p>Waking up, Bowser gave the toad girl a giant helping. "There. Get your vitamins in."</p>

<p>Emery T. glanced up from her tray. "OMG, BOWSER?!"</p>

<p>"Me?! No way, chick!" Bowser ducked from the window, only the spikes on his green shell visible.</p>

<p>"Dude, I can't mistake your sprite. I cosplay as you for all the Rebotoc Fests and I'm your biggest fan!"</p>

<p>Bowser slowly leaned up. He'd had desperate koopa girls go through this spell before he let them down easy, no one could ever replace Clawdia, but never a toad. He'd pinch himself, but the replacement apron was doing that enough.</p>

<p>"I get it. Here's proof." Emery raised a gold Bowser brooch necklace. "See? Only you putting your foot down can save this hospital-"</p>

<p>Someone tapped her shoulder. "Excuse me ma'am-"</p>

<p>"Go around me then!" she barked at the panser ambulance driver, one of many being held up. "-But anyway, all we're filling out are prescriptions for a sedative mega-vitamin. You're not Koopra Wenphry, I get it. Great show by the way, but people will listen to you and- and maybe-"</p>

<p>"Whoa! Slow down, gal. You saying that FungusFace and Flower Chick are part of that?"</p>

<p>Emery paused. "..King, duh!"</p>

<p>"Crap.." All the while, Bowser showed himself too much and he was spotted. Angry staff became hysteric, dropping their trays and shrieking for Mario.</p>

<p>Bowser shoved the serving spoon to the nearest cook. "Take this. I left my clown car's lights on!"</p>

<p>"I have no handsssssss!" 'Khalid' the fire snake complained in his wake.</p>

<p>The Koopa King scrambled through the kitchen and stumbled through the back doors. Catching his breath, he grabbed a big stick in case the mob poured out behind him. A shrill ringing, a sound he'd actually been tuning out until then, made him gasp and tumble into a water fountain.</p>

<p>"Hey, this is Bowser! Who is it?!" he answered desperately.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>"Hi King Dad," Lemmy greeted. There was some wind noise in his background. "I- umm."</p>

<p>"Hey I'm busy here!"</p>

<p>"Oh, well the radio is off air and the internet's slow so we don't know what's up down there. Is the game still playing?"</p>

<p>The Koopa King grit his teeth on the way out of the pool. Why did he have to have a robust moisture-proof dumbphone? Since using that kind of model he was getting check-ins anytime and anywhere, including while falling down a volcano shaft once. "No, I won it already. Technically!"</p>

<p>"Technically? Lol..."</p>

<p>"Erm. It's offa obscure rule ya know," he quickly amended. "Hey, make sure my minions are coming home. If they'd go after me for the crime of whooping their preferred team, they'd go after them for watching the slaughter."</p>

<p>"I'll ask Luddy!"</p>

<p>There came the oft-heard bounce of Lemmy's ball, albeit on a palatable surface, and by the baritone nearby, he'd found his eldest son in seconds.</p>

<p>"-Why aren't you searching? Arm yourself, General!"</p>

<p>"Fiiiine, I'll take the binoculars. Can I customize mine with stickers?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Aww.. wait now I remember. It's Dad."</p>

<p>"What?!"</p>

<p>Then came a clatter and the sounds of struggle as seven kingdoms away, Ludwig kept an arm around Lemmy's face, his little brother tucked under his arm like a football.</p>

<p>"Hello, Vater?..We'll ensure our Koopa Troop operatives arrive home safely, so please! Hurry back."</p>

<p>*Click*</p>

<p>Bowser stared at the brick in his paws. He couldn't! Not yet.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>"You're getting better with those excuses, Bowsy. Smoother than what I said to convince a dozen people that they didn't spot you serving peas."</p>

<p>Bowser ripped off his soggy hair net. "Yuck!"</p>

<p>Mario thumbed backward. "Those were tasty in fact, just salty. I had some."</p>

<p>"NO- Yes. But no. Don't use that name Dinosaur Breath coined. Secondly, it ain't an excuse!"</p>

<p>As Bowser dumped his accessories in the trash, he noticed a note near his station with a number scribbled on it. He pocketed that, Mario not noticing over whatever else he was doing in that back room. The cafeteria was empty, and if Bowser just stomped out of there right then and forgot about this being nice crap, he might make it to a count of thirty before he caused mass panic.</p>

<p>"Is every first day gonna be like this?" a staffer asked.</p>

<p>"As long as we're at max," replied an older hammer bro, washing dishes.</p>

<p>The young dorky lakitu that inquired wiped down the stainless steel pass, near where Mario reappeared, motioning for Bowser.</p>

<p>"Well, if family time is over, we can make some progress." He tossed something scarlet over Bowser head.</p>

<p>"Come on..." he growled, untangling himself. It was a woven cloak and surprisingly his size. "What is this?"</p>

<p>"Your outfit, grandmother."</p>

<p>He whipped back to the plumber, now holding a silver walker and a box of disposable blue face masks.</p>

<p>"We'll come around and reenter from the front with you as an old koopa I'm helping in." He encouragingly draped his arm around him, a little too comfortable already.</p>

<p>Bowser shivered. Mario wasn't just protecting him now, he was luring him down a trail of lunacy with this semi-embrace thing. Maybe, all along, he'd been a double agent and wanted his head on a platter like the rest of his psycho friends. He could feel his warmth and the bristle of his mustache tickled him a little during that brief moment where he stopped them both and was looking out into the parking lot funny, partially at an oil puddle, then shrugged in resignation and kept on. 'We have all the coins in the world to replace it. Shame for the thief I didn't get around to fixing that leak.'</p>

<p>Reentering the front lobby, folks were staring, Bowser feeling particularly naked. He was just about to pull the plug when Mario let his upper arm go finally. He dipped towards the receptionist's office and came back with the most genuine smile he'd seen in a while.</p>

<p>"Can't believe we got this far. In a funny way, thanks for not making this as hard as it coulda been. Hold tight for my signal to come to room 444, okay?" He winked. "Let's-a go."</p>

<p>Kylie Koopa sleuthed the stadium from behind a phone booth. The fact that there still was one of those around was her sign that she was meant to sneak in. Yellow banners from the police blocked the entrances, but due to there being three of them, everything was unsupervised. Camera in hand, she dashed across Starman Lane and went in. Despite the tragedy, it remained awe-inspiring as it always was to emerge from the unlit arched passageways into the area where millions once entertained the diaspora.</p>

<p>Snapping a few shots of the aftermath, the stands, discarded signs, trampled banners, all redolent of the rapid deterioration of order, something tingled her spine, and it had nothing to do with reverence. She tried to shake it out before snooping more thoroughly, around the umpire chair, behind some stands, and locker rooms, where she found Mario's gym bag. She made it to row F of the bleachers when a motorcycle purr made her trip the rest of the way down again. She knew her time was up. The tunnels were amplifying and distorting voices into a thunder-like rumble. Maybe the cops returning to reapply the tape she cut on the way in and being pragmatic at the same time.</p>

<p>The ringing of a bell was the last she heard of that. Must be a 'cat burglar' in a Lucky Bell suit. That would sure be a funny mug shot later for the busted paper.</p><hr />

<p>'Grandma' covered his face with a 'Play Koopa' magazine, not the best choice, though his mind so was removed at the moment he never registered the picture- erm the 'articles' inside it, trying to channel his inner ninji and disappear. Taking up three seats, he was hard to miss while deep in enemy territory. This is why he and Mario hung out at remote locations. Places like the Waffle Kingdom wouldn't bat an eye at them.. unless someone looked up who they were.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Far down the West hospital wing, Mario abruptly stopped before room 444, making the others step on his heels. Not meaning to get caught up in himself like that, he apologized and let the others trickle in ahead of him. The doctor's large blocky form hid the status on most of the monitors between Toad and Daisy's beds. Unceremoniously, he spun to face the crew.</p>

<p>"Just checking records," he droned.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, doctor?" Peach asked.</p>

<p>He waddled around her and the rest as nimbly as a rock slab monster could. She gave that up momentarily, venturing closer to Toad's bed. He was like a plank of wood to her horror.</p>

<p>"..Mario, do they look green to you too?" Yoshi asked.</p>

<p>Luigi bolted to roll the mash dimmer all the way up. They hadn't imagined the greenish hue of their skin, super apparent on pale-skinned Toad, but tinting the bronze hue of the Sarasalandian as well. The bed squeaked as Luigi grabbed the rail of Daisy's bed. "He walked away with them like this? Figlio di puttana!"</p>

<p>Mario took it all in with great difficulty, spinning to notice that Boo had frozen in the threshold with wide eyes.</p>

<p>"…I'm sorry I.. it flashed before me.. memories of.." They choked up. "A morgue."</p>

<p>The princess and Luigi wailed sharply. She latched onto Mario. "Eldstar, it cannot be!"</p>

<p>Yoshi brought his ear up from Toad's chest first and then Daisy's. "They're still alive for now," he informed steadily.</p>

<p>On the topic of heartbeats, Mario's clashed against Peach's until he gently eased out of their embrace, securing her upper sleeves. "Peach, we can save this. Thanks to you we're seeing this now and not four hours later or something. I'll update 'You Know Who' and get someone back in here. If they act up they'll be checking themselves in from my special 'plumber whack'…"</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>"Hey, King!"</p>

<p>The Kart and Driver magazine slipped from the grandma in the corner with one leg crossed over the other. "H-huh?"</p>

<p>"Oops. Sorry." Emery flushed, scrunching down behind the row of waiting chairs before him. "Any updates, King? Someone will snitch on me if I'm anywhere but here with my mom or on my rooftop station."</p>

<p>Ah, Emery was a more doe-eyed and spirited version of that Nass up there, though if she insisted on mixing her business with his', she might acquire the poorly concealed cynical disposition of the mother long before thirty..</p>

<p>"-Nothin yet, Fangirl. I'm waiting 'round and frankly, don't want to get cha in trouble."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about it. I'm already a social outcast because I've liked you since you were still a villain. Yeah, I don't mean your new revision, the old stuff..Or maybe because I don't mind seeing blood and guts.. Anyway, here's all I can tell you."</p>

<p>She told him all she knew in a half whisper while pretending to consider options in a snack machine nearby. Besides Toad and Daisy, almost fifty more were just like them, all from around the time the game was suspended. That the staff wasn't paying attention was incorrect, they were monitoring closely, and what they were waiting for scared her. Dr. Prof. Koopa cryptically mentioned once that he was back in the saddle again. -But he was no cowboy! Or she was too young to get that phrase.</p>

<p>"Ahhh!" Bowser shot to his feet, ripping the cloak off in the process. A chorus of alarm from toads snapped him back to reality too late. Chairs were flipped, visitors scrambled out, and others jumped up to grab the spinning ceiling fans. He pushed beyond them, going somewhere without knowing where to start. Suddenly a plumber dropped in and was hit by the stampede. He stood up, missing his hat, confused and horrified alike at the pandemonium.</p>

<p>Bowser towered over his rival, screaming belligerently. "I gotta see our tennis rivals!"</p>

<p>Mario leaped acrobatically to Bowser's side and pulled his spiked collar down to his level, flipping into his stock character. "They're not in the mood for visitors, Koopa!"</p>

<p>Underneath the spontaneous applause from the grateful dozen, he dragged Bowser through the automatic doors. Once out of earshot and on the street, he signed heavily.</p>

<p>"Why'd you do that? I was coming to get you!"</p>

<p>Bowser forced himself to smirk. "Oh well, thanks. Let's go."</p>

<p>"We can't the easy way anymore, jerk.." He seized the koopa's arm. "We can sneak in the window, though. Hurry. It ain't pretty."</p>

<p>As they continued at a brisk pace, Bowser tried to divulge several times unsuccessfully. If he was breaking everything by doing absolutely nothing, what would trying to help do? Mario and co were on the right trail anyway and they'd never take his word. Plus, it was uncharted territory being together in the open in a semi-busy town, though as fate would have it, the drama had to start again.</p>

<p>"Bowser!" A bob-omb heading towards them on the public sidewalk spun around and ran.</p>

<p>"Crap! Come on!" Mario urged.</p>

<p>Then a birdo on a bike spotted them hand in hand from across the street and was so distracted she smacked into a stop sign.</p>

<p>"You can try lifting those things, you know!"</p>

<p>"I freakin know that!"</p>

<p>Snapping out of a daze, Bowser cooperated somewhat and they made it around the block to the West wing. They dove into the bushes partially obscuring Toad and Daisy's window. Mario heard some sort of alarm blaring over raised voices, all muffled by glass. He felt in vain around the sides for a latch.</p>

<p>"Erm. Fine." Bowser carefully applied pressure to the entire pane, making something creak. "Whoops!"</p>

<p>"Momma mia!" Mario's attempt to catch the glass was just as catastrophic, sliding off of his cotton gloves and shattering on the floor inside. It bumped one of the computer status monitors out of the dummy mode it was in, displaying afterward a standard Mushroomsoft 10 OS screen.</p>

<p>Azul had used some gobbledygook tactics to hold Peach and Yoshi's attention in the doorway, and was proficient enough at it. He said he'd gone to Mushroom College. Or maybe that was part of his ruse, but with those screens down he dismissed it as a 'darn automatic update' and sped away. While Yoshi and Luigi and others made eventually futile attempts to track him down, Bowser's big head was looking in, stomach-churning at Toad and Daisy's state.</p>

<p>"Mario," he sputtered. "Dr. Professor dealt with what they got. .. And it might been when he was with-"</p>

<p>Beep beep beep, went an alarm, drowning him out.</p>

<p>"We must have been spotted. Wonder how?" Mario pinched between his eyes, tone dripping in sarcasm.</p><hr />

<p>Dark Land had a diversity of environments seldom recognized, torrential rains frequent in some urban areas, parched around Bowser Castle. That desertic soil became the cushion for an out-of-control airship.</p>

<p>Thud!</p>

<p>Larry yanked off his headphones, looking around. "Sis! You playing Morton records again?"</p>

<p>Without diverting her attention away from her dating simulator, Wendy flung a Wii Wheel at him. "Like I'd play some craptastic music he likes. Didn't I 'accidentally' drop that in the garbage disposal?"</p>

<p>The pulsating beats cut from a trio of big stereo cabinets Morton had wired up. "Oh no, not my limited edition, rare, seven inch from DJ Deadbone5!"</p>

<p>"God.." Larry groaned, falling back in defeat.</p>

<p>Lemmy was in the opposite corner of the room, where Junior would be if not at camp, scooping up the multicolored blocks to build with when a whiff of smoke struck his nostrils. "Dinner?" He checked his watch. Nada.</p>

<p>Iggy's head snapped up from the non-domestic special edition translucent Gameboy. He was a lanky eighteen-year-old, unmissable if he was around with his lime green hair, gelled to sprout from his head, though seldom seen in the den compared to the basement or his lab. "My radioactive microwave downstairs!... Hahaha, no that blew up last week because of Roy's burrito."</p>

<p>"Aw, shuddup, you told me I could!" Roy griped from the other more ragged couch.</p>

<p>Larry then stuffed his ears, only to hear the notification anyway.</p>

<p>"Attention! Mandatory meeting behind the castle!" the message stated, using that intercom app too. "Seriously!" Unanimously, his sister pausing her game which she would never otherwise do, the koopalings filed out.</p>

<p>"F!" Larry screeched.</p>

<p>Behind the castle, their primary airship had reappeared embedded bow first. Orangey red dirt mounds from the impact were littered up to a mile away, some making it onto the rooftop of the castle. So it turned out Morton was right, which was already an occurrence with the frequency of a Star Festival, but Kammy Koopa had stopped still she dropped. She made her egress from an emergency hatch on the top and slid down from the hull to the ground like nothing had happened, arms full of bags.</p>

<p>"~Dearies, I got something for you!" the crone sang, shuffling across the field.</p>

<p>A couple of them cheered for the 'cool grandma'. The way Larry saw it, Kamek was the 'koopalings are ordained warlords', Kammy was the 'you're just kids!' and Bowser in the middle. Sheesh.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a particularly Ludwig sized dirt mound started to jiggle, scaring him.</p>

<p>"Freaking what is that?" he gasped.</p>

<p>Bloodshot eyes appeared from the mound, followed by a red hot face and then the rest of the body. "What in Eldstar's name is wrong with you crazy woman?!"</p>

<p>Kammy contently strolled up, her head poking around the stacks of shopping bags. "Luddy-dear, you know how I have lil problem reaching the brake pedal sometimes, ee hee hee! Now chill out, boy!" She tossed a yellow Banana Bird Republic bag full of hair spray his way.</p>

<p>The eldest koopaling caught it on reflex and then passed it to Wendy. As a bald (but empowered) female, she thought it was a diss and slapped him with the bag before realizing that some advanced foot care products were in there, so she saved face suddenly and tried to thank him all coyly.</p>

<p>"Everyone focus!" Ludwig snapped his fingers. "Time?"</p>

<p>Lemmy checked his wrist watch again. "There's been exactly zero minutes and no seconds since we've been standing here."</p>

<p>"Lemmy-sama, your watch is drawn on your wrist with crayon. Ooh, I should invent a watch that can freeze time like yours!" Iggy giggled.</p>

<p>With a loud aggravated huff, Ludwig dashed inside the airship so fast Kammy spun in place, shopping bags flinging off. They waited awkwardly until Ludwig emerged from the hatch. Using a thick colorful quilt, likely as seen on TV at some point to shield his nose and mouth from dust, he sat there instead of sliding down and seemed to be busy dialing a number. He screwed up a few times because everyone knew he sucked at touch screens. Eventually, he asked Iggy about the number of his friends from the Play-N-Tirade.</p>

<p>"So and so!" the nerd called over.</p>

<p>Now what was this mess about, Larry wondered, flabbergast. He wouldn't get it from the source, Iggy was already fighting with Kammy over some mall treasure.</p>

<p>"-Hands off, sonny! I need that to keep up with the sock, cauldron, and cooking ware collection," the elderly magikoopa slapped him with her broom.</p>

<p>Iggy held the pocket calculator over her short stature. "First let me borrow this and harvest the proprietary and out-of-production CPU microchip.."</p>

<p>Ludwig returned, pleased with himself. "-Very well, we have a ride."</p>

<p>"It's totes underground, Luddy!" Wendy complained.</p>

<p>He dropped a bundle of shovels before her heels and her brother's three-toed feet. "Words have meaning, sister-mine. It is partially underground, get it right. Now, riddle me this. What has two thumbs, a shell on its back, and a fantastic r supreme commander if I do say so myself? You. Get to work!"</p>

<p>Lemmy was the first to comply, followed by the others that 'might as well'.</p>

<p>Ludwig tied that quilt around his neck. Coastal breezes battering Darkland could get unexpectedly cold if no volcanos were erupting. Thankfully the forecast for where they were going would be mild, at least until they showed up of course.</p><hr />

<p>Mitch Toad's black luxury sedan skidded to a stop at Starman Lane's second or third red light. As sharp as it was on the outside, his nosebleed was ruining the trade in value big time. He didn't have asprin for the searing headache, nor facial tissues in the glove box, so he was ruining his expensive suit and a very nice notebook he'd just bought. No matter. At least Kylie should be safe for now. He'd whipped Susie so thoroughly, he was begging for mercy like Francis the geek did after Mitch was about to leak the ending of Starship X-Naut TV that time.</p>

<p>The light changed to green so he mashed that pedal.</p>

<p>
  <em>~Ding ding ding.</em>
</p>

<p>Then -His blood ran cold. There, he spotted it a block away, an oncoming Mushroom Bus veering into in his lane, though fingers curling around the wheel rigidly, he ran out of time and was smashed into on the front driver's side corner. His car's frame was compressing like an accordion, somersaulting into the park while the public transportation vehicle, continued to roll until overrunning a brick hedge beyond the intersection. No brakes were ever pressed by the warm corpse inside. Back in the park, within the mangled remains of the Lexus, the green toad tried to wiggle from behind the deflated airbag, but could not move nor scream. Life began to fade.</p>

<p>The first on the scene was Koopa. He was one of those ambulance chasers in a literal sense, not that he was fishing for a lawsuit, though Lakitu Bro might have been, of course he digressed. He left early for lunch and was five minutes from home, cutting through the city park when that horrible scene unfolded. Jogging in place, he remained on the line to emergency services line until he blacked out, whacked in the back of the head with a green Bowser tennis racket. The unconscious fitness junkie collapsed at the 'feet' of a dark floating figure.</p>

<p>Surveying the carnage, the attacker's eyes squinted slightly due to astigmatism. He approached anyway and leered at what was left of Mitch closely, unable to help himself.</p>

<p>"Never even knew who really as, bro. Heh, sounds like today's journalists.."</p>

<p>His lips curled upwards at the journalist's lack of reply, vocally and on that other wavelength they could access. He was about to change things forever, so to get back to that he vanished like the boo he was…</p><hr />

<p>The sands of time buffeted Toad Town until it widdled down to a simple village. There were no paved roads or street signs, and the city, or what would be called a city later was so flat that from the southwest port, the robed roble could scan the horizon and see the coliseum, Mushroom Castle, a forest of Super Bell trees that mostly got in their way, and Star Hill all at once. Stars, he forgot how they were technically in a valley like that.</p>

<p>Snapping from meta observations, the noble drew away from the sea with an empty glass bowl, hiding it as requested before making the short sprint to the pavilion. Mushroom retainer number twenty-seven appreciated her pet being set free before it was found in her quarters and something else happened, but could not show it as the tardy nobel scooted by their floor section to sit in the high hairs. Other red toads identical to him were so engrossed in the live music on stage that they didn't notice.</p>

<p>The elites rarely attended small, 'podunk' stage shows, but spearheaded by the young Duke they had to see this particular afternoon program, and when one of them decided on something, they all had to follow. The purple curtains slid to the side, revealing underwater reefs built of wood and bloopers hanging on strings, accompanied by trumpet blasts from the production crew.</p>

<p>Ten minutes into The Ugly Mermaid, the Earl was yearning for an excuse to run. Everything was cloudy and hazy, and he couldn't quell the agitation he felt if plunged into the ocean like that pet cheep cheep. The only thing that kept his butt in his regal prestigious spot was the sight of background actor number fifteen, a tall human dressed as a Yurarinm, gawking as her line came up.</p>

<p>She muttered something like, "I got enough problems, dawg. I think I'm dreamin'," before a hook pulled that one off state.</p>

<p>After blinking, the Earl jumped down and evacuated the tent, frantically searching about behind the rear where the stage lead. She was missing among the actors staring at him like he was a freak. A director tried to shake him off, a big toad named Saul. The Earl grappled back with the ambitious orange toad. Having some underhanded deal with the last employee the King and the Earl recommended they cut, Saul had been a thorn in his side ever since. Flashest went out behind his eyes. Maybe a professor, another one in the future, would warn of these lapses or..</p>

<p>When the confrontation happened, the Earl barely won, lacking a weapon against the dagger carrying psycho. This time he'd just kill him. The Earl snatched the biggest heaviest tent spike and charged the orange toad.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Forty years in the future, a grayer haired Mr. Toad semi-consciously reached for whatever was in proximity of his bed. He grasped the metal stand propping the monitors. Luigi swiveled to his friend as he rose in bed like in the Night of the Living Pionpi.</p><hr />

<p>"-I appreciate your concern for my welfare, but this was drastic. My enemy is roaming 'civilly'. What happened to the previous standard of care, organization, husbandry, and communication?"</p>

<p>While the ringing alarms were disabled in the lobby, they were still faintly audible in other parts of the hospital and red lights continually flashed.</p>

<p>"We are still determining their condition," Nass muttered to Peach, avoiding eye contact with Mario who folded his arms beside her.</p>

<p>"-They giving you problem-? Ah, uh, nevermind. Hmm hmm hmm.." the whomp doctor hummed in passing from the East wing to the West.</p>

<p>Peach forced herself to ignore that. "Nass, You stated that the call for security came from within this facility, so would you know who authorized that unnecessary measure?"</p>

<p>"N-no."</p>

<p>"...Oh why did I ever hire you back then as the receptionist!" the princess blurted, immediately regretting it.</p>

<p>Nass stared blankly before shooting up from her chair. "I'm just following orders!"</p>

<p>Mario slammed his fists down on the desk. "My brother wrote those procedure codes of yours down. Yoshi looked them up online and Bowser heard via a mole in your organization that you DO know what's wrong. Just cause you've seen me beat up baddies for years doesn't mean I won't slap a few of you around-"</p>

<p>The defiance visibly drained from Nass as she collapsed into her seat, holding down a button. "Dr. Terrace, please come back, thank you!"</p>

<p>"Aw, stop playing around' Nass," Dr. Terrace grumbled behind their backs. "The straight dope is this. We can kick them all out. The princess doesn't own us as of the vote this morning. Azul." He whistled for the blue shy guy like he was some mutt on the street.</p>

<p>The young nurse flashed a rude gesture as he rolled a cart by. "What dude?"</p>

<p>"Escort them, my child."</p>

<p>Mario pulled the rock baddie closer by the stereoscope. "How about no. This is your last chance to-</p>

<p>A yellow blur burst through the entrances. Mario severed his hold on the corrupt doc to take Peach and dive with her for cover. Azul bopped aside along with this cart of gauze and everything else blown out of the way. Whatever that was, it zoned in on the receptionist's desk.</p>

<p>The dust cloud settled- "Dis is Jimmy M. of the Mushroom Kingdom Disease Control Unit!" announced a short monty mole in a bright yellow hazmat suit. "We got tipped off that there's some real bad ones 'ere."</p>

<p>Nass peeked over her desk. "There must be some mistake, James. We didn't-"</p>

<p>James hopped into her window, landing on top of the file cabinet. As it fell over he dug into the papers, flinging them around. As Mario was helping Peach to her feet, dazed, they heard tinny chatter from a radio.</p>

<p>"Dis is it," James said into a walkie-talkie, choice documents spread on Nass's desk before him. "Now just need ta pick 'bout five of em."</p>

<p>This prompted a mega goomba, a koopa paratroopa, and a wiggler to rush in with cots. Splitting off every which way, they returned seconds later with three patients, sickly green.</p>

<p>"Can't youse count? Five!" the MKDCU agent fussed, muddying up Nass's desk again. "Do I gots to carry em? Gimme some-"</p>

<p>"Heeelp!" A haunting voice commanded their attention from the west wing. Boo phased through the double doors before they were kicked open by Yoshi, eyes bloodshot and frazzled.</p>

<p>"Yosh?!"</p>

<p>Ignoring Mario, Yoshi whipped back, dashing into the hall again and returning with Luigi in his arms. His clothes were hanging off, his hat missing, skin flushed like a beet. "Look at what he did to our boy!"</p>

<p>Toad dragged his feet out, upright but groaning, glazed over, and green, wielding a metal pole twice the length of him. Azul made the mistake of being the nearest living thing, so he was batted across the lobby, over their heads, and out a window.</p>

<p>"Whatthe?" Bowser was following the commotion from outside, the nurse splitting right next to him. "FungusFace is up and wanting a rematch or-" His eyes widened. "Shoot-"</p>

<p>"He'll do. Says here dat one had a roommate. Get her too." James evacuated Nass's space as the goomba agent returned for Toad. He took a whack in the and cursed him out, but with the wiggler returning, they slapped him on another cot. The parakoopa and James himself wheeled Daisy's bed out. Dr. Terrace had recovered by then, and simply stood aside indifferently as they lost their fourth and fifth patients. The fiver went into a big truck parked out there. Bowser witnessed it. He might have tackled his way in with a running start, but it was driving away too quickly. Didn't stop him from chasing anyway, really giving the citizens a scare.</p>

<p>Back inside, where the lobby was destroyed, Peach latched on to Mario. "Stars, this can't be happening!"</p>

<p>The alarms everywhere were silenced as a somewhat strung-out Dr. Prof. Koopa strolled into the ruins, clothes and lab coat ruffled.</p>

<p>"My Dear 'Sweet Pea'," he began petulantly, "The rumors are true. You are no longer the director here. Give up."</p><hr />

<p>Mario shook his head, standing and waving, trying to rile them up. "No, all we did was it the pause button. Don't say that!"</p>

<p>The four left the bastion that had crumbled in their eyes and regrouped at Club 64, via walking, as the Mushroom Bus was involved in a bizarre accident and they'd all temporarily stopped. The Mach Bike was stolen earlier too, but Mario didn't want to pile on the bad news, saving that to share with Luigi privately later. The landmark diner in Toad Town was known for its cozy atmosphere over the decades, a notable distinguisher against sleeker and larger competitors like Club Gamecube across the street. They sat far in the back of the restaurant, alongside the often therapeutic fish tank. He kept her arm around the princess's quivering form, the tears that once marred her face long dried. Yoshi watched a bulky old television set to closed captioned infomercials without actually watching anything at all.</p>

<p>"Umm," Luigi spoke up, holding the icepack to his face, "Did we really let Bowser run off like that?"</p>

<p>Yoshi swiveled his chair around. "That is bothering me as well."</p>

<p>Mario bite the inside of his cheek, unsure if his struggle was his deep seated tendency to please everybody or cognitive dissonance. "-None of this has to do with Bowser!"</p>

<p>"Don't be so certain.." Peach spoke just above TV volume. "As you know, I don't forget faces and during those glimpses we had from passing by rooms, the sick were attendees at the game this morning."</p>

<p>Yoshi patted the princess' hand before turning to Mario with fiery zeal. "What is conspicuously missing from that picture? A single koopa scum on the mends, despite being half of the audience. It's a targeted attack, Mario! Of course, we all realize the hospital is scummy in its own way, but I can't think of any other reason why they would kick the princess off the board like that except for permitting our worst enemy to stick around. "</p>

<p>"Yoshi!.. I.." Peach lost her words.</p>

<p>"It's plausible," Luigi grunted, his head low otherwise. "Boo got my text to meet here. Thank the stars. Boo said osme private chat rooms have some 'juicy' info on Bowser too."</p>

<p>Mario sprang up from his seat. "Bathroom."</p>

<p>Mario slipped out a back door, rounding the block on the lookout. He craned his neck upwards occasionally, pacing back and forth in the shaded alley. By the time he spotted a Clown Car in the sky, he was shaking, all of that anxiety morphing into rage. The instant his rival squeezed the copter into the tight space, he was about to strangle him.</p>

<p>"Bowser, I can't ignore the chatty crows out there anymore! The tennis game was the only event your minions could come to and that's the one where this happens? And then not a single one of your minions are sick with psychotic episodes either?"</p>

<p>Bowser would have normally been amused at Mario clawing through his hair, jittering all over the place. This wasn't funny though. "No I don't get it either! We shoulda drilled into Theo more, but everything was happening so fast. " He glanced off to the sky, framed by the two brick walls scaled up. "We need a do-over. Give me five minutes with Dr. Professor Creep. We'll learn something I promise."</p>

<p>Mario absorbed him for a while, losing tension. "I believe you... for some reason."</p>

<p>"For some reason?" Bowser stepped closer, his red eyes flashing with intrigue. "Did we meet yesterday? Hey, this is Bowser, pleased to meet cha. I was the BEST villain in the Mushroom World till four months ago, when I didn't lose or quit or nothin', I just retired ON MY OWN TERMS.. but maybe with the support of this hairy faced loser in red." He offered a scaly hand. "Think his name is-"</p>

<p>"Alright, I get it." Mario shook his hand, a smile creeping up. "I never doubted I think, it's just, getting inundated with their ideas was getting to me.." he admitted, still clasping Bowser's paw. "I'll abate the rest then we can bash some skulls in that wretched MK East. In the meantime, hide out at my house. Angry mobs will never look there."</p>

<p>His keys clank softly as they fell into the calloused open palm of his nemesis. That sealed it in his mind. Maybe Bowser was innocent.. but this was still a mistake, if hard to recognize with the Koopa King glowing like he was in a steakhouse.</p>

<p>"Though it'd have to be a Boo Moon before you did something like that. Deal, Beardy. I won't wreck the place."</p>

<p>When Mario snuck back into Club 64, Yoshi yanked him right back out again. Everyone was waiting on the bench, tabs already paid. It was tricky without Mario, but they had a plan!</p><hr />

<p>"Jessie, have ya heard from that ol' Mitch since this afternoon? Just curious."</p>

<p>The redhead didn't know, returning to her job of sitting pretty. Kylie returned to her space, in deep thought. Toad and Daisy weren't photoed drinking that green soda, identified now as a non-domestic brand called FungusUp, but there was only one promo guy with them and audience members had them, so it was reasonable to infer such at this point. She made a call to the local station to collect some of them as evidence, then tried to contact to someone at MK East. They weren't picking up. In desperation she left a voicemail for Mario, cooking up an excuse that she'd found his duffle bag so if he wanted to get it, that'd be cool.. Also if he could throw some weight around with his stature that'd be great too-</p>

<p>"This is the latest one, sir."</p>

<p>Kylie rolled her chair back. The customer was a noki in a Hawaiian shirt and black sunglasses, scanning a newspaper.</p>

<p>"See your stories?"</p>

<p>The noki slapped some coins on her desk. "Merci." He waltzed out and into an Aston Mushroom sports car at a parking meter. It had a Toad Town license plate, and that was the suspicious part.</p>

<p>Leaving behind the cozier section of Toad Town for the modern metro, where it was borderline hectic and the length of the buildings stretched upwards exponentially he knew he was running out of time.</p>

<p>Sirens rang and down the main streets, substantiating that 'juicy' news on the message boards. Bowser minions were dispersed like a micro-goomba infestation around downtown. Some were trouble, albeit with small things and justifying surveillance and alarm, though most were committing the crime of simply 'existing', which the pact condoned explicitly. A few shop's online accounts said that if they spotted that tattoo on an 'enemy species' customer, they'd bar them totally. The princess's reaction was that 'those shops were drumming for attention'...</p>

<p>Mario scanned the nervous but eager faces of his friends, trying to sound as spontaneous as possible. "Hey. Maybe we'd better hold off a sec."</p>

<p>Yoshi shook a fist. "Mario, that old creep is finished. I could even take Dr. Prof. alone if we squared off, and you know I'm no spring huffin' puffin.."</p>

<p>Peach's thin eyebrows furrowed. "It should not have to come to violence, nevertheless they have lost my respect. No, I will not grovel when we get there. It's not about that anymore Mario! I can build another hospital. It's about the patients, it's about Mr. Toad and Daisy, and we must end their schemes."</p>

<p>"..So we agree on the sabotage angle, not Bowser. ..He's not around anymore so don't worry about that."</p>

<p>"In our presence or not, yes Bowser!" Yoshi exclaimed.</p>

<p>He gave a start. "What?"</p>

<p>"Remember that voicemail?"</p>

<p>The red plumber would have rather been warped to the Minus World, trapped for all eternity. Kylie had his duffle bag. Besides that, the Fungus Ups the audience drank came from a truck with a Neo Bowser City plate. That was a massive clue passed to Snifit Patrol. Of course, all it meant was that the crook was Darklandian. Bowser didn't run that city, that was the neo part. In fact that's not even a word he'd be using naturally.</p>

<p>"I understand you, but my brother has a point," Luigi increased his previously slower pace to step in between the dino and princess. "We could be marching into a trap. Why don't we investigate the MDKCU to give us a buffer period? Who knows, considering how well they stole the show, a collab might be the key to victory."</p>

<p>Boo nodded with a little extra perk, otherwise hiding behind him.</p>

<p>If he was simply apprehensive after being attacked or being a genius Mario didn't know. Either way, he loved him, as his logic melted away the nearly tangible intensity of those two.</p>

<p>"All of this is sound, I suppose. One moment." Peach pressed one button for a speed dial, conjuring one of her loyal castle servants right away. "Thank you, dear." She snapped shut the flip phone.</p>

<p>"No, thank you," Luigi said. "If they could find a way to kick you out, they could find a way to do worse to us. I'll meet you all at the castle in a moment. Kylie has my memory card too."</p>

<p>"From our GameCube or something?"</p>

<p>As it would be ridiculous at this point to keep the charade, he revealed the camera. "Surprise, Mario. After this mess is over, I'll show you all the photos I took where you can spot the boogers in your nose from up on row C."</p><hr />

<p>A part of him was excited to enter the uncharted territory. Yes, someone like him, who'd been all around the Mushroom World and beyond, not exactly welcomed, and often with the intentions to do some bad stuff, but still. This tiny by his standards home in this goody neighborhood, like out of a princess-approved real estate magazine, was about to be the highlight of his day. Was it a letdown? The moment he tiptoed inside and almost caused an avalanche, well, no. He was still awe-struck, just in a bad way at the hoard of brand-new and lightly used stuff piling to the ceiling in wobbly stacks. Nothing was dust coated, so the Marios were keeping everything 'clean' but not investing in a storehouse. Was some ordinance disallowing it?</p>

<p>He was so glad to be from Dark Land...</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>"Put it on meats, vegetables, everything. You have to buy it to taste it!" the chef on Zess TV broadcast. The bumpty with dyed purple tufts of hair held up bottles of Purple Sauce, all slightly different shades.</p>

<p>
  <em>
    </em></p>

<p>
  <em>"But what does it taste like?" a live caller asked.</em>
</p>

<p>
  <em>
    </em></p>

<p>
  <em>"It's a unique flavor."</em>
</p><em>

<p>"No seriously."</p>

<p>"Do you wanna buy or not? Next caller.."</p></em>

<p></p>

<p>Brrzt.</p>

<p>
  <em>
    </em></p>

<p>
  <em>~On the big brightly lit stage, a wiggler country star in a stunning sparkly red dress had a double-necked guitar strapped on, about to sing.</em>
</p>

<p>
  <em>
    </em></p>

<p>

<p>Bowser clicked it off, disgusted with the flashy colorful box even with his mind on more present matters. A loud ruckus drew him to the window blinds. He was told to be careful about Gill T. next door, not dudes in orange hats driving a motorbike into their yard, muddying it up.</p>

<p>A realization slapped him across the face with a brick. It was Mario's Mach Bike. The 'I heart Sarasaland' sticker on the back, the vanity Toad Town license plate that spelled '644evar', and the oil leak he was supposed to fix last week. Heck, Bowser put most of those dents in it during races. The dark boo's hat was stamped Mushroom Press too. He knew those creeps could write some bad articles, usually maligning him, but stealing bikes and returning to the victim's house to double dip or somethin?</p>

<p>Bowser kicked the door open. "What do ya think you're doing?"</p>

<p>The guy spun at him, raising his cap with a flash of shock. The Koopa King wouldn't let him go that easily, lounging and sliding across the mud to yank the boo tail first. With the baddie snatched, he quickly rolled into the house again, pressing him against the wall.</p>

<p>"Quick, say the Mushroomcratic Oath. Or else!"</p>

<p>The diabolical stranger said the full thing, only confusing him more. "Now, I don't do monologues or write life stories. When I get to where I want in life, I might still be a wandering Zoo-"</p>

<p>Bowser's grip faltered unknowingly. "Who freaking are you?!"</p>

<p>"That was my name!" Zoo yelled back. "Stop wasting my time."</p>

<p>"Wait.. so you REALLY work at the press?"</p>

<p>"Yep, it worked out and now I'm liberal and gay."</p>

<p>"What kingdom has that party, and why are you happy about it?"</p>

<p>"God you're slow bro.."</p>

<p>In the blink of an eye, he'd phased through his arms and the wall. Bowser stumbled outside again, into the blinding sun to get mud flung in his face from the spinning bike wheels. Shaking it off, a bigger engine vibrated the ground, a Bill Blaster about to swing into the driveway next door. Reddening, Bowser dashed into the house again.</p>

<p>"GAAAH!"</p>

<p>Ripping his hair out, the king stomped around inside, stacks of junk crashing around. He had to sneak his way out of here and do something, and there might only be one way to do it.</p><hr />

<p>Boo loitered in front of "Tennis game of Terror" as a sign on the arcade said, and then sped forward to catch back up, tugging on the green plumber.</p>

<p>"Weegee, hold on!"</p>

<p>"If it's another spike spray painting a wall, don't worry, we'll deal with it-"</p>

<p>"No, uh.. I have to show you something I didn't before. It's sensitive I guess. About Mario."</p>

<p>"Oh.. My brother's skin is pretty thick, Booigi," he mentioned, following them into the vacant Toad Town cleaners. "It can't be that bad can it?"</p>

<p>The boo diddly dithered between rows of washing machines, debating something. "Y-you be the judge.. Check your phone."</p>

<p>After clicking the link, Luigi's heart stopped. Courtesy of an anonymous message boards user with a simple caption of 'lol it's like fanfiction or something', a photo showed Mario and Bowser walking on the sidewalks casually holding hands. Mario appeared henpecked yet content while Bowser was full of glee, like he was in a steakhouse, captured today very close to the hospital. With his keen eyes there were no traces of editing, manipulation, or any other photo trickery.</p>

<p>Luigi kept his nose down, eyes clinched. The only sounds were the low whirl of the machines.</p>

<p>Boo inched closer. "Sorry."</p>

<p>"No, Booigi. Don't." The green plumber brushed his sleeve across his eyes. "Toad and I knew they were tight in a rivalry way. It's why my brother was squeaky wheel to Peach over forming a pact for sure as well. But it sucks that he's being selfish like this."</p>

<p>"..Luigi, I don't know what to say.."</p>

<p>"You couldn't get the full picture." Luigi folded his arms, letting the tears roll off. "My brother.. The 'Mario' you know.. When we moved here he decided to be the most blameless, most altruistic, and just hero ever, and I was skeptical, but he proved me wrong again and again. He'd never let anyone get in the way of his vow, not me when I wasn't brave enough, not even his relationships with women. But now Bowser. ..Bowser is the reason why he's off his game and lying to us. We have to go."</p>

<p>Boo swiveled as he marched beyond the candy machines and towards the entrance. "W-weegee?"</p>

<p>"Let's go."</p><hr />

<p>He hopped into the backseat with Yoshi, the Birthday Girl driven by a subordinate of Peach a little tight, but the trip ahead brief. Toadette was more than a pink pigtailed toad in the vast sea that was Mario's company, this one was going places. Straight out of college, Peach let her be her personal assistant, and thus she was the one with the prestigiously shuttling them around.</p>

<p>As they shifted into gear and rolled off, slotting into the light traffic, the young girlish toad and Peach shared a glance, appeared to eye at the red plumber in the mirrors, and giggled covertly. Even Yoshi winked at him. It was distracting him from the wanted ad he was trying to post over the bike.</p>

<p>"Is the stubble thing really that hot now?" he whispered.</p>

<p>"Eh, I'll defer to the ladies," Yoshi laughed, drumming his fingers on the leathery armrest.</p>

<p>Interestingly HIS lady wouldn't be elucidating, as he hadn't touched his phone outside of searching news clips since Club 64. Before Mario touched on that, the castle drew near at the top of Royal Raceway. Banners in support of Toad winning waved with the wind up high. No one had gotten to those, likely due to whatever issue was causing them to splash in water like it had been a rainstorm and find more streaming from windows and doors, overflowing the moat.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>"Too many of you are speaking. Where did it start?" Mario asked, standing around in ankle high water. Others in the background were dragging water-logged furniture from the inner rooms to the drier mezzanine.</p>

<p>"The kitchen. The basement. Upstairs. Outside. Inside," her toads all answered at once.</p>

<p>"Enough excuses!" grumbled Toadsworth at the top of the red carpeted staircase. The older brown spotted mushroom man shuffled down each step, walking stick in tote. He slid up his glasses one more time upon reaching the bottom.</p>

<p>"-Master Mario? I did not know you were arriving so soon to help us with this predicament. The pipe downstairs burst today. My Princess," he added gravely. "Your castle has been in a deluge for hours now. We were trying to handle the matter, for we knew you were dealing with other ordeals."</p>

<p>"Yeah, like the tennis game and the bus driver murderer on the loose!" a muscular blue toad added.</p>

<p>Toadsworth directed his glare his way. "Bucken-Berry, the latter is only hearsay at this time!"</p>

<p>"Oh, stars help us," Peach mumbled, shoulders slumping. Thousands of coins worth of damage was happening before her eyes.</p>

<p>Mario wrapped an arm around her. "Yeah, on it. You and Yosh jump on the computer."</p>

<p>He gave her a quick peck on the cheek. Some of the younger toads cooed and Peach herself flushed bright red. As Mario tread downstairs, she was half flustered half annoyed at her heart fluttering. Measures like that were for show. To prop up the image they mutually decided needed fortification, but his bravado was especially attractive today with the beard shadow thing and.. Ugh emotions..</p>

<p>Batting such silly notions aside, she brought Yoshi higher into the castle and through corridors, eventually into a library.</p>

<p>The maze of shelves went overly high for Yoshi, and his big nose was tickled by dust the toads probably couldn't reach. The entire area had still air, like a time capsule, especially the beige computer. Some handsomely salaried toads he crossed had new phones in their pockets, but the sovereign of the kingdom that? Her dad might have been in control of the kingdom when that desktop came out!</p>

<p>He took a seat as the princess typed away. The MKDCU was Ran by James Monty and Parabilly Koopa, a co-founder, with additional agents 'Richard G.', 'Wiggletron B.', and 'Sebastian B.'. According to a blog on them, they were commission-based health inspectors with a drop-off point at that crazed Dr. Toadley's clinic..</p>

<p>"That's not far at all," she mouthed.</p>

<p>"It's not." He made her jump. "Sorry Princess. Let's update Mario."</p>

<p>They printed a page or two and stood. "Computers cost a billion dragon coins on the island. If I convince my darlin that even kids here can afford the good stuff, maybe she'll want to come down more," he said lightheartedly.</p>

<p>"She should.. That would be wonderful."</p>

<p>Though she appeared passive, perhaps resolute to him, inwardly...The stars might bless Mario's oldest buddy, but for her, she'd be left pleading. The web of darkness had already ensnared them all.</p><hr />

<p>"-This one's outta date, Steve! Just muddling the case!" Kylie Koopa ripped a paper from the cork board and crumpled it in her hands. "Even if he had a passport for Flipside for five years, the point is he had the tattoo. He's the eighth victim."</p>

<p>"My mistake, doll. Lost my reading glasses yesterday. Jessie, c'mere. You verify new submissions for now. Rest of ya, if the police rings us again, we're gonna hafta tell somebody inclined to do somethin'."</p>

<p>"Like Mario!" A Big Bertha chirped.</p>

<p>"He normally stomps turtles, not phantoms." The bob-omb buddy editor got some weird glances from some koopas working there, including Kylie, but they were right.</p>

<p>The green plumber lingered at the Mushroom Press's front door observing that with unease. After Steve, a bullet bill with a graying mustache, removed another slew of false clues from the board he shimmied past, Luigi pressed on. Reporters were pacing around, going in and out of a back door where the vans were parked, or for Jessie, strung out totally, like a tweester hit her desk.</p>

<p>"Hi, I know it's a bad time but what's the news with the truck?"</p>

<p>Kylie collapsed into her chair with a sigh. The plumber's stomach churned. "Nah, they escaped the kingdom. It gets worse. If we go with the theory that some Bowser-affiliated faction staged this all, there must be a cover-up going on. Something's killing em off. The police inspector just found three more bodies-"</p>

<p>Boo vanished behind the plumber, so quickly that he felt the wind flap his pant legs. From faaaaar way, Boo's voice was heard squeaking that 'they couldn't take it. They'd be back later'.</p>

<p>"I can't see a denizen going that far, even if baddie hating, and yet.. I can't see Bowser's minions going civil war either. Something far uglier is happening. I don't know. A compound attack? Strike our folks with pestilence, and wipe out Bowser's with whatever they're doing."</p>

<p>"Oh.." Kylie spun towards her screen again. "So that's why we're calling our perp 'Phantom', others saying 'Incarnate Killer', whatever ya wanna use. There's not a scratch on the bodies less you count the bruise from em hitting the ground dead.. Wanna check it out?"</p>

<p>The grizzly scenes were difficult to look at, often two sets from each victim, though with close time stamps. One was from Chief Inspector Douglas of the Snifit Patrol, grainy from an older camera (thanking his new skills), but proficiently done, and the other set courtesy of the new photographer Susie Que, in HD resolution if misframed and farther back. Indeed, the koopas and goombas and such were simply dead in a puddle of blood from the mouth, nose, ears.. Grasping for some pattern, he analyzed the time stamps, comparing it with the location..</p>

<p>"..I'd almost hate to say this but I wish Bowser was around. He needs to know about this. Anyway, can we get an alert out? I think.." he trailed, afraid to voice his hypothesis.</p>

<p>"About that. Mitch could with his reader base but that's another thang I'm worried about," she admitted, closing the computer window. "He had a problem with Susie and might be out there feuding. I cornered old Jess, his girl kinda, and she's shut up like a clampy. I used an app that pinged his location East-ish of town."</p>

<p>Luigi snapped out of it. "Kylie..I must go."</p>

<p>He dashed out, rolling up his sleeves.</p><hr />

<p>After handling the two-minute repair job with ease, Mario exchanged his waterlogged boots for some spares. He wondered if Peach had replaced her soggy high heels. The idea of her prancing around in pastel fuzzy slippers entertained him while he laced a dry pair up. He unexpectedly found the slick wet mezzanine occupied by Toadsworth, propped at the front doors on lookout duty.</p>

<p>"Master Mario! Yes, come here for a moment, if you would be so kind."</p>

<p>"-Oh. Sure."</p>

<p>"We appreciate your selfless efforts as usual. You are a paragon Mushroom citizen, but I must caution you on a matter."</p>

<p>Mario listened apprehensively. "Mmhm?"</p>

<p>The old mushroom cast him an impish glance. "Just pulling your leg, old sport! I say, will you grow that out? Or is that 'grizzled 90s action hero' style what you are going for, Master Mario?"</p>

<p>A laugh escaped the bearded plumber. "Ah… not sure yet," he answered honestly. "Hey, we adjusted some things, so I'm running ahead of the rest. Keep everyone away from the slippery spots till I'm back."</p>

<p>Earlier he'd texted Bowser to prepare to meet him. He checked his watch, cleared out the stopwatch he forgot to before, and broke into a sprint. As he was tearing down the castle's grassy yard, he heard hushed voices. Over to the side, Peach had a mini bridge with a shallow stream underneath. Bending his head under, he found two young toads.</p>

<p>Toadette backed away from Bucken-Berry, waving and flushing. "We totally weren't goofing off or anything, hehe!"</p>

<p>"Oh that's fine.." Mario began to walk away.</p>

<p>"Mario, wait!" the blue toad began.</p>

<p>"Don't bring that up now." Toadette tugged on his dark blue vest.</p>

<p>"Sorry baby, I gotta. I don't mean this in a funny way but this is what Mr. Toad gets with his connections to bad guys."</p>

<p>"Diplomatically. Would you apply that to Princess Daisy too?" she fired back.</p>

<p>He shrugged. "I mean, we don't know her like that. Maybe. She has no KT history so it'd be Daisy's perigynous-"</p>

<p>"Prerogative?"</p>

<p>"That. -Unlike Mr. Toad, who's known the story of Princess Mush IV all his life. Her secret relationship with a koopa prince in 444 AD sunk an entire kingdom they say." He smirked at her little sigh of defeat. "See, I do pay attention in history class!"</p>

<p>She rolled her eyes. "Try the rest of them some time, Blue."</p>

<p>Mario backed up slowly. "Thanks for the heads up, Cool Blue. Lots to consider, ha ha. Talk to you later." He loosened up the collar around his neck a distance away, off of castle grounds.</p>

<p>When he made it to the city, he was getting close to Snifit Patrol's station. A whomp officer, Sergeant Howie, was waddling around the open garage doors, most of their vehicles missing.</p>

<p>Mario diverted to another block. There was an unwritten rule that none of the Mushroom Kingdom vigilantes stepped on each other's toes. Peach only trusted the him, Luigi, and a few toads so it just made everything awkward, even if the 'sanctioned' heroes could tell the others were just as capable and deferential to her and her empire. Too bad, he thought.</p><hr />

<p>Following the MKDCU intrusion, Mushroom Kingdom Hospital reached out for help. The automatic door was permanently stuck open and leaves and dirt were constantly being blown in. Doctor Professor Koopa succumbed to attrition, and so now they had some support coming from their sister hospital in Southern Mushroom Kingdom.</p>

<p>Nass T. returned to her desk, combing her long black hair down. She felt she appeared normal aside from the discolored oblong bruise on her wrist. She drearily reflected on how it got to this...</p>

<p>"Howdy, Mr. Probabilly Koopa here," greeted a mature koopa paratroopa in a blue janitor outfit. A gray ponytail reached his winged shell.</p>

<p>"We asked for security as well," the nurse stressed. "The MKDCU could return. Where is that?"</p>

<p>"Over yander. Rope-a-dopin' ostros is hard I reckon. Give it a bit." Unceremoniously he began tidying up the debris, trying not to laugh.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mario climbed into room 444, betting on the room still being empty and the window unrepaired. He rolled exceptionally well on both dice.</p>

<p>He peeked down the halls, noting shut doors, a few with banging from the other side. It was as bad as he thought. He'd slip on a white coat, pretend to be his cousin Dr. Mario, and borrow an ambulance out. He could pick up Bowser at home without suspicion and return with a grumpy, sharp-toothed surprise. He found a jacket that fit in a closet space with no issue. Now to gruff up his voice, lose the hat, find a rookie staff member and tell them-</p>

<p>Commotion startled the stethoscope out of his sweaty palms. Momma mia, he told Bowser to sit tight! Inching around a support column to spy into the lobby, the disturbance involved someone else near and dear.. Luigi had just slipped in a mad scramble to find someone, knocking down a stand of traveling pamphlets and ads. As the janitor helped his brother and apologized, Mario felt a wave of nausea, unable to move his feet. Nass's hand hovered over the intercom, but then she simply ducked under her desk. Probabilly laid down a wet floor sign and gestured for the brothers to scatter. The Marios dodged the approaching doctors, not saying a word until they hit a secluded alcove down the hall.</p>

<p>"Well," Mario folded the jacket over his arm. "You first."</p>

<p>Luigi yanked him forward by the shirt. "I'm trying to help with a murder case! The street signs and the date stamps and.. He was moving this way, killing KT folks I think!"</p>

<p>Mario gasped as his brother let go, leaning against the wall as he panted.</p>

<p>"I know it's hard to believe but.. Wait.. so why WERE you here? Where's the team?"</p>

<p>Mario dropped the white coat, mortified. "I'm here because I've been <em>dying inside</em> this entire time. That's why. I'm.. ready to tell you everything."</p>

<p>Luigi stood up straight, boring into him. "You're what?!"</p>

<p>
  <em>
    </em></p>

<p>
  <em>"Believe him. Or not. Just get outta here!"</em>
</p>

<p>
  <em><br />
</em>
</p>

<p>He checked over his shoulder, massaging his temple. This headache was getting out of contro-</p>

<p>
  <em>
    </em></p>

<p>
  <em>"-Go to the Toadley Clinic. Tell him the disease is so and so.."</em>
</p>

<p>
  <em><br />
</em>
</p>

<p>Mario stabilized him as his knees threatened to buckle and he felt his nose bleed. How was this.. the killer!</p>

<p>
  <em>
    </em></p>

<p>
  <em>"No. It's me not him. But go anyway. Just do it!"</em>
</p>

<p>
  <em><br />
</em>
</p>

<p>"Oww. Toadley Clinic. Just.. spill it to me there!" Luigi groaned, taking the initiative and snatching his arm.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Back up front, an older toad woman in a pink dress suit approached Nass after someone tipped her off. "-And you saw those brutish Mario brothers? Girlfriend, report them as Dr. Prof said."</p>

<p>"N-no. I was mistaken!" Nass replied. "The wind blew that junk over, but while you cover my break you can check on that security. I'm sure Theo would rent those cowboys a kart if it came to that."</p>

<p>"I dislike that MKDCU, girl."</p>

<p>"Me too, Mariam.."</p>

<p>As they spoke, the janitor paused his vigorous mopping. "Hmm. Yep, fits my brother's mo."</p>

<p>A few moments later, in walked a noki with sunglasses and a red Hawaiian shirt. He weaved around the wet floor signs and still drying bleach, picking up one of the travel brochures Luigi knocked over along the way.</p>

<p>"Visitation is suspended, dearie," Mariam informed him.</p>

<p>"I understand," he replied, flashing a nice smile as he held up a pamphlet. "Are there more of these somewhere? I am just a tourist from somewhere exotic."</p>

<p>"I see.." she murmured flirtatiously. "Ah hem. Down the hall to the left."</p>

<p>He shortly ignored the magazine rack, diverting as soon as he wasn't being watched to scan a directory of room numbers. Agent N's niece, Ashley might be here.</p>

<p>
  <em>
    </em></p>

<p>
  <em>"You won't save her if you don't visit me in room 26, Mr. Bond."</em>
</p>

<p>
  <em><br />
</em>
</p>

<p>The noki froze in his tracks, reaching to see if the earplugs were in place.</p>

<p>
  <em>
    </em></p>

<p>
  <em>"If you weren't so handsome, Jelectro, I'd call you stupid. Nice placebo. Never seen never seen a psychic use that."</em>
</p>

<p>
  <em><br />
</em>
</p>

<p>"No one asked you!..." The detective covered his mouth.</p>

<p>
  <em>
    </em></p>

<p>
  <em>"I'm kidding. They all do. They tend to grow out of it by your age tho. Just get to my room already."</em>
</p>

<p>
  <em><br />
</em>
</p>

<p>The noki put on a stoic face and dragged his feet for N's sake. In truth, he detected this energy since he'd arrived, and wished so heartily that he could avoid it until now. The figure he navigated to was a prosaic green-capped toad under covers. A bandage was on his face, the rest of the damage hidden though his monitors indicated a sluggish heart rate and strained breathing.</p>

<p>
  <em></em>
</p>

<p>
  <em>"Sorry to disappoint! Heh heh,"</em>
</p>

<p>the toad communicated without looking or moving his mouth. <em>"Was Sirena Beach as overcrowded as I remember, French Boy? Aw, never mind. Here's a short version of a long story. I can't jabber or Theo will kill me, but if I do nothing they'll get killed by 'Phantom' and everybody sick here might be shipped off."</em></p>

<p>Jelectro abruptly took his side. "What needs to happen?"</p>

<p>
  <em></em>
</p>

<p>
  <em>"You ward 'Phantom' off. Right nickname for the wrong reason. He's a 22 yr old biopsychokinesis user. Killed a bus driver so he'd grind me to paste. Super creative at times. I'd love to mentor one like that if not for the psycho part and the attaching himself to.. I'm getting off topic. Watch out also for Theo, or Dr. Prof. Koopa. He's catching onto.."</em>
</p>

<p>His body stirred ever so slightly. <em>"Friggin.. 'Phantom' is already close. He'll finish me off then kill a bunch of other people that he THINKS can rat him out. I'll send over details about everything, including my research material at the office. Don't tell Kylie I'm on the mends. Ready dude? Go!-"</em></p>

<p>With a grunt the agent stumbled backwards, like Bowser bomb went off in his skull. He tripped over a recliner in the room, and bounced out into the hallway. Disorientation kept him there until someone offered a hand to the noki, dripping red onto the white tiles. He rose on his own, handkerchief pressed to his nose. The time had come.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>"No exception to the visitation restrictions I'm afraid," the nurse told the dark boo, forcing a smile.</p>

<p>The dark boo snatched her lanyard, snarling, "Listen bro, you're gonna tell me which room my 'pal' is in!"</p>

<p>"Yes..I..will..tell..you…" she replied robotically.</p>

<p>Jelectro caught up. "There you are, mon ami!" He wedged himself between the dark boo and the nurse, severing their eye contact. "Don't you recognize me.. 'Zoo Diddley'? Hm?" The noki briskly flashed his Super Spy HQ badge so that only Zoo could see it. "Let us converse as we depart, oui?"</p>

<p>Seething, Zoo allowed himself to be dragged outside by the detective, lasting about as long as the noki knew it would. He jumped on the bike illegally parked on the sidewalk, tossing a thick heavy bundle of newspapers in the noki's face. He was flattened by the stack momentarily.</p>

<p>"It's on the house, Bond!" Zoo teased. "I can always come back. Not like this guy's going anywhere soon."</p>

<p>The detective rolled away from the dense obstacle, slid his sunglasses up, and gave chase from his sports car. He reached for the anti-boo gas, intending to tie a rubberband on it and toss it like a grenade. He found the canister empty to his immense disappointment, as he'd used it up that last time he fought off rival Agent M.</p><hr />

<p>"Princess, for the fourth time, Master Mario said he will be back! You aren't thinking of traveling without his protection are you? There have been additional homicides now!"</p>

<p>The toads listening in behind closed doors recoiled, particularly Toadette. Yoshi had just reentered, needing to step outside to get a signal to call Birdo. Peach Castle was a dead zone for 4G, something about the concrete.. His fiancé was patient upon learning how things kept escalating, but he still detected frustration in her tone when he confirmed, carefully wording it, that he intended to stay the rest of the day. She'd understand later.</p>

<p>"-But Toadsworth dear, I saw where Mario fixed the problem with the pipes. He only needed tape so it should not take this long!" The pink princess huffed. "Toad and Daisy must be at the Toadley Clinic and- I'm just trapped in my own home!"</p>

<p>"-Stars in heaven! So no hope of recovery soon? ..Do not give me that petulant look, Princess. I feared you were censoring yourself to spare us the most severe details. Well, do not do that!"</p>

<p>"I am sorry.." she groused.</p>

<p>"Regardless, I will allow it," he continued warmly. He rang a bell. "All we need is a chauffeur for you, Princess. My sincere apologies, Master Yoshi, but there are regulations on who may transport our princess."</p>

<p>The dinosaur so clearly had an issue with that, but he respected the old toad. Being four years younger was apparently enough to humiliate him thoroughly in their 40-plus age-only rugby matches...</p>

<p>"Ah hem!... Yes, thank you Bucken-Berry, but you do not have a license. Tut tut. Since you are present you may take down the banners for Mr. Toad."</p>

<p>"About time," Bucken-Berry said, making Toadette leave his side and groan.</p>

<p>"Mr. Toadsworth, I completed the chores. Please, let me take them again."</p><hr />

<p>"Welcome, do you have an appointment?" the receptionist asked right away, a younger toad woman with blonde medium length hair.</p>

<p>Luigi and Mario approached the desk. They hadn't spoken on the way there, which made the hitchhiking they did with a random fan of Mario's somewhat tense, likely being blogged about on those messageboards by fans right then.</p>

<p>"-No we don't. It's me, Mario. Tell him that."</p>

<p>The intern pressed a buzzer. "Doctor, I'm sending some in without an appointment. They're famous."</p>

<p>"Am I ready? No I am not!" A voice boomed from behind large double doors walling off the waiting area from the rest of the Toadley Clinic.</p>

<p>The duo were permitted through and into Dr. Toadley's lab, a dimly lit larger room partitioned into two halves. One side had beds with five patents in them. They recognized Toad and Daisy spontaneously, tinted green as before, but also connected to proper-looking equipment. Luigi felt faint, the mysterious voice true, and would have hit the floor if there weren't so many bookshelves to hang on to.</p>

<p>"Am I working day and night to find out what is wrong with my patients here? Yes I am. Reluctantly, can I answer anything else? Yes I can." Toadley asked impatiently. The doctor dressed in purple remained at his table, surrounded by shelves of various herbs and powders.</p>

<p>Luigi stepped forward. "I can help with that. It's the Mushroom Flu."</p>

<p>The planet stopped spinning for the red plumber. "..Luigi, they can't! That only ever broke out in Dark Land!"</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p>"Brilliant! Did I suspect such? Yes I did!" Dr. Toadley exclaimed, animated as he jumped onto his laptop with research.</p>

<p>Over his mad clacking of keys, Mario pulled his brother aside. "L-Luigi. Let me handle this call.."</p>

<p>Numbly Luigi obeyed, unable to discern what implications Mario saw in that that he didn't. A dry bones was at the desk while Toadley's intern shielded herself with a clipboard. "I said, no! We're not hiring, Phil!"</p>

<p>"Yo, but imma chemist. Got connections with Reggie J. business bro. He runs Fungus Up."</p>

<p>"That's been discontinued. For years."</p>

<p>"Fo real? I saw people drankin em though today. Specially edition, with the personalized names written on em? Like straight outta some nerd's collection-"</p>

<p>"Go away please!"</p>

<p>As the hip, backward hat wearing baddie slinked out, the next the line came up, a boo diddly.</p>

<p>"Umm. I'm not a bad guy. I.. uh.. Mario's fan club were saying.."</p>

<p>"Boo!" Luigi ran out to meet them, the two colliding in a hug.</p>

<p>"Weegee." the boo sobbed over his shoulder. "I'm terrible at this and I'm sorry."</p>

<p>Luigi held steady. No he was he supposed. A little later he took in some fresh air outside the clinic, the scorching heat lessened by a haze in the sky. He should have warned that guy of the Phantom, neither Mushroomite nor Darklandian, putatively sophisticated, maybe even attractive or at least magnetic in some way, and either floating or flying. Maybe had a P-Wing too, or some other innate way to leave the crime scenes on the dime.</p>

<p>Caught up in the moment, doing the same 'ousting bad guy' job he'd been doing for decades, to warn that baddie didn't cross his mind. Now his blood might be on his hands.</p>

<p>Well dry bones didn't bleed but-</p><hr />

<p>A silver Aston Mushroom had no choice but to return to the Mushroom Press, his mark sinking underground on him, into a realm only boos could access. Walking in, the noki had a foolproof idea on how to access the items of Mitch Jamerson Toad, 'The Kingdom Enquirer' author, aged forty-one, technically 'single', living in a complex around Pleasant Path.. He kept reciting those facts, just in case he was quizzed, though the place was too deserted for that. Jelectro found the cubicle with the 'Mitch Toad' gold plate. Before he dove in, a koopa blocked him.</p>

<p>"What's up sir? This stuff over here's private, alright?" Kylie told him, crossing her arms.</p>

<p>"Ah, but I am Mitch's intern, mon ami. He was involuntarily relocated and needs me to retrieve his items. If I may.." He tried to ease around the unbudging reporter.</p>

<p>"No offense sir, but I know 'em a little too well to believe that. You only got this far because half the office went home early."</p>

<p>"On this busy day, madam?" He effortlessly unlocked one of his cabinets.</p>

<p>She started blankly before rubbing the back of her neck tiredly. "Maybe you do work with that ol Mitch. Gee whiz!"</p>

<p>"Why is this building empty?" Jelectro reiterated, locating a folder titled 'Stars' and then 'Chimes'.</p>

<p>"Paranoid they'll be mistaken for a 'Bowser Freak'. Since you're an associate I guess, I can tell you that I'm still working on the tennis game investigation. Me, Steve, Susie-"</p>

<p>Behind his dark sunglasses, the noki's beady eyes darkened. "Avoid that one."</p>

<p>"Sounds like a Mitch partner."</p>

<p>"I am serious, madame. Besides, that is my topic as well! I know what they are sick with." He revealed the answer under his breath.</p>

<p>Kylie nearly flipped out of her shell. "Get whatever ya need. We gotta tell the Princess!"</p><hr />

<p>The Great Eldstar, high above in his great and awe-inspiring temple, had transformed into a 'couch' or 'throne potato' as they said, lethargy making it insurmountable to leave. When he did, he got nowhere, or found himself where he started. 'Simplify the layout', his celestial companions begged. 'Few of us take residence here.' Never!</p>

<p>Star Temple had been sculped before the strands of time were woven by the Lord he appointed. How dare he alter it simply because a haze was settling in its upper chambers. There were many potential sources for such in space, and the problem could be rectified if he found it. The Great Star continued to wander...</p>

	<p>The sharp ticks of the wall clock rattled Luigi's soul as he waited for this brother's call to be over.</p>

<p>"Over here. Just a sec." He cut off Mario from leaving the lab. He shut them inside what he thought was another hallway but was a storage room housing bird feed, bags of stardust, and other supplies. He left the door open a sliver then, a little light bleeding in. "I could start with the photographs and Kylie and the way we pieced together this demented scheme, but none of that really matters right now does it? You were lying to protect Bowser," he declared. "Why?"</p>

<p>Mario inhaled deeply. "I knew that Bowser wouldn't stomp all over the pact in a deliberate attack, and I was so determined to protect him I had blinders on. I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"I get that! Now answer the question, Mario!" Luigi yelled, his gestures bumping a jangly box of test tubes.</p>

<p>"I-I did didn't I?"</p>

<p>Luigi spun on his heels.</p>

<p>"Fine- fine wait!" Mario dove for the door handle. A struggle ensued. "You really.. wanna know why.. I like him? ..It's because I can be myself.." he grunted. "He's not a bad guy. Don't forget that he went against his entire board and had commentators eat him alive to accept our treaties. He doesn't care what other people think and I like that. Sometimes.. I wish I could be like that."</p>

<p>"Mario!?"</p>

<p>"-It's not that I cared more about him than our friends or you or the kingdom. I just couldn't have us regress to where we were before, not when I wanted to retire!"</p>

<p>Luigi gave up the fight, the diety-like image of 'Mario' disintegrating. No, it would have been a lesser betrayal if his brother pulled out a fire flower and shot him in the face. "Don't YOU remember your vow?!"</p>

<p>"Yes. I was going to protect everyone.. as long as they needed a hero like that, Luigi! Letting this go on past its expiration date made people complacent. I appreciate the support from my fans but it wasn't supposed to turn into a cult that assumes I'm brainwashed by something called 'Nintendo' when I make a decision they hate- Aka like that car in Mario Party briefly. And all the mainstream media is so wrapped up in kingdom rivalries that they haven't noticed that Peach and Bowser don't have to fight. I'll be blunt, the pact wasn't just to free myself up, everybody needed that reset, and it could have worked if the Mushroom Flu didn't happen!"</p>

<p>Luigi had to relent a little. Eons ago when war ignited between the Mushroom and Koopa empires, they were half and half occupying the vast territories of the 'Mushroom' World as later coined. With six independent kingdoms between the ancient lands now, the goals of both were a vagary.</p>

<p>"Mario. Your logic is sound on some of that but...So.. why couldn't you tell me this before?" he muttered.</p>

<p>Mario faced the opposite corner, shadows shrouding his guilt-ridden form. "I wasn't scared of the fan club I realize. Those strangers hardly crossed my mind in fact. I didn't want to disappoint you. ..I've always been afraid of that most really."</p>

<p>Luigi dragged his gaze over to his brother. Somehow, Mario appeared worse, more flushed, eyes not merely glistening but running. "Warping here changed our trajectory a lot, didn't it?"</p>

<p>"In some ways," Mario trailed vaguely. "Again. I'm sorry."</p>

<p>Luigi eased him into a hug, quickly becoming a tight, cathartic squeeze. Neither could afford to wallow with precious time ebbing away, so shortly the intern saw them somewhat stoically return from wherever they'd gone, asking if bringing in a few more without an appointment would annoy Toadley too much. Mary wished for the stars to bless them both.</p><hr />

<p>Toadsworth yawned at the castle entrance, eyelids growing heavy as a white haze obscured the sun. The chancellor snapped awake, straightening his posture and accepted defeat, ringing a gold bell. There was a chronic deficit of labor on weekends, Peach refusing to task too many to clean up her home all day when they could be 'out there, enjoying life' in her words.</p>

<p>Toadsworth almost scoffed at the thought. As if there was more to a Mushroomite's life than serving their princess.</p>

<p>Someone tossed away the bucket and gloves, approaching from outdoors. "I'm free, Mr. Toadsworth brah."</p>

<p>The elder nodded at the dependable golden-yellow toad, tanned and taller than most. "Thank you. I will return after a brief recess."</p>

<p>Using wifi Ala-Gold messaged another staffer. A shorter, more muscular blue toad soon raced down the steps. Having an identical track record for accompanying the Mario bros to fight the Koopa Troop or 'Bowser's Minions' or whatever they wanted to call themselves now in wars long past, they gave each other their secret handshake and laughed.</p>

<p>Later Ala-Gold leaned lazily against the castle's white outside walls. "Love working outside with Joe usually, but he's off lately. Giving the silent hands treatment."</p>

<p>Bucken-Berry sat on the bridge's edge, feet dangling down. "Must be pregnant."</p>

<p>"What? Ha ha.. One thing about fungi thou.."</p>

<p>"I'm joking Gold, don't get sciencey on me."</p>

<p>"Ah, yeah brah.." The gold toad deflated a little bit. "I missed a boatload of stuff today. Why did we toss all of our soda?"</p>

<p>"MK East released one update and it's that the diseases came from a drink. Fungus Up was spotted at the game but Mr. Toadsworth said we should trash all the 'rubbish' just in case. Then there's a serial killer out there. I was thinking about hunting Phantom down myself. Mean, if he's gonna kill baddies he doesn't need to paint our sidewalks red to do it. I have this grappling technique now and.." he went on, in excruciating detail..</p>

<p>"-Whatta bout Mr. Toad?"</p>

<p>He could faintly see heat radiate as Bucken-Berry stared straight ahead. "..Look, I don't want him to die or anything, but he's freaking overrated. Why the googly eyes? He doesn't adventure anymore. He goes on too many business trips to Neo Bowser City, which-" He cleared his throat. "Is where the soda vendor came from they say. I don't even think he likes other toads!"</p>

<p>"Don't say that!"</p>

<p>"He's never dated anyone publically and he's royalty. It's unnatural."</p>

<p>"...Brah our princess has never dated besides that fake thing with Mario we all see through."</p>

<p>The blue toad laughed cruelly. "Whatever, man. Royals are weird."</p>

<p>Actually sorta agreeing with that, yellow toad dropped that argument. They had a visitor walking towards the castle, a red toad. The stranger's exposed skin was marred with old abrasions and holes in his shoes were visible from a mile away.</p>

<p>"Greetings. I have arrived at Princess Peach Toadstool's request for additional servants." The toad held a withered pink invitation they recognized- if five years out of date.</p>

<p>Ala-Gold approached cautiously. "Nobody said nuthin bout interviews, but-"</p>

<p>"-But, get over here!" Bucken-Berry commanded.</p>

<p>The stranger scurried closer. "Hi, I'm Thomas." He held out his hand and received an awkward shake from both. "So, I can do whatever Princess Peach Toadstool needs and I'm ready to start now."</p>

<p>"-You sound funny, man. I can hardly understand you!"</p>

<p>Bucken-Berry shook his head exasperatedly. "Listen better, Gold. This 'Thomas' has a foreign kingdom accent, like yours except.. He sounds Darklandian!" The kid yelped as Bucken-Berry twisted his wrist around. "-Ah ha, a Koopa Troop tattoo!" He seized him then, lifting him over his head.</p>

<p>"Chill out!" Ala-Gold repeated as Toadsworth and two others, the cook in an apron and a banker with crumbs in his mustache, shuffled outside and onto the bridge.</p>

<p>"Are you having a row? Cease that, I say!" Toadsworth barged between them. "What is the matter?"</p>

<p>Bucken-Berry dropped the minuscule toad. "A cretin from Dark Land wanted to say hi."</p>

<p>"-N-no, I don't know rotten Bowser! The tattoo was to get past a checkpoint and I was already running away- t-then.. there was a caravan traveling south and.. I saw an opportunity and took it. I promise!" Thomas dropped to his scarred knees before the elder. " I only survived this long because I moved up to Mayor Koton's office in Neo Bowser City. Almost every civilian has to work for a warlord. Please!"</p>

<p>Toadsworth's scowl faded. "Goodness… You are a Dark Land citizen? Oh, you were kidnapped rather. When?.. Too painful to remember?.. I won't distress you further. We shall see how your onboarding unfolds."</p>

<p>He anticipated Chef Tim making a face. He had a bigger head than usual now that his famous mother Zess T. had a tv network. Mr. Zeror the financier in turn watched expectantly, the thirtish green toad begging for more on the payroll 'because logistically they'd save coins over a period of etc etc..' Toads and humans from allied kingdoms were the exemplary servants of the royal Toadstool line. Neutral kingdoms, territories, and of course other species were qualifiable too, only subject to more thorough checks. Since the Peace Pact, Dark Land was pointedly in the latter category and there was nothing the chancellor could do about it. Not when he signed the documents himself.</p>

<p>Despite the mixed reception, Thomas bounced back to his feet. "Thank you thank you thank you!"</p>

<p>"You are welcome," Toadsworth concluded, tapping the cane.</p>

<p>Bucken-Berry pinched between his dark eyebrows. "No friggin WAY I just heard that. Excuse the language, Mr. Toadsworth, but since when do we just take in any runt off the street?! We live in a castle, not a halfway house!"</p>

<p>"We've never had these circumstances either," the elder replied tersely. "Until the Princess returns, there is no obligation or desire to repel our guest. Now Thomas, who would you prefer as chaperone?"</p>

<p>Thomas studied them acutely. "..Yeah, that one. Thank you again, Mr. Toadswell."</p>

<p>"-Ah-hem, <em>Toadsworth</em>. Much appreciated volunteer spirit, Ala-Gold. I will return with refreshments for you both. Tally ho!" And they went back indoors.</p>

<p>Bucken-Berry leaned into his friend's ear, otherwise trying to say out of it. "Have fun.." he said, brushing past his shoulder. At times like this Gold was sure Mario nicknamed his buddy 'Cool Blue' to be ironic and the entire thing flew over his head.</p>

<p>Once the coast was clear, Thomas dove onto the trimmed green grass, combing the blades between his fingers. "Can't believe it's real!" He rolled onto his back. "And a blue-ish sky. Oh my God!"</p>

<p>"Who? And how old are you, bruh?"</p>

<p>"Just an expression. I'm Seventeen."</p>

<p>Ala-Gold asked if he wanted to witness the 'opulence' of the castle. Thomas refused. The gold toad watched him skip around and play in the yard before stepping up on him. "Hey, this job is super serious, brah. You ain't hiding nothing, right?"</p>

<p>Thomas landed from an acrobatic leap. "Of course not."</p>

<p><em>"~Lemon lemon lemon lemon, let me see ya lemon pop that body.."</em> was some video from MKTV, the pseudo music station, not to be confused with the Mario Kart TV channel, which was a common customer complaint. Either way, Bowser didn't mean to cut that thing on. He must have stepped on the remote in the confusion of trying to find some disguise to wear.</p>

<p>After tripping over a stack of 200lb weights, he flopped into the Mario Bro's bedroom. How impressive it was if Mario was deadlifting that stuff was a random intrusive thought of his while rummaging around. Inside were two made-up red and green beds with a black dresser in between. Two wooden drawers are what he targeted, flinging about shirts and overalls until he reached the lowest one on Mario's side. A robe was folded around an old album. One photo slipped out featuring someone, face obscured, cradling Bowser Junior, a helpless baby koopa belonging to a newly widowed father.</p>

<p>~Bowser Junior was 'Junior' because Queen Clawdia didn't get a chance to settle on one name for him. When Bowser was asked, he stated 'Junior', giving the eighth and final child his name as commonly believed. After the funeral, a stealthy robed figure crept up, evading his guards. The 'magikoopa' reached out and held his arm first, pulling it into an embrace. Opening his crusted-over eyes, he recognized the stranger illegally there, but he didn't resist. He still thought about their words of encouragement to this day.~</p>

<p>Back in reality, Bowser stopped kneeling, clearing up his runny nose. "Stupid Mario you.. Why do you still have that?" He shoved the items back where they were. Grabbing a bed sheet, he'd leave this joint without any style. He was desperate.</p><hr />

<p>"-No not hang OUT at the mall together, just we both hang at the Mushroom Mall, uh.. at the same time coincidentally?"</p>

<p>"Thanks, maybe later Em," replied the handsome Boom Boom about three years Emery's senior. She had a cute face to him, super smooth with the pickup lines too, but he'd been dodging her crush forever. Workmate romances were like untamed chain chomps. Get touchy and get mauled. Dave then tossed his army jacket off and onto the coat rack, done with flying helicopters for the day.</p>

<p>Tail between her legs, Emery T. retreated to her workstation on the opposite side of the landing pad when her personal phone rang.</p>

<p>"-Hey, Fangirl… No, just allergies. So how ya doing? ..Good. I know it's crazy but I need a hand. Could ya send a wagon over for an 'emergency' at so and so?"</p>

<p>"Whatever you say, King. I'm on it. I'm surprised someone didn't come up with the Trojan ambulance thing earlier." Emery caught up with the boom boom at the timekeeping terminal.</p>

<p>"Dave, I got one more call!"</p>

<p>"Let the next shift get it." He winked, walking off.</p>

<p>Doctor Professor Koopa waited at the stairs, appearing out of nowhere. "Miss Emery? Report to my office please."</p>

<p>Emery followed him down into his office. Doctor Professor closed the heavy door behind her and then took a seat at his desk. Every time she was sent here the thick dusty books in old languages and shelves filled with barbaric medical equipment, fit for a dungeon, freaked her out more.</p>

<p>"Do you know Sebastian Bullet?"</p>

<p>"Sir? I- in the past I guess."</p>

<p>Satisfied, Doctor Professor clasped his hands. "You are a smart girl. You know unscrupulous service reports, such as those courtesy of Mr. Bullet and his 'MKDCU', harm this facility greatly. If only we could determine who incited them.."</p>

<p>Turning into stone, she sputtered, "Check with my mom?"</p>

<p>Doctor Professor leaned closer, adopting a challenging glare. "Why would a nice girl like you want to worry your mother when this is between us? Could those cellular doohickeys hold a clue? -Like the ones we've caught you on all day?"</p>

<p>She blushed. "Sir, I'm sorry!"</p>

<p>He opened a manila folder, containing perfectly intact original documents for the MKDCU's patient discharge. Emery was unquestionably the nurse that had signed it off. "Not enough. You are fired."</p>

<p>Her termination did not register for a moment, as she was certain, as certain as Peach hating Bowser, that she had burnt those papers hours ago and scattered the ashes from the roof.</p><hr />

<p>Peach's shimmering lake awed the young toad. It was ages since he'd seen any large body of liquid that wasn't lava. Like a mirror, it reflected the sky, the vibrant pink roof of the castle, and his rather scrawny self. Every other toad he'd encountered, even old Chancellor whatchamacallit, was bigger and or more filled out. That might be a problem..</p>

<p>He took the last slip of the herb tea, keeping the ceramic cup in his paws while listening to the golden island toad. Apparently he got hired when his only previous experience was at a Ricco Harbor inn. Thomas learned about if Mario lived at the castle, and why not, if Princess Toadstool still had family around, how life was in Toad Town, the coin conversion rate, and the hardest one yet, if everyone was nice here..</p>

<p>Ala-Gold didn't answer, standing from the bank. "-Giving ya a crash course is fun and all, but I gotta ask, what do you know?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"At all brah? No offense but unless you're from Vortex Island, you should know this stuff."</p>

<p>Thomas dropped his cup, backing from the broken pieces. "I am! Or near enough."</p>

<p>He looked at the teen sternly, draining the frivolousness out of him. "...Don't mess with me. Okay? I'm being super nice, brah don't make me regret it."</p>

<p>"Yes sir. So.. my intentions were-"</p>

<p>Both were drowned out by a loud engine, unusual when the raceway was closed.</p>

<p>Snifit Patrol's spacey hover car dropped off a dark boo in an orange ball cap on the edge of Peach's lawn. The snufit knew of 'Susie' via his chief inspector, and picked the photographer up to get a read on him. Drove em to Tayce T's. Got some donuts. Chatted him up. Unfortunately 'Sue' wasn't that dumb and he had to let him go here, the princess feeling that flashing blue lights might 'incite panic'. The snufit would adjust his patrolling route and sweep by in fifteen minutes. Not much should happen until then.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the dark boo's jagged sharp teeth were on display, smiling. "Just investigating! If there's a Bowser person round here, it's not safe you know.."</p>

<p>After motioning for Thomas to go inside, the yellow toad ran up to hold him off in the middle of the uphill slope to the castle. They had a strained relationship with the Press so he'd better be the best PR he could be without Kinopio-Kun around. "They call me Ala-Gold brah. Steward here. The princess is, ah, busy and stuff.." trailed, finding his words. "Anyway nobody from Bowser's army's here."</p>

<p>The boo produced a laminated card, 'Zoo Sue Diddley's' identification. In 2D the dark boo lacked that bottomless pit quality of his dark instead of yellow as typical eyes, but on the real him the ex-sailer wasn't a fan of that and had to avoid too much eye contact.</p>

<p>"Alright. I see it, brah," he said quietly.</p>

<p>"Good. We gotta be sure. You don't judge a book by its cover do ya? Even someone who looks just. Like. You." He poked the gold toad's toned abs with each syllable. "Could be <em>dying</em> to work for King Koopa. I'll be quick. I have powers bro. I can talk to animals. Want to see, Wolley?"</p>

<p>Zoo pointed over to a flutter, one of many that frequented Peach's garden.</p>

<p>Ala-Gold was hit with a wave of dizziness, throwing him to his knees, shaking as static noises made his ears want to bleed.</p>

<p><em>... ... ... 'That filthy Lemon Pop music video...'</em> the Flutter was speaking in between chomps of leaves.</p>

<p><em>...'Yeah, did you see how those Dino Rhinos were shaking their rumps? Why am I paying for content like that?'</em> the Fighter Fly replied, collecting pollen as a busy father of a recent clutch of twenty-five eggs. <em>'Why yesterday they had the Pianta Village People lip-syncing while in those costumes...'</em></p>

<p>Unable to take it, the golden toad vomited into the lawn, utterly paralyzed, like an anchor was tied to his back. Actually, back on his island people like Zoo were liable to get bound to one of those and hurled into the sea. Cruel, but local legend said that was the cure to whatever a Black Chest did to you. Ethics were moot at the moment anyway. The press boy had rendered him hyperventilating and useless without a single touch.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Thomas leaned on his tiptoes, unable to check the peephole. "Mr. Toadsworks, there's a-"</p>

<p>"I have it!" Toadsworth descended from upstairs briskly. "And it's Chancellor- Never mind." He chuckled wryly as he answered the door. "Oh, a representative of the Press are you? Due to our circumstances there is no visitation, thank you."</p>

<p>Zoo phased through the closed door, causing Thomas to flee into the closest inner room. "Rude bastard.. Where's he at!?"</p>

<p>Toadsworth jabbed his stick into the floor, holding his ground. "This is Peach Castle innit? Look elsewhere for 'he' and be warned, belonging to that meddlesome Press downtown, and not on the good side of it, does not afford you impunity to trespass! This will teach you-"</p>

<p>With a ferocious growl, Zoo teleported right on him and snatched the weighty bell out of his grasp. "Typical Toady. Embolded long as you know someone else'll fight your battles."</p>

<p>A bead of sweat rolled off the old toad's forehead. "Oh, I suppose you got me!.. May I have that back?" he ventured as benignly as possible. "It's.. quite an antique."</p>

<p>"Yes good sir, as an antique collector myself, you may! Catch." Zoo bashed him in the forehead with it. Toadsworth collapsed, his pince-nez cracking as his face smacked the checker-tiled floor…</p>

<p>Sounds of a distant, nasty scuffle sped Thomas up. After crossing by the Wet-Dry World painting twice, he accepted that the map he'd memorized was more outdated than his recruitment pamphlet. He rounded another corner, towards the nearest fire ax in a glass casing. Smashing it with his callused fist, he had a chance to assist Toadsworth, he got it right that time, if the weapon's mass didn't have him swaying all over the hallways, through a star marked door and into another servant-</p>

<p>The tray of clean plates and cups Bucken-Berry carried crashed everywhere. "What the?!- It's you again, you little... What are you doing with that, psycho!?"</p>

<p>"No! I wasn't gonna- There's a guy up there and-!"</p>

<p>"Shut up, kid." Bucken-Berry pinched Thomas's lips closed as some ringing became clear. "That's Mr. Toadsworth calling for something." The blue toad piled the broken china into a corner with his foot. "Gimme that ax. Now, MARCH kid!"</p>

<p>He forced Thomas down a long brick hallway to the front where they joined all of the other toads working today in the lobby, no one having a clue what was going on until Bucken-Berry in particular noticed a shadow blending in with the busy floor pattern. He tilted his head upwards and cries rippled through the crowd soon after. Their chancellor was suspended by his vest on the high glass chandelier, pale and limp like a doll discarded by a bored child. A line of blood ran from his bruised temple.</p>

<p>Zoo materialized above the sun pattern rug in the center. He tossed aside Toadsworth's bell, marred by dry blood. "I don't do monologues, so listen the first time. Someone here works for Bowser. Which?"</p>

<p>"It's a hobo or druggy," Chef Tim remarked snidely. "He's lost either way."</p>

<p>Zoo adjusted his cap. "Really? This is the 350 year old Peach Castle on 64 Royal Lane, inherited by Princess Peach Toadstool from her dad eighteen years ago. Hm what else? Oh, you brats. It's staffed by chancellor 'Samuel' Toadsworth, Earl Mr. Toad K. Toad, junior manager Toadette Kinopiko, steward 'Wolley' Ala-Gold, even dumber steward 'Yvan' Bucken-Berry, banker Mr. Zeror, tour guide Lester P. Toad, Chef Timothy- whose cooking sucks, gardener Joseph T., and PR/correspondent Lionel Kinopio-"</p>

<p>"-How did he do that? Someone call Mario!" the chef bellowed.</p>

<p>"Does he respond to this too? Nobodies gonna help you, hahaha.." Zoo rang a bell from his reporter's bag, though it was not Toadsworth's as he intended, but another antique from his bag, another bell so worn it created a dull thud with each jostle.</p>

<p>Bucken-Berry shook himself out of that stupor and charged the distracted boo. He rammed Zoo into the nearest wall with a thunk that shook the damp furniture in the lobby. Amongst the rain of paint chips, Zoo faded away and reappeared behind him, slapping the blue toad into the bricks. Dazed with spots in his vision, he threw out a few punches, some connecting. Zoo evened it up by going intangible, phasing both through the wall and outdoors.</p>

<p>A purple toad, Les lumbered over to the ax, picking it up while fixated on the wispy smoke lingering in that corner. "They gotta be in the drink. No time to call for help. It's on us now, 'aight?"</p>

<p>A long-sleeved lime green toad went to Les's podium and began to operate the clunky rotary phone anyway.</p>

<p>"Kinopio, you little... Never mind that spoilsport. Tim, use your pan to beat his brains. Joe, your pruning shears will do. Everyone else improvise, including the new guy. This your first day? Name?"</p>

<p>Thomas discovered that hiding behind one of Peach's house plants didn't work. "M-my n-name is.."</p>

<p>"-And why do you sound Darklandian?"</p>

<p>Outside, Bucken-Berry peddled around in the deep blue lake. He was inches from the surface when a debilitatingly painful sensation stuck him, a burn all over worse than one hundred angry suns. At the shore Zoo blasted a psionic beam from his fingertips, giggling as he sunk like a rock. That was when something with the speed of K64 running late tackled him from his blind side. Both bodies rolled around on the lakeshore. Getting the leg up, this person slammed the dark boo on rocky soil, chipping a tooth.</p>

<p>"It's rude to eavesdrop, brah. Keep it to yourself next time." Ala-Gold punched him again for one good measure as others burst outside, following the commotion. They carried whatever dangerous object they could, including pieces that would get them yelled at later, like expensive vases and everyone's favorite garden gnome.</p>

<p>"Ugh, these guys," Zoo snarled. "Since I'm half toad I can say this. You can live in a castle and not be free, bro. You're slaves."</p>

<p>Seemingly on cue, the castle began to rumble from the foundation, wave after wave of telekinetic forces causing bricks to crack and pink roof tiles to detach. The windows warped and wobbled before shattering, shards spraying over the yard. Thousands- no millions of coins worth of damage happening before their eyes! Too bad for their intruder, that already happened this morning, making them numb to it.</p>

<p>Ala-Gold pulled Zoo up. "What a troll. We work here cause we wanna. Now stop this."</p>

<p>"I ain't doing it!"</p>

<p>"Huh? Bounce!"</p>

<p>By then the staff circled around, jittery yet steadfast with their makeshift arms. Breathing heavily from the ordeal and his anger alike, Bucken-Berry emerged from the lake, a cough punctuating each stomp. The water on his skin and clothing began to sizzle.</p>

<p>"Friggin kill him!" he managed.</p>

<p>"NO BRAH!"</p>

<p>"N-no?" Bucken-Berry got held away by the gold toad, never hearing him yell like that before.</p>

<p>"No? Hmm.." Zoo leaned up, intrigued.</p>

<p>Ala-Gold supposed he deserved to be looked at like a weirdo for once, and trying to hold the blue toad back was getting dangerous, but so was letting somebody die on castle grounds, an anathema. He didn't know why nor needed to. As some skeletal-looking sailors on a rusty ship told him once, the urge 'know too much' was part of the trap.</p>

<p>Jolting him from those thoughts, Bucken-Berry pushed away from his grasp. "-Actually, yeah Gold's right. New kid should see this. Get a taste of what happens to freaks when they... Where did that pipsqueak run off to?-"</p>

<p>Zoo rose his hand as Bucken-Berry ran off, firing that ray. Ala-Gold gasped and made his next move automatically. While tackling the dark boo into Joe's new Super Happy bush, he intercepted the eviscerating beam. The yellow toad's body flopped face-first into the sandy shore, a dark pool forming from under his head. No one saw the zapper or projectile or anything, the weapon invisible. In the cacophony to follow, the toads knew they were dealing with 'Phantom'.</p><hr />

<p>Bowser sat back on the couch, repeating the cycle of checking behind the blinds every thirty seconds. His kids were going to come into town PEACEFULLY and junk to gather his minions before they got death-rayed or whatever ambiguous thing they were succumbing to, the internet on his phone super lousy. Mario texted him 'Toadley Clinic' but otherwise wasn't answering calls, which was quite common, the plumber having a way to rig his phone for clandestine communication. Bowser didn't as he had to use a brand subsidized from his kingdom. Lead by example and all that. (Meanwhile everyone else were using imports anyway..)</p>

<p>Some funky ambulance, a multicolored truck stamped 'MKDCU' pulled up. Bowser tied on the bed sheet like some loser and rushed out to it.</p>

<p>"Can I have an autograph?" gushed Sebastian in the driver's seat.</p>

<p>The passenger, an older red shelled parakoopa troopa in a straw hat, elbowed the younger man. "Quit, this is s'pposed to be secret! Howdy, pard."</p>

<p>The back doors opened for Bowser. Not feeling too good about this, he stuffed himself into what suspiciously looked like a cage regardless. The truck pulled off quickly, bumping him around. He could see into the middle and back rows of the vehicle, which seated three other people.</p>

<p>"Hey King!"</p>

<p>"Hey, chick... You alright?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I covered all my tracks and that old coot caught me."</p>

<p>"Sorry for outing ya.." Sebastian said quietly, almost unheard under Brittney Spearguy song blasting as they tore down a rural path.</p>

<p>"It wasn't bc of that notebook you left with me. Thanks though," she replied to the old classmate. "Knowing that Mack is now some dork named Claymorton made my day this morning."</p>

<p>"Dang… Sorry gal. Wait, I need to go to some 'Toadley Clinic' place instead of the hospital." Bowser strained his eyes to see out the tiny slit windows.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bowza, we know. We only deliver to dere. Didn't have a choice." James' hazmat suit was replaced with a formal white shirt and black slacks with a fedora.</p>

<p>"Whatever, thanks I guess."</p>

<p>The mega goomba agent twisted around on him, revealing his sour face and bushy goatee. Decked out in armor, he took up the entire middle row. "Is this a favor shorty, or are ya feeling sick? We ain't a charity."</p>

<p>"I agree with Richard." Wiggletron was a bespectacled lanky guysandwiched in between Emery and James. "He owes five thousand coins for four units of mileage forward and back, plus two hundred for each additional red light-"</p>

<p>"I don't have a checkbook!" Bowser fussed. "Why is this so complicated?"</p>

<p>"We'll figure it out later," Emery spoke up. "Guys, King Bowser has to get there for the sake of the world!"</p>

<p>James rolled his eyes. "Pffft. Fine. We'll waive the fee AGAIN.."</p>

<p>Parabilly switched 'WMUSH' to 'WYMSD?' a folk gospel station. Acoustic instruments blared in the truck, covering up Bowser's growling stomach. He'd forgotten to steal some snacks from Mario and it caught up with him. Like they'd read his mind, the van hopped on the mushroom interstate and got off on Starman Lane.</p>

<p>"That place got NO vegan options for me," Richard griped as Club 64 appeared over the horizon.</p>

<p>Parabilly reduced the radio. "We're actually head'n to Club Gamecube over yonder, Dick. Probabilly gave me a coupon!"</p>

<p>Bowser tolerated them pulling into a drive-thru only because it might save him from ravenously eating a spare tire back there.</p>

<p>"This just in, partners," the radio host said in a thick, near unintelligible drawl. "Up north in Toad Town, the total body count is twenty-five baddies murdered by that there killer. If yer totin a Bowser tattoo, stay cooped up somewhere safe, hear? We'll hollar at you for the Hootenanny hour in.."</p>

<p>"Wait wait wait… WHAT?" Bowser shot up, his sharp horns getting stuck in the roof.</p><hr />

<p>"Where are they?" A princess bum rushed the service desk.</p>

<p>"Over here, princess!" Yoshi scuttled beyond her into the lab with Toadette.</p>

<p>Moments later, Peach clung onto one of Dr. Toadley's spice racks for support. "There must be some mistake!"</p>

<p>"Is it? No it is not." Dr. Toadley ran some sort of calculation on his computers. "I have spoken with partners. They will assist us tomorrow to create a cure!"</p>

<p>After the frenzy settled, they gathered again in the waiting area. As Mario scanned their faces, his mental cue cards ineptly scattered. He made it simple. "It's not Bowser."</p>

<p>Sensing the storm coming, Mary the intern retrieved some headphones and put them on...</p>

<p>"The Mushroom Flu is from Dark Land and it only affected my people today! Why must you insult my intelligence? If my enemy is so innocent, he can tell me that to my face!" Peach jumped out of her seat, hands on hips.</p>

<p>"As you wish."</p>

<p>Slamming open the doors, Bowser stomped in, the dark bags under his eyes giving them a slightly different yet menacing no less image to quake at. "Darn right I'm here! You've drove me nuts, Mario! You suck! Don't you dare do this to me again or I'll pulverize ya! I didn't do anything! I wanted a nice clean match. Minus the clean part. THAT'S IT! We'd be at the bottom of this mess by now and I wouldn't have minions dying on me, forcing me to ask my kids to come down and pickup what's left of em if Mario let me do stuff MY way!"</p>

<p>Peach covered her mouth, paling. "Mario, what in star heaven is he talking about? I declare this clinic my new sanctioned facility. I will tolerate no more secrecy!"</p>

<p>Mario smiled weakly. "Perfect, I'm ready to be transparent. He's right, I've been terrible so far and I'm sorry. I wanted everything to be fine so badly I wasn't even in the same universe after a while, and that's unacceptable. To handle this going forward- I nominate: My brother, the real Mr. Hero. Luigi…"</p>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">When
	Bowser's humongous feet slammed down, iron chairs rattled, plaster
	sprinkled from the ceiling, and the tinted outside windows fissured.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr.
	Toadley kicked open his lab doors, smoke pillowing behind him from
	in-progress experiments. &quot;Will you regret that? Yes you will!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	gave the toad glare that sent him scurrying away.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Save
	that attitude. YOU conspired this!&quot; Peach snapped.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;SHUT
	YOUR MOUTH!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They ran
	up on each other like magnets, screaming accusations.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Alright,
	that's it! I'm outta here!&quot; Bowser stomped off, shoving aside
	whoever was in his way.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Who
	saw this coming..&quot; Mario excused himself as well. Couldn't let
	him level a city block.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That left
	Luigi in charge sooner than he anticipated. He accepted the awkward
	situation as the first test. Would he crumple now? -Or would Peach
	blow up first?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Princess..
	You too Yoshi. I'm in alliance with Mario on this. Messing with
	Bowser is bleeding stones. We need to refocus and I think I know
	where. If we all do this right, by the end of today we will get to
	the bottom of the Mushroom Flu..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	had leaned against the window at first, but it began to crack some
	more. He instead settled for standing around in the alley between
	the Toadley Clinic and a recreational center next door. He expected
	any minute for the red plumber to rope him back and convince him
	that Peach wasn't sneaky. She was and he knew it. Think of line she
	came from! It's why he initially hired 'old hag' Kammy to attend to
	her. His smartest ideal ever, except the part where she met Kamek,
	they fell in love and..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bleh, he
	plunged that out of his mind. So Mario and co could at any time
	crawl back and he'd maybe listen, maybe leave forever. Either way,
	Bowser wins.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	busily crossed by, &quot;You heard me. We are after a purported
	'Zoo'&hellip;&quot; The dino stopped with his back towards the
	alley. &quot;-Honey, regardless of any treaties, the central purpose
	of the Koopa Troop is to disrupt the Mushroom Kingdom. Why,
	doctrinally can't anyone, whether they carry a KT tat or not, attack
	us on their own volition? &hellip;There's no danger of me getting
	killed!&hellip; Hm, maybe a little, this is still a Bowser related
	thing..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser's
	left eye twitched. That shtick yet again..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yosh,
	hold up. Who's your carrier?&quot; Luigi asked from out of view.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Just
	switched to IslandMobile. Why?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;All
	of us YoshiMobile users are up the creek..&quot; He'd checked their
	cellular signal bars. &quot;Toadette, you have Peach's keys and this
	could throw a wrench into things before we've even started. Can you
	verify the outage at their mall kiosk? It's close.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The young
	servant clearly fought between her nice obedient reputation. &quot;Me?
	Umm, yes, but the Princess-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Peach
	is too pouty to go anywhere, so what else would she do with her
	car?...Please?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	couldn't help but to step out from the alley in time to see the
	Birthday Girl Kart and a Mach Bike speeding off from parking meters.
	Wait, so Mario deserted him! The next time he saw him, there would
	be violence&hellip;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Seconds
	later, &quot;For me?&quot; Bowser accepted a scrumptious smelling
	styrofoam container. &quot;Mmm!&quot; His hand was slapped as
	gripped the lid.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Not
	yet.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	walked him back into the Toadley Clinic. Mary the intern flinched
	upon spotting Bowser back indoors. The toad woman cut off her
	conversation with the princess by slipping on earphones and covering
	her face with a Mushroom Inquirer magazine. Mario made sure to stuff
	the receipt from the Dave and Broozers next door deep into his
	pocket and away from the sapphire blue eyes of the princess spinning
	around. A jolt went through her at the way Bowser smirked at Mario's
	side.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	perpetual darkness and crepuscular creatures of Forever Forest, east
	of Toad Town, gave it a gutter level reputation to the masses. Luigi
	suspended his unease at first, Boo would know the safe paths and
	Yoshi an outdoorsman, however the dinosaur couldn't follow them down
	the trail leading in. Trees would block coverage and apparently his
	fianc&eacute; felt she was hung up on earlier. While he got an
	earful, Luigi remained with Boo for a few more moments at the first
	junction.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-I
	can't remember how, I just know my cousin's not normal.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	slipped a hand around them. &quot;We'll be careful. I'll be honest,&quot;
	he continued shakily. &quot;This is about to be the most terrifying
	thing I've ever done. More than rescuing my brother from King Boo.
	More than the first time I even went adventuring in this world. If I
	brought you and things went wrong-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Luigi!&quot;
	The boo went for a hug.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The green
	plumber hugged back. &quot;Don't fret, I got caught up in myself.
	We'll chat later. Okay?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Tense and
	anxious, Boo unlocked their small inherited cabin. They bypassed the
	web filled pantry and marched straight to a back room filled to the
	brim with miscellaneous objects. Just like the stereotype, Boo was
	well aware they were overly sentimental, for them specifically
	manifesting in a kepto-like habit. They thought to tidy up for once
	and clear their mind.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A dusty
	family album was beneath one pile, probably swiped from a relative
	that swiped it from another and so on.. A few pages in were newer
	photos a decade old at most. It showed a huge outdoor arena, and
	then a dark boo in a top hat too large for his head training in a
	red tent. With no whip or chairs he 'tamed', or reduced to a
	stupefied expression a herd of wild red chomps, dino rhinos, and
	rexes by pointing at them only. The youngster smiled at the camera
	gleefully, ostensibly like a parent was snapping that photo.
	Flipping it over revealed a curious handwritten message.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">'Dear
	Drew, I know you are more distant now, and have left the art
	galleries to pursue that doctorate degree, but if you have the
	chance, check up on your older brother more. With our health we
	cannot keep up with his wayward ways. He will listen to you. Remind
	him of older times with this. -Love, Lou'</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo
	ripped it out and bolted for the city.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The noki
	detective, now as of this afternoon the temporary intern of a
	hospital bound quasi celebrity, divined his troubles by rushing back
	to the Mushroom Kingdom completely jetlagged. His shoes were on the
	wrong feet! He was masquerading as a tourist yes, but not from some
	backwards place like the Beanbean Kingdom or anything. He mentally
	apologized right afterwards, as an ex-Maple Treeway citizen.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	Koopa turned up his radio unsolicitedly: Snifit Patrol was tied up,
	unable to swing by a famous location. Three people officially held
	the unofficial badges, so as he was technically a vigilante that was
	a call for any other 'vigilantes' step up.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Instead
	of sitting here, we can go there, right? Right, Bond? Besides, the
	princess would want to be up on this.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The noki
	his the push button. &quot;Indeed, madame..&quot; He drove off, if
	mostly because they were next to a Hotfoot Locker, and he hated to
	see the first half of that name anywhere with who it reminded him
	of..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;By
	the way, no way that 'ol Mitch sent ya out the doors empty handed.&quot;
	Kylie unsubtly kept a bulging portfolio on her person as they drove
	along.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Joyeux
	anniversaire!&quot; Jelectro tossed a thin floppy folder to her.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	flipped it open in her lap, scanning the yellowed stapled pages in a
	New Donk minute. &quot;This connects to MF? It's his case study.
	We'd hunt down auctions. Once Tutankoopa's necklace was up. We had
	to monitor. Could be 'Special', just a general way we describe any
	kind of object 'blessed' or 'cursed'- don't matter which for sake of
	argument. Either messes people up. A museum can be iffy if okay if
	it's not interacted with much. Some grabby private collector tho was
	a heap of trouble.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jelectro
	divided his attention between her unexpectedly interesting rambling
	and squinting at street signs. Using the car's hi-tech guidance
	systems would reveal private information, and Toad Town developments
	sprung up overnight. He was getting lost and he legitimately lived
	there. Guess it looked different from his usual passenger seat.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The koopa
	reporter closed the report on cue. &quot;Aww raspberries, I let cha
	drive in circles! Royal Raceway is thataway.&quot; She jabbed a
	finger to her far right. &quot;C'mon now! You prolly heard that Toad
	Town doesn't have violent crimes much, but when it happens its like
	a clap of thunder. And then it's done.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hm!&quot;
	Jelectro smiled to shroud irritation at himself.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lilies
	lined the sides of the ramp to Peach Castle grounds. Whenever Kylie
	strolled by on errands she would think about how dedicated her
	gardener was. She'd met the pink toad once. A solid stud, if never
	speaking, only waving. Was he off today? They all drooped at the
	stalks or were withered and brown, creating a motley dilapidated
	sight. Sacrilege, she felt. They were grown like that to commemorate
	Peach taking the throne from her father.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~The
	sepia view, riddled with scratches and distortion, panned around
	rows of corpses lined up in a barren field, only a wiry mushroom
	spotted about divulging its location as the Mushroom Kingdom. The
	carefully preserved WW63 stock footage showcased scenes of the
	Mushroom World's last global war, spearheaded by tensions between
	King Morton Koopa Sr. of Dark Land and King [redacted] of the
	Mushroom Kingdom. As history went, the stars were favorable to the
	human king and K. Morton was cornered in Water Land and diced to
	pieces by allied forces.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A hand
	made a firm grip on Bowser's forearm. That's what his 'friend' got
	for nagging to watch those old reels in the attic. With that out of
	the way, they share the buzz of excitement. They planned to travel
	far to the Waffle Kingdom and back before dark, a location neither
	had seen outside of Luigi's writings. They learned while ambling
	around that he had not embellished one bit. There was a syrup river
	and hills made of pancake. They laid back on the high calorie soil,
	watching the pink cotton candy clouds drift about. Like usual,
	something mundane they were chatting about escalated into debate.
	Bowser thought he always dominated these. He was louder, scarier,
	stronger. His friend on the other hand more observant, unfortunately
	for him. A well timed shove sent him spinning on his shell
	uncontrollably down hill, and splashing into a soda lake. Cherry
	cola.~</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	rose up from the cot and swung at Dr. Toadley, missing by a hair.
	&quot;AHH! THAT WAS CHEATING YOU-... I mean .. I'M NEVER DOING THAT
	AGAIN! ...I just.. It's useless..&quot; he tacked on, coughing.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	doctor grumbled as he lowered the invention, a zapper with a dish on
	the end with a swirl pattern etched on it. &quot;Did I have the
	switch flipped to 'happy place' and not 'sad place'? Yes I did.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	irritably slung his feet out of the bed. In the lab space he took up
	the sixth spot next to the others, including Toad and Daisy,
	remaining unconscious. &quot;You didn't send me far into the past
	during the first Mushroom Flu. You sent me 'kinda' in the past,
	during a moment when I was watching something that predated the flu.
	.. I don't feel like explaining it. When is Peach's turn?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;When
	she's back. Sure you didn't see anything that might help?&quot;
	Mario asked. &quot;You kept mumbling.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Blushing,
	&quot;You were watchin' me??&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;For
	science, jeez!! You've seen me sleep. How else would you know the
	brand of my sleeping mask?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	laughed dryly. &quot;I didn't know that Mini Bowser had a record
	feature. Scary to put that in children's toys, ain't it?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Meanwhile,
	the loud squeak of a cart the intern was pushing around was verging
	on unbearable. She hurried to get away from Bowser, Mario suspected.
	The plumber removed his hat and swapped it for a worn in black
	leather jacket with assorted patches hanging on a coat rack. He
	slipped it on, just a half size too large. Machine oil and beer
	struck his nose.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh!
	Sir?&quot; The intern fumbled with the vials on the rack. &quot;That's
	mine. I mean-&quot;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Yeah,
	your boyfriend or someone. I&rsquo;m just borrowing it for a sec.
	Peach is </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">still</font></em>
	<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">in Dave and
	Broozers and I doubt it&rsquo;s because she&rsquo;s having a ball. I
	need to be less recognizable.&rdquo; He heard Bowser groaning
	already. So clingy, he thought with alacrity. &ldquo;Stick here, but
	since you gave this a fair shot and you were dreaming about food,
	you can open that box I gave you,&rdquo; he said on the way out.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Inside
	was a slice of yellow cake with white frosting, red and blue candies
	adorning the top. A couple&rsquo;s cake.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jelectro
	slammed the brakes, spinning the car ninety degrees where Royal
	Raceway terminated. Peach's Castle was no longer there, only a deep
	crater with pipes gushing water. All the vegetation, the grass,
	trees, garden in the back, were dead. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Help!!&quot;
	Chef Tim saw the car first, apron stained red. A lime-green toad in
	the lawn whimpered while holding one of his legs, clothes sparkling
	from broken glass. He kept complaining it was broken, and that he&rsquo;d
	never get to travel with Peach and pretend to be a rich socialite
	again. A golden yellow toad was sprawled across the lake shore,
	darkened by his blood. A mature purple toad worked busily to
	resuscitate him.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	Koopa stumbled out of the car, agape.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-One
	of our stewards ran for help because phones are dead,&rdquo; Zeror
	explained.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Start
	at the beginning for crying out loud! What&rsquo;s the straight
	dope??&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Les
	slowly stood up from Alagold. &ldquo;It happened in a blink. A so
	called reporter came by, a boo-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	trembled. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she whispered. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-And
	tried to start a witch hunt for Darklandians. Now our latest toad is
	missing, along with the castle, and Old Toadsworth. Got your
	story??&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Where&rsquo;s
	the princess?...With Mario? We&rsquo;ll find them and get you help.
	Hold on-&rdquo; Kylie retreated to the car, appalled that the noki
	was glued in his seat. When she sat down she began to worry. He was
	pale and in a cold sweat, grimacing. &ldquo;Bond, what&rsquo;s
	happening?&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mitch..&rdquo;
	</font>
	</p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	Airship One vibrated and exuded noxious black smoke in places not
	thought possible the longer it flew, a harsh reminder to Ludwig Von
	Koopa that he hadn&rsquo;t personally taken the menacing beast, the
	oldest flying machine in Bowser&rsquo;s fleet, on a proper
	expedition in years. Newer aircraft were at his disposal, but this
	one had a history central to his objective, enough to make him
	overlook the lack of doppler radar, yaw dampeners, and cup holders.
	Scratch the doppler part. Because of that, they&rsquo;d hit a
	hurricane over Water Land, forcing most of them below deck&hellip;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry&rsquo;s
	wooden bench squeaked as he stood up on it to peek over his older
	brother&rsquo;s phone. The MP3 player that was driving his red BATES
	by Dr. Greg headphones at full blast had died moments ago. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy
	quickly flipped it screen down. &ldquo;Oh, Larry-chan, haha just
	texting Sam and Slam. They&rsquo;re luh-olded they keep bragging
	online. Err, think they misplaced a decimal though on their
	paycheck. Puzzling when they are the top math wizards in college. &rdquo;
	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boring.
	Everyone breathed on each other among a concoction of gunpowder,
	soot, and toejam. No electricity or charging ports, just wooden
	splinter filled seating. Larry checked out a foggy porthole window,
	unable to see much. Wendy detached from the &lsquo;cool&rsquo;
	bunch, Roy, her, and Morton, the latter if just for a prop, to seek
	out Iggy. They were discussing some game until Lemmy joined them. On
	the trip until now, Larry only saw his face in a training manual. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Excuse
	me sis. Sup, Iggy! How much did you pay them?&rdquo; Lemmy cringed
	at Iggy&rsquo;s answer, more so upon getting a technical explanation
	involving extra drag from the weight they took on. &quot;Leeet's not
	tell Luddy about that.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Pretending
	to be occupied, Larry snickered. &lsquo;Yeah, squirm goody
	two-shoes!&rsquo; Sam and Slam didn&rsquo;t work for their dad, but
	the mischief they sparked at times rivaled any koopaling. Once at a
	party they triple dared Lemmy to kiss a girl. The chain-chompette
	was flattered and a good sport about the spectacle, but it was so
	awkward it wasn&rsquo;t even funny and she was definitely pregnant
	because of that. Psyche! (In the spirit of Lem.)</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The doors
	above opened, letting wind roll in. A drenched Ludwig stood at the
	top of stairs. &ldquo;We have arrived-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
	trampled him completely in the chaotic rush for fresh air.
	Flattened, Ludwig checked his watch. Only an hour or two later than
	the estimated arrival.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy bent
	all the way over the railing, virtual-reality goggles strapped to
	his face to enhance the signature green hills of the Mushroom
	Kingdom jutting upwards. First the outskirts, Goomba Village, Flower
	Fields, then the dense capital city. Kamek cruised them cautiously
	high. After the threat of suffocation subsided, everyone found their
	vices once more on the breezy slippery deck. Roy never hung up with
	the new name compared to two days ago. Morton and Wendy clung around
	him in mutual interest of who girl #282,938 was, etc..</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Umm.
	Luddy, could you show me that concert hall?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He dusted
	himself off and stepped over. &ldquo;The Royal Toadstool Opera?
	Direct your attention there..&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	younger brother beamed upon locating its golden dome. He got to see
	it for a moment before clouds rolled in.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">..And
	why do you ask, General Lemmy? Only I am aware due to being an
	acquaintance of an acquaintance who is a tenor in composer Bise&rsquo;s
	acapella brigade. Astronomically exclusive, unless of course YOU are
	invited to perform in it. Then you are bestowed indisputable
	permission to occupy that beautiful, glorious- tell no one I
	complement it so- theater.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With
	everyone busy and the town hidden, Larry snuck over to their snoring
	driver. He knew how to time Kamek's power naps. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-
	Interesting,&rdquo; Lemmy giggled forcibly. &ldquo;...What if
	someone with a high position in Dark Land was invited and wanted to
	perform, but not disassociate themselves from the Troop or
	anything?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Checking
	over his shoulders, Larry rolled the wheel subtly enough to hide the
	banked turn. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-That
	poor soul must never grace our homeland with their presence again!
	To partake at the table of the princess for any reason is a renegade
	maneuver. Must I explain their pedagogy?!&rdquo; Ludwig ranted.
	&ldquo;They are unable to eschew their speciest trite about
	non-mushroom people.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	know I know.. Psyche! Ha ha..&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
	matched with the longitude his app told him too. Thank Boogle Maps.
	It cheered him up better than finding a wallet on the ground full of
	cash. On their new course they&rsquo;d head north, rise in altitude,
	and beach catastrophically on Star Hill, ending their trip. He
	climbed into a lookout post to bide time. He wondered what his
	online friends were doing in town. How they may react if they knew
	he was above their city about to -almost- invade?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bang!
	They violently came to a stop, ejecting Larry into the air. When he
	came to, he was back on deck with a headache. Everything not nailed
	down was knocked overboard and their sails were shredded. Even more
	bizarre, he was starting at Peach Castle, suspended in the air with
	them. The windows were shattered, the paint chipped, and the hollow
	darkened structure was plucked from the ground imperfectly, creating
	an eerie left tilt on the impenetrable floating platform they&rsquo;d
	crashed into. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Behind
	him lots were being drawn.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Come
	back here, please. Is it not enough that you allowed us to get blown
	off course??&rdquo; Ludwig fussed at the geriatric magikoopa
	shuffling around, covered in small bandages like the others. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kamek
	muttered something about being innocent, continuing to circle the
	deck except for the bow that caved in from the impact. The results
	were in. Morton was chosen. He eagerly accepted and hurled himself
	overboard without looking down, smacking flat against a low point of
	elevation. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m okay&rsquo; he yelled back. Roy and
	Wendy immediately decided they were accompanying him. It was too
	frosty out here for their blood and they wanted either action or to
	snatch a goodie or two. That left Iggy with a broken and loose but
	fully armed and operational VR headset on his face. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Since
	28.57 percent of us have deviated, how much would it upset you if it
	rose to 33.333? I&rsquo;m tempted to go in and use my x-ray feature
	to scan the castle&rsquo;s interior and find those rumored sealed
	copies of SM64.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	waved him off with a groan. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
	fought his vertigo to stand up. What a sick joke. That was his best
	con he felt. What was left? He wracked his brain. Ludwig owned
	theology books that he'd skimmed through for a pop quiz. One thing
	Larry remembered was that star heaven had disturbing parallels to
	his high school. Maybe they'd dip their divine toes in this mess. </font>
	</p>
	<p><em>&rsquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yo,
	stars above. Confuse the speech of my enemies!&rsquo; </font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	opened his eyes and saw a fight.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">General
	Lemmy, I concern myself not with those unaccounted for delinquents!
	Do not covertly whisper such to me again. After I destroy the
	Mushroom Kingdom they will effectively be back home anyway. It is
	obvious that the two we actually sent here, Sam and Slam,
	accomplished their mission. Last I checked the hospitals are full.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">But
	we've screwed up so much King Dad's not gonna care about how
	&lsquo;brilliant&rsquo; your plan was!!!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	will when I have the princess!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
	princess? Look!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wendy was
	in the front, she&rsquo;d even taken her shoes off in the mad dash.
	Roy, Morton, and Iggy were behind her and Roy had a body tucked
	under his arm. Wendy took the ladder while her brothers ascended the
	hull with their bare claws, beating her pace. Morton flopped down
	like a dead cheep cheep on the deck, under the snapped and torn
	rigging. A weird gait was normal from Iggy, not exactly the king,
	prince, duke, or earl, of good posture. Now however he slithered low
	to the ground and hid below deck. Roy was over exerted but sound it
	seemed until it was discovered he was mute. The extra person toted
	along was a beaten black and blue Chancellor Toadsworth.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ahhhh!
	What happened??&rdquo; Lemmy lost balance with his ball.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wendy
	made it onboard. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know!!!! OMGOMGOMG-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Sister
	mine, English!&quot; Ludwig begged. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	only got as far as the first big room. It&rsquo;s ruined and
	everything is hazy inside. So crazy. Part of upstairs collapsed too.
	I was gonna go deeper with them, but there was this weird rumble
	thing I kept hearing. I thought maybe not, but y'all know I don't
	just bail on folks..&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Flustered,
	Ludwig nodded. &ldquo;General Lemmy, Wendy, even Kamek, secure
	everyone below deck. Larry, bypass Iggy&rsquo;s password and try to
	use that application he has to trace the location of Vater&rsquo;s
	last communication. I will distance us.&quot; Working in some sort
	of automatic mode, he spun their airship into a deep starboard turn.
	Debris broke off from their superstructure as he pushed the ship to
	full power in a spontaneous direction. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
	didn&rsquo;t know to be afraid or giddy as he traced the location of
	their father. Everything moved turbo fast then. He wished he
	remembered to be... careful of what he wished for!</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
	had a problem. She'd gotten sidetracked, took too long, and now
	things were getting damp and she couldn't get Peach's top on- on her
	convertible rather. She would press the electric switch and nothing
	would happen aside from a faint mechanical buzz. Why did she let Mr.
	Luigi talk her into this? In the mild precipitation, she barely
	caught the royal blue spots and vest of her boyfriend dragging his
	feet on the side of the street.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	swerved over. &quot;Blue! Oh my goodness, this is random but great.
	I've come up with an alibi. Get in.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He perked
	up somewhat, making the suspension creak when he got in the
	waterlogged kart. Though he disguised it under his ordinary steely
	mask, she could tell he'd shed tears very recently.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Where's
	Mario and Peach? I gotta see them now! I told the police.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Frowning,
	she pulled off. &quot;I'm missing something?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He leaned
	over and gave her a quick kiss. &quot;Thank Eldstar you're safe.
	Some batsh- some.. crazy dude attacked us and the castle and-&quot;
	In a sudden fit he slugged the side view mirror. The enclosure
	snapped and dangled by a wire. &quot;Oh stars.. Sorry baby..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	blanched. &quot;..I'll take the fall for that if you get the hood on
	with minimum destruction.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Buckenberry
	broke only one cheap plastic tab pulling it over them manually,
	freeing them from the rain. That might have been a bad deal she'd
	just made.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hi
	there. Is this a fun place?&quot; A man with a shy soft voice seated
	himself on the stool next to a blonde woman in a white doctor's
	coat.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
	crossed leg over the other, training her eyes across the bar where
	there was a dark laser tag room. While there weren't many kids
	playing arcade games, skeeball, ice-hockey, and other activities
	today, she remained hesitant to explore or remove the half baked
	disguise. &quot;It seems wholesome, but I hazard I'd never known it
	existed if not for unfortunate events today.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	refused a beverage from the bartender. &quot;-Like what, doll?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	stirred her hot tea. &quot;You would think I'm hysterical! No need
	to weigh you down,&quot; she remarked playfully.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Surely
	not too heavy for Mario,&quot; Mario replied.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She faced
	him, dumbstruck. In that less signature state he possessed more of a
	glow if anything, the jacket, hair, short stubble. In aggregate
	though, it was another person, and she wasn't so obtuse to refuse to
	see it. &quot;-I told you my contributions about that tragedy won't
	get us a fraction closer to the cure. Leave me be.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His gaze
	bore into her as he returned to her tea, drumming his fingers on the
	counter. &quot;You can't get over Bowser. Is it because he's so
	different or because you can't see it?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Neither
	of those. I'm processing matters.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;So
	am I, but none of us can control the pace now. Least you could do is
	not be another-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;What,
	Mario?&quot; Her cup clank against the table. &quot;Excuse me for
	not being able to change overnight!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Overnight?!
	Am I not tolerable if I'm not stomping bad guys for you?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
	are intolerable when you pester me, Mario. That is what.&quot; She
	sipped an empty cup, flushing. The bartender had not so subtly
	stayed away during that spat, and still wouldn't get her next order.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Two adult
	toads burst inside. Bucken-Berry and Toadette dodged the ticket
	booth, trampled velvet ropes, and tugged Peach into the private
	party rooms, right under Mario's nose. Startled he waited outside
	the room. Peach sobbed something about the castle and.. Mario was
	missing pieces and shouldn't try to pry information now. He decided
	to simply ring up Toadsworth with the castle landline.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	crept into the Dave and Broozers back office when no staff were
	looking. He closed the door, inadvertently locking himself in a tiny
	room. He'd deal with that later. He picked up the grungy beige wall
	phone. While it rang he noticed the old newspaper clips taped to the
	wall and some stale french fries and pizza on the counter.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;HELLO?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	flinched. That was louder than any motorcycle. Louder than a jet!
	&quot;I-is this Peach Castle?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;YES,
	IT IS.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
	particle-like appendage seeped from the speaker, coiling around his
	neck. The strangled plumber was lifted up and slammed against the
	water dispenser, toppling the stacks of paper cups, then across the
	counter, knocking off the food and microwave. He couldn't pull it
	off, consciousness fading. Last he recognized was a thud, the door
	kicked open. Someone stomped over frantically and helped him tear
	the entity off. With a threatening roar it phased away from their
	palms with no trace. Mario would have passed out, blue faced, if his
	rescuer didn't support him by both shoulders.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Well,
	say somethin'!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The black
	spots in his vision cleared. &quot;Bowser, oh God. You must of
	followed me and- A monster or something at her castle attacked over
	the line..&quot; He laughed weakly at how he sounded. &quot;Anyway,
	you had my back. Thank you.&quot; He closed the distance, nestling
	his face against Bowser's collarbone.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	warmth of a human Bowser had become accustomed to, especially today,
	but the brush of that mustache against his thick scale plates in
	that particular way was new, exciting. With a small gasp he pushed
	back. &quot;S-stop. We can't.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Sorry.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	fidgeted. &quot;Nah. I don't know why I said that..&quot; He pulled
	Mario closer, smothering him all over again.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Peach's
	and I's thing that never was is.. extra never gonna be,&quot; he
	droned, lulled by their embrace.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	barely got that.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yeah..
	I.. know.&quot; Mario accepted that didn't want to return to the
	countless adversities waiting outside.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Well,
	believe that I'm not dazed and confused when I say this. Peach's
	castle just broke up with- the Earth!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Darn it.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A little
	boo belched and swayed as they emerged from Club Gamecube, Club 64's
	competitor. It was the happy hour, and Boo took advantage of a half
	price Morel Moxie to not faint from exhaustion running ragged around
	Toad Town. Too worried to think straight, they&rsquo;d had an
	additional sip of another beverage at steep discount, a Chuckola
	cola, the Japanese version. That was quite stupid they understood
	once the stomach began to rumble. Trying to keep right side up on
	the street, they thought they hallucinated a low Bowser Doomship, an
	ugly spot in the sky, diving beneath a cloud. They rubbed their
	reddened eyes and it was still there, going north.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	forces were attacking!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo
	followed the trail into a more rural part of town. Few buildings and
	no high rises, just mushroom fields. Blind sided, they walked into a
	metal road sign, 'Watch for crossing Ostros.&rsquo; Dealing with
	that throbbing on their forehead, they anguished. Why did they botch
	everything? Why couldn&rsquo;t they follow instructions? </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Why
	couldn&rsquo;t they avoid getting ran over by a truck?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">HONK. A
	colorful medical van swerved around the body on the dirt path. It
	braked and went into reverse, parking beside Boo. The paratroopa
	passenger&rsquo;s window rolled down. &ldquo;Partner, now you KNOW
	that&rsquo;s not the place to hit the sack!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo; <font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Let&rsquo;s
	goooooo,&rdquo; whined the ansty toad girl in the back. &ldquo;I
	gotta tell my King something and we can&rsquo;t miss him!!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah.
	It&rsquo;s just a drunk, shorty,&rdquo; Richard added.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Offended
	and more sober, Boo impetuously distanced themselves from the MKDCU
	and returned to town. Glancing at Zoo&rsquo;s photo ever so often,
	the main reason they&rsquo;d ventured out renewed in their mind.
	This was why the phone thing sucked so much. Their cousin had a
	weakness and only they knew it. They had to get to the park.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;We'll
	handle it. Have a good day.&quot; Luigi eased the snufit towards his
	silver patrol car parked in a flower bed.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Gotcha!&quot;
	Snifit Patrol put away his taser, the area cleared. &quot;We're on
	full alert for Zoo. My sergeant will get the toads and drop them off
	at Hotel Mario... What's the issue with it?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	didn't have time to explain, retreating to the picnic area of Toad
	Town park. &quot;Now what's wrong, Yoshi?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The dino
	sat on a tree stump agitatedly. &quot;It's the mingle advert you
	made with my phone. Typing it in Darklandian? Including some kind of
	'emojis' you said represent Bowser affiliation? I'm lost.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	rolled his eyes, then waved to the four others with him at the
	table. &quot;Flare, Gloomba, and Chuck weren't. Yoshi, please scout
	for us again. It's important.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The Toad
	Town park was a donut shaped plot of green, the center tightly
	packed shade trees overgrowing the garden that was once there. Yoshi
	absently patrolled the weathered brickwork of the walking paths and
	around the statues of old patriarchs erected here and there. No
	pedestrians were encountered unless he tread to the street's edge.
	Since the meeting at the Toadley Clinic, he kept waiting in vain for
	Luigi to reveal the extent of his plan. Being given simple orders,
	like he was just some toad and not someone with more experience
	arguably than Mario, embittered him in a way he couldn't hide
	anymore.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A sports
	car skidded to a stop at the Mushroom Press a block down. A short
	noki and a koopa girl argued before he left her behind. As he sped
	away off, the girl recklessly hopped into the trunk.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	ventured inside a quiet office building, the Press. Cold air
	condition blast hit him right away. Birdo worked in a place like
	this before becoming an influencer, so he knew the layout. This was
	ground zero for their target. If Luigi didn't want him to wander off
	and educate himself, be straight with him!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I'll
	try.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh,
	I didn't notice... Yes it's Yoshi, sorry to intrude. A reporter here
	is one of my suspects you may say. Am I allowed to browse?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The guy
	Yoshi stumbled upon in the cubical nodded slowly, his youthful beady
	black eyes narrowing suspiciously behind tortoiseshell horn rimmed
	prescription lenses. He seemed like the archetypical yuppie with a
	dry impersonal tone. His desk was tidy and a touch bougie with the
	fake gold plated office d&eacute;cor, including a framed abstract
	painting. Work related, this person had posted detailed lists. Due
	to the jumbo font they were deliberately printed and the fact that
	his computer displayed the local message boards, Yoshi sleuthed he'd
	been following current events.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Thank
	you. Since you are here, do you have any details on Susie, aka Zoo
	Diddley?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">One of
	the man's thick black eyebrows arched in amusement. &quot;This is
	his space.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Beaming,
	the dino swept the area again. Yoshi anticipated squalor, but
	apparently not. &quot;Wonderful. What were you doing here?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Are
	you stupid bro?&quot; The boo removed his glasses.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Like a
	veil lifted, Yoshi registered he was face to face with Zoo, at his
	throat in an instant.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Shhhh!
	No screaming in the office.&quot; Zoo shoved Yoshi through the wall,
	phasing them both outdoors, the dinosaur specifically stunned on his
	butt. &quot;I HATE THAT FREAKING LUIGI!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	climbed to his feet, flabbergasted. Zoo hiding in plain sight? How
	could he be so na&iuml;ve? He sprinted as fast he could through the
	park. The grass sprouted ten feet tall, making him scale over. The
	statutes animated and chased him, firing off musket rounds that
	hummed past his ear. The trees stretched their limbs to entrap him.
	A sand castle in the lot rose to scale, becoming a labyrinth.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	rushed to where Yoshi collapsed, yards away from the tables. &quot;Yoshi?
	What happened?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	appeared beside him with a whoosh. Luigi jumped back and the baddies
	at the picnic table recoiled. &quot;Me. If you didn't cut me slack
	with the bike I swear I'd.. So why are you luring me here?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	hesitated for a second. &quot;W-what's the password?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo held
	a blank expression.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
	found the ad but you can't read Darklandian. Why did you blend in
	with baddies to try to kill them off later? Without leaving a mark?&quot;
	As the dark boo flushed, he knew his theories were hitting the mark.
	&quot;Regardless, you have something to do with this virus plot. You
	were at the game with the sodas. You've been around the hospital.
	You've been where every dead soldier was. Yet, it's not your scheme.
	Who's is it?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	leered at the baddies, making them screech and scatter chaotically,
	then composed himself. &quot;I give ya a B+ on that assessment,
	Sherlock Mario.&quot; He laughed cryptically, Luigi standing his
	ground. Like he hadn't heard a million boos cackle by then. &quot;Bro,
	the press job wasn't even to watch that boring game. I've been
	trying to be an office worker forever. Better than that the
	entertainment biz. I got caught up in something that led to another
	thing and another thing and on it snowballs. That's all you need to
	hear. Split bro. Or else.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	folded his arms. &quot;I will not.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	will make you,&quot; Zoo said deliberately. &quot;And this will
	leave a mark.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There was
	a piercing sensation across Luigi midsection, like a cleaver chopped
	him. His vantage rose upwards by a couple of inches, but his boots
	were still planted on the ground. Looking down, his face twisted in
	agony. Like a medical diagram, he saw into the lower half of his
	lungs where his body was abruptly severed, into his stomach, liver,
	and upper large intestine, pockets of bile in exposed sections. He
	didn't bleed, like the force splitting and suspending him holding it
	back, but he could still feel every bit of his skin and organs
	ripped apart.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He was
	losing his body, but if he could speak he'd be saying </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I've
	lost my head</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	jolted upwards in hysteria that only lessened when he noticed eye
	movements from the still alive green plumber, trained to something.
	The dino twisted around. He couldn't believe who it was.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Meanwhile,
	Zoo caught slow sluggish Chuck right away, wedged in place after
	trying to hide in a tube slide. The dark boo detected however that
	when the spike was done with that nervous breakdown, he was going to
	live with his mom in Ice Land and never talk about this again. Those
	others were the problem then.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Flare and
	Gloomba tore across the field, almost out of the park. Flare was an
	older koopa, getting left behind constantly despite his protests.
	They came upon a portapotty and Gloomba dove in first, shutting out
	Flare.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He banged
	the plastic panel. &quot;Soldier, you will let me in!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Tough!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	benignly walked up behind Flare and snapped the lock. &quot;GET
	OUT!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hey
	buddy!&quot; Gloomba, younger stubbly faced foot soldier, stumbled
	into the open. &quot;I'm on your side, for real.. That guy stinks.
	Kill him instead!&quot; Flare gave him a poignant look.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	clicked his tongue. &quot;Don't tell me what to do.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Gloomba
	wailed, his dark grey flesh glistening and expelling from pores
	moisture. The invisible force crushed him and his shriveled corpse
	flopped into the grass.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The fire
	brother stopped squeezing his eyes shut. He was still alive, but
	with that sadistic look on Zoo's face, he knew the mercy was
	fleeting. He calmly remained there, no resistance.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;If
	this is my punishment, so be it. I came to support King Bowser's
	tennis game and not to desert or quit. I've always loved the sport.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hmm.&quot;
	Zoo chuckled dryly, revealing a green Bowser racket. &quot;Prove it.
	Give me your best serve.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	volunteer for him. Swap,&quot; someone said, voice somewhat clogged
	and gritty. They had a huge purple knot on their forehead and
	faintly reeked of a bar, but they were simultaneously alert and
	shifty eyed.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	whipped around. &quot;Cuz?&quot; He saw what was slid into his hands
	in exchange. A photo of his first performance on tour with his
	immediate family, taken in Donut Plains. &quot;Where did you find
	this?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Doesn't
	matter. Unfortunately for you, I remember everything. I. Remember.
	Everything.&quot; Booigi the Second rose the racket into the sky.
	&quot;By the power of Eldstar, this will be the last day you bully
	me.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lightning
	flashed above. Yoshi was heading over when he dove under the jungle
	gym. Upon finding that it was nothing, he brain was screaming to get
	out there, do something, underpowered or not. His sixty-four year
	old, engergy sapped body said otherwise..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
	showing off for your plumber crush back there? Which half of em?&quot;
	Zoo cooed, making kissy faces. &quot;Ha, dweeb.&quot; He fired his
	death ray against his older cousin to no effect, short of angering
	Booigi more. He remembered he could only mutilate living things, and
	even worse he got his teeth bashed in by the racket.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The dark
	boo skid backwards until a concrete base stopped him. The bust of
	Princess Mush IV, frequently defaced for being so controversial as a
	ruler, shattered from impact. Dazed, he felt lighter. To his horror,
	the impact dislodged his father's bell from his pockets and it lay
	in the grass between him and his cousin, racing at him.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No!&quot;
	Zoo scrambled to hover protectively over it.. &quot;Back off! My old
	apartment burned! That's the last thing I still have from dad and
	I-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Booigi
	teleported behind him and snatched it. &quot;I'm gonna bat it outta
	here!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	chased them around the field. Even tipsy, Boo was faster and more
	experienced in teleportation Zoo learned infuriatingly. It didn't
	help that Zoo had left behind his eyewear at the office. He's gotten
	dozens of scrapes and cuts from bumping solid objects around the
	park. Finally his cousin held the bell precariously over a fountain.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	abruptly froze. &quot;Listen cuz. I'll leave if I can keep that.
	It'll be like a body under the bridge. I mean water, haha.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Booigi
	lowered the antique. &quot;Tell me everything.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No,
	I'm not a minion, but Ludwig let's outside help do menial jobs
	sometimes. I clean up Bowser's Castle on weekends. That's how I knew
	some scheduled stuff. That's all. Here is where I wanted to work,
	not there. Then at the stadium I was r worded enough to pass around
	sodas from Iggy's nerd friends. I didn't know they were with the KT,
	one had some mental block, or that the soda was poisoned and I don't
	freaking care! Less to compete against me when I'm making six
	figures!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;And
	the murders??&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Can't
	have this ordeal on a resume, bro.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Don't
	call me that by the way.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yeah,
	shut up.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With a
	sly grin, Booigi shook their head. &quot;But, I didn't show you my
	swing.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The dark
	boo's jaw dropped when Booigi tossed the bell into the air and
	sliced it with the racket, seeing it up up and away, into the sky
	and out of view. Like a mad man, Zoo bolted after it, out of the
	park.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Back at
	the picnic tables Luigi fell to the ground whole. Numbly he kept
	patting where the cut was. Under his shirt, he found an ugly scar
	circling his midsection. That was the last he remembered. Yoshi saw
	him fall out, caught him in fact. A mild earthquake lasted for a
	second, originating from something a great distance away. Then
	silence.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Then not
	because YoshiMoblie, proudly Toad Towns largest wireless provider,
	began to work again.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
	dropped down a ladder at the location Iggy's cell directed, Mario's
	house. Wendy personally went down to break in. Empty. On the way out
	a toad neighbor, an overweight dude in a robe with coffee, spotted
	her. Not the type they'd think to own a Bullet Blaster kart, but
	whatever. The seventeen year old in a panic vaporized him with
	Iggy's laser gun from an anime. Once the smoke cleared, all that was
	left of him were his slippers.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	koopaling teen raced to cover her mouth. She'd seen the commercials.
	They claimed it only had 'play' laser action! Before they left, a
	van stopped under their airship. Some toad girl was kicked out and
	waved desperately for them.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;What
	do you want? Also you totally didn't see us here or anything!&quot;
	Lemmy called down.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I'm
	tight with King. I've made up my mind and I will join you. A toad is
	your best weapon. Trust me!&quot; she yelled upwards.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
	tried to consult Ludwig, but he disallowed his concentration to be
	broken, going on about a 'phenomena unexplainable by accepted
	scientific principles, leaving only the 'unaccepted' ones'.. Wendy
	and Lemmy glanced at each other and allowed her on.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Emery T.
	hopped around excitedly, disregarding the ship's deplorable
	condition. She told them Bowser must still be at the Toadley Clinic
	then. Duh. Why didn't they call? They were too afraid Lemmy in
	particular explained. Larry cooperated with whatever little task,
	like handing the ropes, but was otherwise elsewhere in mindset until
	he saw a shooting star seem to emerge from the center of the town
	and blast out of the city, soon just a distant twinkle.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Eldstar
	would be late for the first time in eons. He put aside all
	reservations and forced himself off his throne. He&rsquo;d leave a
	note. Now where was the pen? His grey mustache kept twitching as he
	searched high and low, clearing dust bunnies. Those &lsquo;others&rsquo;
	had found a way to mess with him, but who and where? All he knew,
	his power was being tapped.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With
	great detail and conviction, all of Mushroomy background could
	explain that he primarily worked to keep the world in balance by
	imparting his power. There is a caveat. There is perpetual struggle
	within the celestial barriers. The reason why stars fall, or even
	die. This remains shrouded from other realms for their protection,
	to not even expose them to that of which only leads to destruction.
	Eldstar detested such conflict, but as the epitome of fairness those
	unsightly realities had their place on the board, the image
	incomplete without the unquestionable presence of all stars of all
	dispositions.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Did that
	make any sense? </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He wasn&rsquo;t
	sure anymore.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">At last,

	NEWS!!! Approximately this afternoon our princess&rsquo;s servants
	were attacked in her absence by renegade &lsquo;Zoo S. Diddley&rsquo;.
	The castle is in total ruins. Two toads are unaccounted for, beloved
	Chanslor Toadsworth and an unknown steward. Multiple toads injured,
	and one very serious. Luigi Mario and his team vanquished Zoo from
	town. It&rsquo;s suspected he and his conspirators known as &lsquo;Sam
	and Slam&rsquo; may have been behind the latest epidemic- and the
	influx of off duty Koopa Troop homicides on our streets~</font></em>
		</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Working
	in the dark, as the Press was closed now, red haired human languidly
	purged the dark boo's belongings into a white garbage bag.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Too..
	reads like a scattered synopsis, doll,&quot; her boss lowered the
	rough draft from his face. &quot;How long you been here?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Since
	the 00s.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Steve
	shook his body exasperatedly. &quot;Hm. You know better then. Erase
	the part about the koopa scum. Say a Mario brother instead of Luigi.
	See? Emphasize the MARIO. What brought you anyway? Always meant to
	ask. Don't see too many humans..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Because
	they tend to be unwillingly warped here, kinda like their 'gods' the
	Mario Bros. She didn't have super human abilities nor a coincidental
	run in with the princess leading to a decades long partnership, so
	she wound up here, a receptionist to anthropomorphs and else, like
	the talking bullet bill hovering around her. She starting to miss
	Mitch despite his hot kingdom takes, usually keeping her company
	late into the evening and also Steve at bay.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jessie
	hesitated with a small painting Zoo owned. By artist 'Drew L. D.',
	it was titled &quot;Assemblation&quot; - a bunch of random colors
	spiraling. Too bad it'd be given up to Snifit Patrol, who classed
	the belonging as 'evidence'.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The way
	everyone gathered around his phone reading the latest Toad Town
	bulletin reminded Larry Koopa of his current freshman year.
	Considered antisocial by the administration of Badlands High, his
	milking incited brawls, fragmented cliques, and triggered
	after-school warfare. Hold fire! He was just the messenger. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	fifteen year old lingered above deck to watch the trainwreck unfold.
	How would Ludwig shroud their mishaps? Disappointingly Larry
	discerned an easy out for Luddy. They had scapegoats, acknowledged
	by the news media&rsquo;s coverage. Bowser orbiters, not soldiers,
	easily distanced from. That only left explaining why they were in
	possession of Toadsworth..</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	mistook him for my grandpa and we abducted him. Done,&rdquo; Emery
	answered, also annoyingly sticking around.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He had to
	stop thinking out loud.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Anyway,
	I meet the fitness requirements, General. I airlifted. Do you know
	how heavy patients are these days?&rdquo; She blabbered over the
	shoulder of the vessel&rsquo;s captain. &ldquo;..Hello? Well when I
	bring it up to King, I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll get me trained on
	the artillery. I&rsquo;ve always dreamed of blowing stuff up&hellip;&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig&rsquo;s
	eye twitched, aggravated enough from the daunting task of navigating
	their humongous doomship, a symbol of evil and oppression to
	Mushroomites, through Toad Town&rsquo;s dark evening skies. Their
	destination was going to be the park, as traditional, quiet, and
	family friendly as it went. Maybe so, but because it was usually
	vacant Larry knew. According to online friends, everyone under the
	age of 65 ignored it and its high grass, mosquitoes, and creepy
	statues in favor of malls and clubs. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
	are you so worried about? I&rsquo;m King&rsquo;s best weapon. If
	we&rsquo;re spotted I&rsquo;ll have another excuse!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	whipped around and snapped &ldquo;-You may smarm a witless citizen,
	Miss Toady, but I doubt the princess and Mario.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
	can&rsquo;t tell me anything! Mario even quit today, King texted me
	earlier, so all of this hero villain stuff isn&rsquo;t his business
	anymore.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He stared
	blankly. &ldquo;Emery, am I being toyed with?!&rdquo; He shook
	himself out of it. &ldquo;Implausible. General Larry, please
	verify.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
	swiped around the message boards. &ldquo;&hellip;People were moaning
	and groning online about how Luigi will be in the news now. That
	doesn't prove nothing!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A smirk
	was etched on his brilliant face. &ldquo;Negatory. We are not
	amateurs are we? The Mushroomites reverence of Mario Mario is so
	great, they would never question his heroic integrity or status
	wantonly. So ein mist. It was obvious. Mario, not a politician, was
	a major proponent in the Peace Pact. Why? To prepare his kingdom for
	his retirement. Therefore&hellip;&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry&rsquo;s
	stomach dropped. &ldquo;Oh no.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-There
	will be no one in position to stop our father, who will
	unquestionably be on board with us, no pun intended, once I present
	my scheme in a delectably different light.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	younger brother staggered backwards. &quot;Y-you can't be freaking
	serious!&quot; Impulsively he bolted down the observation deck, so
	blindly he forgot a third of the ship was ripped off. His feet
	screeched to a stop on the jagged edge. Looking down he saw the city
	hundreds of feet below, wavering as vertigo hit.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hands of
	a toad girl latched to his shell, pulling him back.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Don't
	be a baby! Come on.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thanks,
	but he still hated her, hopelessly grappling as she dragged him
	back. While Ludwig had a consultation with everyone conscious to
	hear it, she managed to push him below deck and secure the door with
	a spare oar. Lemmy noticed this, his face dropping.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	like your new plan, but was that necessary?&rdquo; he fumed. &ldquo;..And
	I just thought of something. I know we aren&rsquo;t worrying about
	Mario, but what about Luigi?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">In a
	private spot in Dr. Toadley&rsquo;s clinic, the lights were dimmed
	once the beeps and blips of the computers monitoring the body grew
	steady. X-ray scans were resoundingly normal, leaving the scar and
	the shock Luigi was in the only proof anything ever happened. He was
	on involuntary bed rest for twenty-four hours minimum. </font>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Feeling

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So no, he

	when he left.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi and
	Boo weren't around because Mario made it so for their protection.
	Peach castle attacks wasn't unheard of to residents, it was the
	eerie method and the person responsible , whose convoluted
	involvement was unexplainable without unraveling sordid details,
	screw ups and more, everything they'd been through since the game.
	All they'd kept manage to conceal was that Bowser was STILL in town
	freely and that Luigi didn't 'defeat' Zoo unscathed.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	gently sat on the bed's edge. &quot;If by any chance you hear me,
	don't worry little bro. I'm a broken record with that in my hubris,
	but this time I mean it. I think people are accepting that I can't
	control everything, friend or foe. It's not over and heck, it might
	get worse. When you spring right up from here though, you're going
	to be unstoppable, and I will guarantee that. </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He made
	the rest of it a note: Mushroom Flu- Read Luigi. Long ago, after all
	of Bowser's cupbears were run through, his in-house doc discovered
	the containment in food, like now. Only a stateless human doctor was
	willing to help. Doc might have notes on it. Couldn't get a name. We
	can discuss later.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	pulled the white covers up to his brother's neck and was out of
	there, bumping into a very impatient guest out in the lobby. Dr.
	Toadley allowed the red plumber to borrow some power tools, or
	whatever was close enough, and slap a couple of repairs on the Mach
	Bike. It was ready to go for him and-</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	handed over his hacked up helmet creation.. &quot;Wear this so you
	don't crack your skull open. Now where to?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Huffing
	derisively, Bowser tried the basic white commuter style headgear on.
	It was snug over his fat head, but the spots carved out for his
	horns lined up fine, and Mario was inwardly a little too proud of
	his guess work. &quot;The park.. Since when do I need a stupid
	helmet?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	poked his scaled chest. &quot;Since people like me make the bike
	safety statistics so scary, dummy. Didn't you ask in the first
	place?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	thought cha would whip up a cool one! -Uhg.. Thanks.. I guess!&quot;
	he groaned teasingly. His calloused hands slid across the nape of
	Mario's neck, settling on the shoulder opposite to him with a
	slightly heavy if thrilling weight. &quot;But seriously. Thanks. You
	could have had me in a pillory five times over by now, but you
	believed me right off.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	ignored the flash of heat on his face. Why his touch was psyching
	him out so much.. &quot;No problem.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Since
	when you can do that mechanic junk by the way? Forgot you're so
	handy!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Since
	always, not that you'd see it much. Heh. I'm not gonna repair enemy
	contraptions,&quot; he stuttered.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	stood off from him- finally. &quot;Duh. Guess I am a dummy..
	SOMETIMES! Keep that tool box smokin'!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That odd
	interaction over, they took a longer, bumpier, secluded route to the
	destination. Away from so many lamps, the stars and constellations
	stuck out, even though the fuchsia hadn't faded from the horizon.
	Mario remembered them regularly appearing so vast and staggeringly
	impressive years ago, before gradually losing it's luster. Now he
	was realizing what had actually changed during that time.</font></p>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">True to
	his word, Probabilly made the facility like new in a 'jiffy'. He'd
	cleaned, fixed the entrance doors, and even the wobbly furniture.
	Dr. Prof. had other issues anyway. Since expunging Mario and co, the
	competence of his doctors plunged deeper than the Underwhere. He
	could twirl his fingers in front of some of them without reaction.
	Fortunately for him, he needed no assistance for operation room one.
	Before him on the table was a huge lump under a blue towel. The

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Patient:
	Male. Pianta. 57. Name, so and so... He glossed over the chart, too
	old a habit to drop, though the information didn't matter for this

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ah. Dr.

Toadette
	rushed outside to board the bus-like shuttle driven by Sergeant
	Howie, officer #2 of Snifit Patrol, uncharacteristically allowed to
	escort them around. She was embarrassed enough over flooding the
	Birthday kart, and not realizing that Peach's at the time floating
	castle was blocking the cell towers, making her ranting at
	YoshiMobile useless, so she just wanted to do something right for
	once. For Peach to believe she was precocious again. ..Or look at
	her, cup her face and simply go 'job well done, dear'. That would be
	acceptable too.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Here

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
	examined the note, paling and unsubtly not letting Toadette see what
	that nurse wrote She almost wished she'd peeped. &quot;No. That is
	someone unrelated.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Darn.
	Toadette slumped beside Bucken-Berry in the same row, glued to the
	window as they zipped around town, about as freaked out.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The whomp

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He kept

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jelectro
	skidded behind MK East hospital, running onto the curb and bouncing
	onto the lawn in between the dumpsters. It was pitch black and next
	Kylie knew, she was thrown around, bashing her face against the
	middle console.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	pursuing officer they'd picked up along the way parked behind them,
	blowing a loud whistle. &quot;This is Snifit Patrol. Stop!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jelectro

	that noki ditched me! ..Well I did climb in his trunk but...&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Snifit
	Patrol enthusiastically pulled out a thick ticket book. &quot;Tell
	me more!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">As Kylie
	tried to avoid incriminating herself further, a purple bandit
	sporting fancy black Air Koopa sneakers and a boombox jaywalked onto
	the scene. He got close and deliberately blasted hip hop,
	distracting and drawing away the snufit. Jelectro winked at Kylie
	and tossed her his keys.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;It's
	all yours.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;So

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Only

	is your insurance that we'll have to rendezvous soon. Oui?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	hopped in, stalled for a second before muscle memory from her dad's
	old farm kicked in, and soon tore down Starman lane. Snifit Patrol
	terminated the pursuit quickly. He knew he wouldn't win. Or he was
	following that large, Bowser ship shaped, shadow moving around town.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The flags
	that survived were raised as Ludwig rode low and slow, creating a
	perfect view of their invasion. As easy as he located Toad Town
	park, lit by tiny mushroom shaped lights on the walking paths, his
	best landing attempt lopped off the head of a statue, crushed a
	jungle gym, and tipped over all portable toilets.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The Koopa
	King watching the entire thing was glad that was all they broke. As
	the dirt cloud cleared, he stomped alongside the hull and strained
	to examine every broken rivet. His eyes bulged at the extent of the
	damage, especially since it wasn't from this landing.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Vater,
	we were buffeted by a severe storm on the way, precipitation, a
	tornado, hail.. Other things.. It soars acceptably, I assure you!
	Additionally we are familiar with all events today. No need to
	recount.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	grumpily walked forward, forcing Ludwig and Lemmy to split. &quot;Good,
	cause I wasn't in the mood.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario in
	the darker fighterfly filled background caught Ludwig and Lemmy
	glancing at each other, mischievously. Iffy as it was starting to
	look, their presence was slapping him out of it. He rolled the bike
	over, introducing himself.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hey
	kids.. Both of you are how old already? Wow. I remember when you
	were crawling and..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Totally..
	Time files, ha ha,&quot; Lemmy said, bothering to chat back, unlike
	his brother. &quot;Can we wait a bit before takeoff? Think there's
	another storm on the coast.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	stood the bike. &quot;No worries. I'll watch for trouble.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;And
	I'll be on deck..&quot; From slightly farther away than they all
	thought Bowser would be listening, he climbed aboard via a bottom
	hatch, Ludwig trailing.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A moment
	later Peach gasped. The shuttle had arrived unannounced. Though she
	calmed over the warship, she behaved like Mario was invisible. &quot;We
	received a tip that our toads are here. Is there a mistake?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No,
	we DID. Come on!&quot; Lemmy kindly offered his hand.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	fought against interjecting there. Why wasn't he told? Just as he
	was about to follow Peach and Toadette, like it or not, Bucken-Berry
	crossed his path.<br/>
&quot;Mr. Mario, can we talk about
	something?&quot;</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The noki
	adopted a wandering tourist act and traversed the West ring,
	updating Agent 0069 with his smart watch. Upon reaching Room 26 he
	was greeted by Mitch's middle aged, tanned, slightly bloated, face.
	He had beady black eyes like his own, only mildly glazed from
	painkillers, vitriolic, and thick graying downturned eyebrows.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Why.
	Didn't. You. Catch. Him?? Did I not give you enough info?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;He's
	a boo, full blooded or not.&quot; Jelectro came right up on him,
	undaunted. &quot;And you shared too much information, like what
	you'd like to do to him if not for the age-gap. Bleh!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh,
	shut up. That was before he paralyzed me. He'll be back some way or
	another, but never mind. That sow, Peach asked for extra security
	and they'll be here any minute. Big mistake. Dr. Prof. will purge
	and get away scott free, like she did.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jelectro
	shifted his weight uncomfortably. &quot;What is this nonsense?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Toads
	had to be 'pure' once. Know how messed up that is? How is she
	related to Toadsworth then? Course it was a secret until I revealed
	it way back. Look, I know she's gradually changed stuff but, ha, I
	know what she's stock from. Really, everything here is built on so
	many lies, I've never even gotten to the bottom of it, dude..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Gripping
	the door handle, Dr. Professor paused outside, speaking what the
	noki was thinking. &quot;I don't think this was worth the hold up,
	and I'm doubting everything.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;It's
	legit. Lemme put ya on hold.&quot; The bandit agent dropped the
	phone from the rooftop workstation to text Jelectro for an answer.
	His boombox was on the opposite side of the helipads, currently
	occupying the ems workers as they danced to the drill beats. &quot;Tell
	ya what. We'll give you twenty-thou if you stop what chu doin and-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Goodbye
	prankster.&quot; Dr. Professor hung up and entered room 26. Hand on
	chin, he verified the vitals on the monitors, cross checking with a
	clipboard.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jelectro
	spied from the closet, behind bundles of white towels. The doctor
	cleared his throat. &quot;Mr. Mitch, how about I perform your
	scheduled operations tonight? Alright? Alright.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">When he
	edited Mitch's procedure chart to have 'Lobotomy', that was all
	Jelectro needed to jump out and blindsid the doctor, slamming him
	into the wall. The bump knocked tacked papers to the ground.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	am Detective Bond and you are under arrest for conspiracy, bribery,
	and unlawful procedures. Hands up!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Doctor
	Professor shot his arms upwards.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
	accepted a deal from a scoundrel posing as another hospital Why?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	doctor's visage contorted into a self satisfied smile. &quot;My,
	what are the odds of meeting two magikoopa-like-freaks in a day,
	boy? If you can't pick it from my brain, give up. I can wait aaaall
	day. Can you?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jelectro
	checked his watch. About that..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	intercom screeched for a moment, filled with static and distant
	screams from some conflict happening in the lobby. &quot;We have
	another invasion! All doctors on guard!&quot; Nass blared.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The stomp
	of heavy boots bounced off the hall outside. While his head was
	turned, the doctor slipped out of Jelectro's grip, wasting not one
	second to hurl himself shell first against the glass and out the
	window to escape. Baffled, the noki peered outside. He shuddered at
	the dark outlines, armored vehicles of the burly Mushroom Royal
	squad surrounding the hospital.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Under
	the bed, dude!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jelectro
	rushed to prop the door closed with a steel fold out chair that was
	down there. That is what he meant wasn't it. A half second later,
	there was a heavy thunk as a guard failed to kick it in. The noki
	backed away.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No,
	you coulda hid. They don't have poochys with em- oh forget.. Unprop
	it again on one. The elevator will be clear. Good luck. Don't die.
	Now swing it open in five.. Four...&quot;</font></p>

	Jelectro pulled the chair away, allowing three guards to charge in
	and trip over each other. Jelectro climbed over the pile up and
	found the way clear as Mitch cued. He rode up three floors to the
	helipads and found 0069 peering over the edge of the parapet.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Screw
	that money, 0064. I'm outta here.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Andrew
	was 'gangsta' enough to jump without scaling gear. He was HQ's
	street guy for a reason. Jelectro wasn't though, call it vanity to
	protect his pretty face, or call it him hearing the crunch of the
	bandit a few seconds later. He let the black spotted, armor wearing
	toads get him with no worries. He'd broken out of the local jail
	countless times. His sunglasses were taken, and he saw the writing
	on the tanks better. The noki worried then.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
	was eager to break free from the cramped spiral staircase leading up
	the airship&rsquo;s four decks. She kept on Peach&rsquo;s heels
	until, muffled by thick walls, she thought she heard someone
	cackling. She had it. She would beg Peach to go back, stop being
	prickly and just send Mario in. Just as a friend, not a hero thing.
	She ran out of time. The observation deck was in appalling
	condition. Debris was hurled everywhere, the ship had no sails left,
	and the floorboards had treacherous gaps to avoid. The poor
	condition ran all the way to the control panels at the helm. Bowser,
	Ludwig, and Kamek, with much grumbling involved, were busy tinkering
	with sparkling wires sprouting from the tarnished metal boxes.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
	looked to her left. The princess was missing! Her palpitations
	resided. Peach had traveled with familiarity to a rusty compartment
	door leading deeper into the ship where Wendy stood around. The
	koopaling princess pushed it open, bored like. Out came a young
	toad, orange, dorky, and sorta cute, also in a wrinkled nurse
	outfit.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Nass
	Toad's daughter? You joined my castle today?&quot; Peach asked.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Emery did
	a curtsy. &quot;Yep!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
	obviously had much more to inquire about, considering her other
	staff purported that the new recruit was 'male', but she had to
	press another matter. &quot;And Toadsworth?&quot;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His
	case is kinda sensitive. Some privacy?&rdquo; Lemmy made Toadette
	jump. &ldquo;Maybe wait off board.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	so-called childish koopaling towered over her while on his green
	ball and ran her off deck, back into the spooky spiral staircase.
	She protested as the door slammed shut in her face. She pulled on
	the handle. It didn&rsquo;t bulge. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario led
	the blue toad off to the wooden picnic tables, keeping within view
	of the airship. Bucken-Berry was, with no embellishment, his bravest
	warrior in adventures, his biggest fan, and in general not a typical
	blue toad. Now he sat across from him, the flame behind his eyes
	gone.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;What
	happened at the castle's not your fault.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He wiped
	his nose with his sleeve. &quot;You know how my origin story goes. I
	was a sole survivor in Toadwood Forest, so while in orphanage, I
	thought- this has to mean something. -Or I going to make it mean
	something. I already survived that alien stuff, so if I train and
	get strong enough, not only would I survive more impossible stuff,
	I'd never lose anyone again. I was still a kid then. I know that's
	not realistic, but.. they were saying Ala-Gold has serious brain
	damage. This might have been my last day with him around, and I was
	a complete dick. Nothing I did mattered far as the other stuff. Why
	am I still doing this?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	held his shoulder firmly. &quot;Bucken-Berry, the things you love
	</font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">will
	hurt</font></em> <font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">at
	some point. Fearing failure doesn't mean you should quit.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The blue
	toad looked at him frankly. &quot;But why did you?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario let
	go, rattled enough to divert to the black jagged outline of the
	airship, detecting his own tears welling up.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;It
	wasn't what you wanted to do...?&quot; Bucken-Berry then tacked on,
	the red plumber's actual name few knew.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario's
	gaze snapped back. &quot;..It's technically never what I wanted to
	do. It was what someone needed to do. We still need that. So,
	whatever you decide, be sure about it.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
	squinted as someone in the park shined a dazzlingly bright torch all
	over. The beam settled on their picnic table, like a figure of
	authority catching rascally teens at night. The red plumber supposed
	their moment just then was 'intimate', but not like that..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Panting,
	Snifit Patrol lowered the beam. &quot;I was tracking that airship
	all over town, I even let my quota drop to keep up.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;In
	peace, Sumeet. Now could you please..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Peace?
	Mr. Mario, they had their Bowser Flag raised the entire time!&quot;</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Noooo!&quot;
	Peach dropped to her knees before Toadsworth's bruised, bloodied,
	and unconscious body. A tattered Bowser Flag was draped over him, as
	if symbolically claiming that the Koopa Troop, fractured as it was,
	succeeded in claiming him. She was in a terrible position, and she
	placed herself there!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;That
	was my touch. I'm Bowser's new toad actually!&quot; Emery didn't
	know why she hadn't done this sooner. Watching Peach squirm was fun.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Do
	not get ahead Miss Toady, but affirmative, she contributed greatly,
	one of our many pawns as we terrorized you and your society all
	day!&quot; Ludwig declared maniacally, looming over the princess.
	&quot;No here's a synopsis as scattered as your plebeian newspapers.
	Sam and Slam drove into town to infect the participants of your
	tennis game. The Koopa Troop thus take full responsibility for the
	tragedies of today: the rapid illness of your friends, the mushroom
	citizens, AND the destruction of your hideous castle! Say good bye
	to your backwards kingdom, because you WILL come with us.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	whipped around so quickly the wheel spun, rotating the ship on the
	ground and into adjacent trees. &quot;What??&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	gave a salute. &quot;Vater, I concocted this scheme for your central
	purpose. (Mostly) Forget go-karting with that Mario. The princess is
	just. Right. There!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No, not
	anymore. Peach jumped into the part of the ship torn off, knowing
	she'd land in an open room with bench seating. She dashed out and
	down a deck, into a cramped corridor for ammo storage. It had
	occupants among the cannons lining the walls, like unsightly things
	stuffed away, demented koopalings, spinning in place, laughing,
	drooling.. Pale, she turned back, losing her footing when abrupt
	g-forces knocked her around and threw her against the nearest
	porthole- and into Toadette's screaming face on the other side. The
	airship lifting launched the steward out of the stair shaft and
	outside, where she clung to the flapped open exit door for dear
	life.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
	spotted a rivet tool hung up in the room for the barrels within.
	Clash! The princess shielded herself amidst the shower of glass
	shards. She brushed off the cuts on her arms and lunged half her
	body out, dropping her personal items to do so. Their hands graced
	for a fraction of a second. Breathlessly she watched her toad
	plunge.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Thank
	the stars.. Mario and her guard Bucken-Berry were directly below.
	She could scope out the entire park though with their altitude. A
	sudden roll stopped her thoughts, the barrels about to crush her.
	Someone tugged her out of the way before she was pinned. She tumbled
	into a koopaling, Larry. She barely registered it, leaping onto her
	feet again and running down a corridor. He stopped her again.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Give
	it up,&quot; he muttered.</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Low to
	the ground, the fiery blasts from the engines held them at bay. As
	the ship rose with difficulty, it was safe to gather beneath. Mario
	pointed to a pink toad hanging precariously from an unsecured ground
	level door. The decrepit Doomship had an ear piercing backfire and
	shook the person off.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bucken-Berry
	dove forward and caught Toadette before she spat on the ground. She
	continued to hyperventilate in his sturdy grasp as he repeated,
	&quot;Baby, I got you..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach's
	parcel plummeted as well, shedding its contents in the sky, her
	white papers like confetti around the city block. Snifit Patrol
	commanded his sergeant to collect whatever they were, and then
	opened a metal gun case with a super scope in it.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No!&quot;
	The plumber shut it with his boot. &quot;That type of ship explodes
	very easy. I'll do something else.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He tried
	to call Bowser. That's how it started, it's how it would end if he
	could swipe his pattern lock with his nerves. It took ten tries. The
	lawn sprinkler system had cut on next to him and he hadn't noticed
	until the wind hit his drenched body.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Then the
	phone rang him first.</font></p>

	stop&hellip; yeah yeah It&rsquo;s super old tech whatcha gonna do
	about..What?? We&rsquo;re hitting some clouds. Gotta go, can&rsquo;t
	hear ya.&rdquo; The Koopa King shut his dumbphone. A bead of sweat
	rolled off his forehead onto the barrage of controls in front of
	him, a high voltage wire left exposed from their patch-up job
	sparking a few times before another fuse popped.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kamek, co
	navigator, reset the circuit, glaring warily at his step-son. &ldquo;Why
	waste time with that pest, Lord Bowser?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lay
	off, gramps. I got this&hellip; Get!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Following
	the northerly pointed needle on the compass, Bowser cruised along.
	There were no markers anywhere, only the glint of water bodies as
	they sailed over sparsely populated kingdoms, tantamount to flying
	in a void at moments. He&rsquo;d coaxed the airship to be steady,
	but the Koopa King felt his stomach churn despite that. Fresher air
	away from the cities really let him reflect. It smacked him bluntly
	that an impulsive primitive side got him to this point, running off
	with captives after breaking a sworn oath. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Or.. like
	his eldest son, he could play the plausible deniability game! He
	stopped slumping for the first time. Peach was tucked away somewhere
	in the maze-like layout, so they just didn&rsquo;t see her onboard
	until they&rsquo;d crossed the six kingdoms between the Mushroom
	Kingdom and Dark Land. What if he did go through with it? His union
	with Peach wouldn't &lsquo;mean&rsquo; anything, it was just part of
	tyranny. Bowser could cure her citizens too since that part of the
	scheme was already fulfilled. See? He wasn't heartless. Once he made
	her kingdom and her allies fold under his will, he and that plumber
	would be free to do whatever they wanted.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There,
	everything WAS under control!</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That high
	wore off with the sheer uneventfulness of the rest of the journey.
	Bowser was half asleep crossing his kingdom&rsquo;s border. Was his
	castle not the sole structure on the property for acres, he might
	have missed it honestly. He only fully awoke after the rough touch
	down and forty degree roll, followed by the stampede of occupants
	hopping overboard. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Stop
	stop stop!!&rdquo; From the railings he watched one by one their
	spiked shells tremble, yards away from the castle's back door.
	&ldquo;Forgetting something???&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After an
	arduous search they weren&rsquo;t, repossessing Peach from her
	pantry hiding spot. How she&rsquo;d discovered a section of the
	doomship even they&rsquo;d forgotten about, they didn&rsquo;t know.
	Wendy and Lemmy together took her in, typically reserved for Roy or
	Morton, but they were &lsquo;feeling better, but still not well&rsquo;
	along with Iggy. Upon asking why, lips sealed. The princess wailed
	the entire time, putting on a show that would have attracted a crowd
	at any other hour in their stone castle corridors, gratingly wishing
	for the stars to save her. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Walking
	alongside as she was escorted to her deluxe holding room, Bowser
	stuffed his ears. That was the problem with them, sitting around
	waiting for providence to do it all! Everything handed over on
	silver platters! At least Toadsworth was tolerable, his barely
	conscious body carried down to the dungeon without incident..</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Please
	hire a professional planner for once, Vater. I shall elaborate in
	due time, but I fear I may be unable to conduct the orchestra.&quot;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	didn&rsquo;t want cha to.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Excuse

	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	love your tunes but who wants a migraine on their wedding day?? If I
	really do this thing...&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	marched up and down the red carpeted stone corridors. Prisoners were
	secured, their family were scattered about, likely rummaging in a
	kitchen, and his Troop, aside from dedicated watchers, were settled
	in bed if they knew what was good for them. Father and son had no
	destination at the moment, simply a shared or inherited habit of
	pacing aimlessly. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
	cannot hold the princess for very long without a formal decision,&rdquo;
	Ludwig replied vaguely. &ldquo;Why do you dither?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Because!&rdquo;
	Bowser paused and huffed coincidentally at the dusty lapis lazuli
	bust of his brother, the fleshly version of him unseen since the
	assassination of father King Morton. His departure was so ill-timed
	and repugnant, no one dared to utter his name anymore. &ldquo;Just
	lemme figure it out. I&rsquo;ll have an answer by tomorrow, okay??
	Why Mushroom Flu anyway? Was it just to scare them or..&rdquo; he
	trailed.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	benignly planted himself at the other side of the seven foot tall
	structure. &ldquo;A tool to force submission firstly, and to
	establish a ransome arrangement, that is if the princess did not
	voluntarily place herself in our clutches. I discovered detailed
	notes on it while cleaning out old chests and filed it away until a
	time when I needed to transcend our basic kidnapping plots.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And
	why did ya?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">To
	impress the&hellip; never mind, I beg. It is purposeless to enmesh
	you or anyone else when nothing is solidified,&rdquo; he explained
	stiffly. &ldquo;By the way, the author of the notebook was Dr.
	Mario.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His
	father stared blankly. Ludwig followed his gaze to the opposite wall
	of the hall, where dozens of hand painted portraits of notable
	Darklandian figures were hung. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...Vater?
	There is no relevance to your rival. &lsquo;Mario&rsquo; is a
	surname.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Still
	nothing.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	estimated he could be staring intensely at Princess Keuxis reigning
	50 B.C.E to only 35, primadonna who conscripted soldiers for stage
	plays, dying from laughter at their abominable acting skills. Or
	Keschylus 1604 to 1612, his reign terminating when a paratroopa made
	an emergency landing- on his head. That didn&rsquo;t bode well&hellip;
	Or glutinous Koopa A. Frederick, king from 1300 to 1336, whose
	digestive system failed after too many.. mushrooms.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...Vater!!&rdquo;
	His echo bounced around the room.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	snapped his way. &ldquo;G-good night. Alright?...Get!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	saluted and left him to trek to his bedroom alone. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A sentry
	hovered outside the giant iron throne room door, a lakitu with
	balaclava atop a darkened cloud. &ldquo;Sentry #11 reporting. Your
	time cards are in order now. We&rsquo;ve accounted for all minions
	that deserted this morning, deceased or not. We can send undercover
	goons to recover the bodies by 00:40 in the morning. We haven&rsquo;t
	yet nailed the freak responsible, but we made sure he ain&rsquo;t
	returning home, boss..&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	groggily nodded along. &ldquo;For security, lift both bridges
	tonight. That&rsquo;s an order.&rdquo; He brushed past him, eager to
	jump in bed.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
	spoofed an instant message from one of Kammy&rsquo;s girlfriends to
	draw the crone away from the special room. Designated for holding
	princesses, it differed from the dungeons in that it had a real bed
	with a canopy, a vanity set, and a barred window with a great view
	of all of the lava outdoors. He tip-toeed around in the warm candle
	light, evading the usual tattletales stationed around his royal
	home. After peeking around the last corner before the staircase that
	led up the spire, he ducked back-</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The girl
	cupped her hand over her mouth. &ldquo;Tanner, right? Dude, you
	won&rsquo;t report that?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Pro

	across his exposed tanned neck. &ldquo;This guy is outta this world.
	He&rsquo;s like the best illusionist, only better because it&rsquo;s
	real. He&rsquo;s just hiding for tonight at so and so..&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah

	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Wait

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
	kneeled over, nauseated overhearing them talk about the guy the
	Troop were hunting for tonight, burning down his cabin in the
	village next door over in the process. Larry could spill this new
	intel and rebuild his sullied reputation, but heck-to-the-no!! The
	janitor had done some bad things to their soldiers unabashedly, but
	by destroying the castle and displacing the princess he was
	blatantly the only reason his brother could salvage the kidnap. To
	him it was no different than when the koopalings were tasked to
	throw hoards of baddies at the Mario Bros on any given day, knowing
	full well some might not make it back. No one was mourning losses.
	The acceptance of collateral was so ingrained in their culture, the
	real problem the Troop, specifically Ludwig, had with that guy was
	revolting.</font></p>

	continued, &ldquo;Oh I forgot ha ha.. here.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Emery
	accepted the travel voucher, blushing. &quot;Thanks. Yeah, enough of
	that stuff. I can stay anywhere in Neo Bowser City with this?&quot;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">If
	not owned by the warlords, totally. My friend and I did it a lot
	before I was promoted full time. Ha ha..&quot;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Attention
	please, this is a secured area UNFIT for tours on behalf of
	uninitiated operatives such as Miss Toady!&rdquo; Ludwig ran up on
	both with an electronic torch illuminating their stunned faces.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
	cursed silently. Ludwig had already pardoned his earlier rebellion
	in exchange for his computer. Another infraction might take away
	something else dear, like his headphones. He backed off, for then..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Meanwhile.
	Tanner saluted, letting his spear clash to the ground in a klutzy
	manner.. &ldquo;Sir! Sorry for breaching a sector.. I umm, got
	carried away welcoming our guest into the troop and providing
	accommodation in the city.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	mellowed somewhat. That saved him from the tears that would likely
	erupt from her if he disclosed that the castle had no vacancy
	outside the dungeons and Junior&rsquo;s empty pet pens. &ldquo;Very
	well. Good night.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	commander entered his sanctuary, plopped down at his writing desk,
	twiddled his gold pen, and crossed one leg over the other. The
	journal destined to contain his manifesto remained empty, the same
	one that had to be completed to impress the Elders of the National
	Villain Counsel. What defined &lsquo;Ludwig Von Koopa&rsquo;? What
	was his purpose? </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	decided on </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Love
	and War.</font></em></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Love: Not
	a fabrication, genuinely! -Also not of a romantic sort as he
	supposed he wasn't &lsquo;attracted&rsquo; to anyone at the moment,
	not lasciviously. Intellectually he may have crushed on a few
	professors at college, but.. So anyway familial love was real too,
	but he digressed. It was more aptly described as a passion for
	music, science, technology- also the grittier ones, history,
	politics, and social studies, leading to-</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">War: An
	ugly necessity, for there was much to fight for. As long as the
	Mushroom Kingdom held dominance, people like him had a duty to
	dismantle it. Facing his bed, so that it was the first thing he saw
	every morning, was a wall filled with his stockpile of battle
	metals, a spot in the middle cleared for what could soon hold the
	most prestigious yet if he reported his success to the Counsel. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Five
	pages in, it was time for a stretch and diversion to other projects.
	Better late than never combing over all the yellowed pages of the
	&ldquo;Ex Spatio Obiecti Specialem Lexicon&rdquo; from his library.
	The Mushoomy star centered faith was a 'speciest and nationalistic
	concept' for a certainty, but there was validity he could not deny
	in recognizing and respecting their power, as their unwitting
	utilization ranged from bizarre effects. Portals to other realms,
	reality-warping.. There was another &lsquo;R&rsquo; thing it did,
	but he&rsquo;d need to locate his bookmark on it again. After
	straining a while over small text, he remembered he had something
	else less bookish but far more conclusive to study. Iggy&rsquo;s
	video capture was saved on Larry&rsquo;s laptop!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	battery was drained. He found himself awkwardly tethered to the
	outlet behind his piano when the wide screen snapped down on his
	fingers. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Ouch!
	Bl&ouml;der Dell X-&rsquo;POS&rsquo;&hellip;&quot; He readjusted the
	broken hinge. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	footage was fuzzy and unrecognizable. He leaned in until the
	computer buzzed and powered off. He sneezed. An influx of particles
	he dismissed as dust agitated from under the keys. A coughing fit
	overtook him as the air grew dense. No telling what crud
	Larry...This wasn&rsquo;t normal.. Something very dark and acidic
	steadily spilled from the battery compartment , pooling on top of
	his ornate rug, solidifying and clumping in spots that writhed. He
	scrambled to his feet, tripping over his bench. It covered his
	entire room now, molding over each and every shape He was surrounded
	and seared as some of it inched onto his toes.</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yippee..We
	found out why he didn&rsquo;t answer&hellip; Oh God, I forget he
	weighs as much as a thwomp.. Help!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Two
	people close by grunted for a while. Ludwig felt something
	plush-like give under him. His crusted over eyelids cracked open and
	he lay on his made up king sized bed. Leaning up, the first
	inclination was to be quite hot witnessing his trusted adjutants
	sneaking out at 11:55 PM, but a partition of his memory was blotted
	out completely and that was far more unsettling. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The two
	koopalings continued obliviously, &ldquo;We should have used my
	Movematic2000 v.4 Alpha. Up to four tons of lift with her built-in
	gravitational distortion.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	last toy of yours we used killed somebody today, even though you
	swore it was just a prop! And how is that a &lsquo;she&rsquo;?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Lemmy-sama,
	because she told me herself and she'd know!&quot; Iggy giggled.
	&quot;Besides prop and nonlethal are not mutual. Mrs. Mover however
	is never dangerous- if set at less than medium power.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
	pivoted around on his ball. &ldquo;-Oh, whoops. Hey your door was
	open and you were all strung out next to this exploded thingy.&rdquo;
	He dropped the corroded aluminum shell of the notebook next to
	Ludwig. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy
	hastily strapped on a flat backpack. It was apparent then he was
	paler and rolling around atypically on a two wheel balance scooter.
	&ldquo;Annnd we gotta bounce. When I blacked out today I missed the

	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Halt.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
	shuddered in his doorway.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	will accompany you all,&rdquo; Ludwig slid out of bed, light headed.
	Maybe a Turtle Tea from the 24-hour bistro not far from there would
	help him through the rest of the night. He struggled back and forth
	on whether to turn back when, as his feet left the bridge of Bowser
	Castle, there was a loud grinding noise. The drawbridge raised
	behind him, leaving the crevice that contained lava.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It was 12
	AM and the decision was made for him.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Deep in
	the forest, under the canopy of the hardwood trees, items plunked on
	the soft dirt. The floating figure scanned the various shapes
	partially hidden under the brush the best he could, adjusting his
	glasses repeatedly as they slid downwards. If he wasn&rsquo;t so
	prone to dissipation and wasting his talents, culminating into being
	run off everytime he settled somewhere, he may have seen an
	optometrist by now. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There was
	a letter to his brother living his boring life somewhere in Special
	World, goaded on by what his father said on the back of that old
	photo. There was a map of Neo Bowser City, not living here long
	enough to know the layout. His prized antique bell was glowing in
	the corner of his eye, mildly worrisome-like. There was one other
	time when it had done that. He was a teen, used it for some sick fun
	for a spat, then some &lsquo;Evil Artifact Busters&rsquo; or
	something raided his family&rsquo;s home and said they&rsquo;d
	dispose of it off in another kingdom&hellip; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Last on
	the checklist was an envelope postmarked Bowser Castle, ATTN: 'Guard
	Tanner', containing a short message and a morbid souvenir from his
	adventures like the only friend liked so much, a Lexus emblem from a
	certain crash today. He sniffed a bit. He'd miss him for a while. Or
	miss pulling the koopatrol into trouble rather. Great (fall) guy.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Securing
	the items in a knapsack, the only thing he was able to grab before
	those losers surrounded his cabin, he was ready to go hunt down two
	sumo bros.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Three
	young adult koopalings traversed on foot through the thick brambles
	of the woodlands between them and Neo Bowser City. Ludwig
	inadvertently made it so when he siphoned all the fuel from the
	Troop&rsquo;s vehicles this morning when the minions first snuck
	off. He would suppose their plebeian method could be for stealth,
	but his brothers did not appear to be worried so-</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-We
	should get King Dad into that series! He&rsquo;ll love the locations
	they use for the epic battles. What if he&rsquo;s motivated to
	switch the castle layout sometimes? He won&rsquo;t be defeated so
	much due to players memorizing their button presses and speeding
	through his levels in record times!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Quit
	that 'life is a videogame' fan-theory stuff,&quot; Lemmy laughed.
	&quot;So, you brought the credit card, right?&quot; He cautiously
	glanced over his shoulder, where Ludwig trailed grumpily and got
	whacked repeatedly by branches and twigs.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
	didn't think he would pay for such drivel, did they?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy dug
	in the backpack. &quot;I'll write a check!.. Or not because. Darn
	it. Sam and Slam made an overdraft and I knew that.. Gosh, I'm just
	so thrown off since that blackout thing..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	quickly inserted himself in between them. &quot;Their work today was
	worth 500 coins. You did not deplete your account, did you Ignatius?
	Are you in competition with Wendy?!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy
	shrugged it off with equanimity. &quot;More like, I have sniffling
	friends, hahaha..'&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;We
	cannot permit that! I knew they were mendacious when they
	overcharged for services the last time. Larry's hard drive upgrade
	last month was not a terabyte NVMe module as billed, but an
	antediluvian SATA based chip, a ruse that would mislead and placate
	anyone but I, who reexamined the specifications tonight, before it
	malfunctioned that is, sometime before your intrusion-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Why
	were you on Larry's, erm, kinda gross laptop anyway?&quot; Lemmy cut
	in over the gobbledygook.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;For
	the footage from Peach's castle. Some mythical object is
	hypothetically the origin of what we encountered there.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Indeed
	I am a proponent of secular Kingly Law Lemmy, but not a Philistine
	either. This matter should be distinguished as what I seek may NOT

	indoctrinated to believe they have unequal value regarding, but a
	seedier sort-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
	rolled his eyes.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He sighed
	and gestured ahead in an overly dramatic way. &quot;Fine! Class is
	dismissed. There is your destination, ravaged by soporific nerds!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Deeper
	into the Badlands, territories not under KT control flourished into
	smaller villages and in this case 'respectable' modern cities.
	Play-N-Tirade was a small dome shaped shop on the street corner of
	road #673, koopas crowding into it and leaving with shopping bags.
	The chaotic city beyond it was dazzlingly lit, sky rises sprouting
	from otherwise barren red soil and armored vehicles whipping and
	gliding around tight curves.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His
	brothers slipped on oversized space helmets, Cowboy Boom Boom merch,
	to shroud their identity. Ludwig had no such preparation, and upon
	seeing the crowd he knew squeezing inside among the grease and
	various body odors and trying to confront the Sumo Bros over money
	was unideal anyway.. Since he knew where to find them another day,
	the commander bypassed the storefront, windows stuffed with lively
	colorful merch from popular video-games and shows. He covered his
	blue hair with a promotional flier, walking a block to the
	&lsquo;Eat.Drink.WiiConnect24&rsquo; shop. The pedestrians and
	migrants were rougher than he remembered, but he was armed.. He made
	it in and out with some tea. Traveling back to the game store
	someone stopped him on the slippery sidewalk.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	owner&rsquo;s in?&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	blinked a few times. &ldquo;Unaware.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	stranger wiped the rain off his glasses. During that split second
	Ludwig found them familiar. That person and entered the
	Play-N-Tirade, leaving near instantaneously and vanishing into the
	fog. Enlivened by caffeine, the commander became more aware of what
	had subtly been an irritant since waking up on his bed. It started
	with dizziness, then he saw something inside the moodily lit bistro.
	A persistent afterimage was burnt in his vision, a faint geometric
	shape, very erratic, with an uncountable amount of angles to it,
	sharp in every direction. He stopped sipping the beverage as his
	vision blacked out, as if suffering from orthostatic hypotension,
	which he was not susceptible to normally. He feared he would
	collapse in the street when-</font></p>

	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And?&rdquo;
	Lemmy&rsquo;s smile flattened, adjusting the cheap umbrella that
	kept turning inside out. &ldquo;Okay we&rsquo;ll save it for later.&rdquo;
	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He knew
	it shouldn&rsquo;t have taken Ludwig popping off over this to get
	him to notice Iggy&rsquo;s problem, guilty he&rsquo;d absently
	juggled, sometimes literally, his Troop secretary duties, his
	performances at the Emerald Circus, and what little personal time he
	had left until now. His little brother had also exuded all of his
	enthusiasm during their brawl for a copy of Princess Parlor, so now,
	despite not using his legs, he was plainly exhausted. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy.
	We gotta get him up somehow. He&rsquo;s sleepwalked a million miles
	away and we&rsquo;re gonna get in like so much more trouble than we
	already are!!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...Don&rsquo;t

	castle&rsquo;s moat.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That&rsquo;s
	not what I mean. Oh wait, maybe he&rsquo;s done?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig&rsquo;s
	body ceased its stilted gait before what appeared to be an abandoned
	mini-fortress, imperturbably soaking wet from the storm that raged
	since Lemmy and Iggy left the shop in time to spot him wandering
	off. He would walk and not speak crossing over all terrain, and even
	a shallow stream. He went on the move again, approaching the
	entrance.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	teenager stalking the tallest spire of Bowser Castle wanted to send
	his fist through a wall. Kammy was stationed once again outside the
	deluxe holding room. When he snuck back downstairs a white light
	bled from underneath the kitchen door. Digging in the refrigerator
	secretly was impossible even for him, for this room in the center of
	the castle was minuscule, perhaps even by commoner&rsquo;s
	standards, to discourage goofing off. He poked his head in. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	see ya, son..&rdquo; Bowser kicked it shut, sipping from a glass of
	milk. His jagged shadow flickered on the wall of spices and other
	materials from the candle light.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
	dragged himself in.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hand
	this to old hag for me, then GET TO BED!!!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Cleaning
	out his ears, Larry examined the document addressed to Peach. He
	diverted swiftly to his room to grab from under his bed a pad of
	stationary that matched his father&rsquo;s. He wondered when the
	trade he&rsquo;d made with Morton for it, in exchange for a record
	player, would pay off. He was missing the correct writing utensil
	and knew where to acquire one, walking down the corridor of
	koopaling bedrooms:</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Morton&rsquo;s
	door appeared solid steel, only he knew it was actually wooden with
	mismatched plates glued on the outside. Being such, sound went right
	through it, only tonight there was none. Wendy&rsquo;s door was
	gold-trimmed smoky glass, the latest trend. One could not spy
	however, due to her layout and the various weaved dividers she
	shifted around during redecorations. Iggy&rsquo;s was skewed,
	something he meant to fix at some point, with a &lsquo;Koopa Ball Z&rsquo;
	banner taped to it. No chemical smell, so they were safe- for now.
	Roy&rsquo;s was legitimately made of dull iron too heavy for most of
	them to push, sound proof with five chains and locks shut up for the
	night. Lemmy&rsquo;s was bare and plain, almost too much, though the
	zany interior made up for it. At last, he reached Ludwig&rsquo;s
	room, with an old expertly restored bronze palace door plucked from
	the first fortress he ever conquered. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Picking
	the lock and stepping in, he blew a gasket at what was left of his
	laptop. He angrily snatched a fountain pen from the writing drawer
	and stomped out. Since the drawbridge was raised, Ludwig must be
	hanging around somewhere, ready to make his life miserable. -Okay,
	make an adjustment. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Psst,&rdquo;
	he called to Tanner, guarding the hall that lead to the stairs. When
	the koopatrol came over he whispered. &ldquo;Yo, dad made me a fetch
	boy but I&rsquo;m tired. You do it. Pass whatever I give ya on to
	granny-janny, and give me whatever she hands back. I know you know
	about a certain dark boo. I ain&rsquo;t gonna rat if you help me
	out.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	flushed. &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Shhh!!!
	Just do it.&rdquo; He shoved the rolled note into his gauntlet and
	watched the koopatrol hustle up the long spiral staircase up.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
	waited at the bottom. Beneath that bravado just then, he was about
	to suffocate, wondering if the princess would be receptive. He&rsquo;d
	copied his father&rsquo;s signature headers for formal documents,
	just in case they peeped, but in the rest of the note, written
	meticulously in cursive (as Bowser wrote contrary to popular belief.
	Proper cursive was in fact how he picked up the English language way
	back when) he told her everything he couldn&rsquo;t when he saved
	her from the barrels in the airship. Basically he vented about
	everything so far, especially how if Mario was living his &lsquo;truth&rsquo;
	with a billion people watching him, he could too.</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sir!&rdquo;
	Tanner handed over another note. It was in the thin rule paper kept
	in the holding room. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thanks.
	Whatever.&rdquo; Larry cooly strolled far enough before checking it.
	She thanked him. Called him a kind soul, knowing he had something
	like that to say when he&rsquo;d choked up earlier and cried with
	her. The stars were with her- and him. She was calm now, more
	worried for Toadsworth. She&rsquo;d dread this, suspecting Bowser
	couldn&rsquo;t change his tune even for Mario. She also told him to
	not be so rigid and think more about his principles, mystifying him.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He wrote
	back, compelled to even if it cast suspicion, and passed it to
	Tanner, hiding his sweating. The koopatrol had a flash of weariness
	before obeying the order and sending another note up the spire
	again. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Even
	quicker than last time, Tanner returned with a reply. This went on a
	few times, Larry imploring her to clarify which she refused. On the
	sixth round Tanner was worn but amiable, and Kammy&rsquo;s faint
	giggles seemed to curl down the staircase and reach them both.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well that
	was confirmation their imagination was dancing wildly at what Peach
	and &lsquo;Bowser&rsquo; might be saying. Larry flushed, more so
	when he discovered he&rsquo;d worn her down.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She said
	verbatim, </font><em>&ldquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You,
	dear, remind me of a point in my life where I was determined to
	evolve from the sort of &lsquo;thinking&rsquo; my predecessor had,
	only I had no precedent. I settled for &lsquo;completely opposite of
	everything I knew&rsquo;. I cannot speak for you, but for me, that
	was not the wisest choice, for I learned that that person&rsquo; in
	my life who was wrong about many things was not about everything.
	Sorting through that will take longer than one night.&rdquo;</font></em></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It was
	far past early morning now, so if he slept on it maybe he&rsquo;d
	get her point.. The koopaling swiped the junk off his bed and slid
	under the covers, hearing some paper crinkle. For fun, he brought
	out the original note from Bowser and unfolded it.</font></p>
	<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">This
	is an official declaration from King Bowser Koopa to Princess Peach
	Toadstool. I was going to wait until Junior was home from camp for
	this announcement, but it&rsquo;s no use. He can&rsquo;t read this
	anyway. They don&rsquo;t teach this style in school anymore. We both
	know that Mario forfeit his obligation to save you and Luigi is on
	the mends so, I have decided that, since you&rsquo;re stuck here
	anyway, we might as well get hitched!&rdquo;</font></em> 
	</p>
	<hr/>

	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luddy,
	stop!! What are you-&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Their
	brother barged into the dilapidated stone structure. A scratchy low
	voice from inside yelled incoherently, a person awakening inside.
	The brothers rushed into the arch of the doorway and into the square
	concrete room, roof leaking in one corner and the person Ludwig was
	confronting in the other. Lemmy&rsquo;s jaw dropped a little,
	knowing Zoo Diddley- at least professionally. If this is what his
	brother was after, he deserved to be caught. He used their shared
	profession to get hired quickly this summer, only to turn out to be
	a mook murderer. The only source of light was a curious thing on the
	floor next to a glasses case, a bell that glowed a yellow color.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bro,
	I was leaving- I wasn&rsquo;t uh- those guys weren&rsquo;t that
	loyal to you anyway-&rdquo; the dark boo sputtered. &ldquo;Really,
	almost every one of them hated your guts. Why you think they
	skipped-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	command you to hand over the bell,&rdquo; Ludwig droned.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That's
	what this about?? No way!!!&rdquo; The boo took a deep breath,
	bridling himself. &ldquo;Listen bro. I know you&rsquo;re a rich
	prick- okay sorry, but.. It&rsquo;s the only thing left from my
	childhood home and it was stolen from me before. Last week, I dunno
	how, it just showed up in a thrift store while I was traveling. So-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	repeated the command, same cadence and all. Lemmy stared a hole in
	the back of his head, finding that material thing odious to focus
	on. A lump however formed in his throat as Ludwig reached for a
	holster on his side. He revealed a borrowed replica firearm from the
	anime show &lsquo;Cowboy Boom Boom&rsquo;.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy
	lurched forward, taking wobbly steps off his scooter., &ldquo;Careful!!!
	That&rsquo;s another one with real laser action!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Before
	the lanky nerd reached for his right arm, the &lsquo;toy&rsquo;
	triggered, blasting the wall spectacularly. Bricks crumbled,
	revealing a hole outside. Zoo fled, phasing through the walls. His
	ears rang. His left side stung severely as the rain pelted him. He
	knew he was nicked by the laser or shrapnel, stumbling around in the
	forest. He&rsquo;d mailed his letters so there should be two things
	on him now, but there was only one. He&rsquo;d left his glasses. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	paused at a fork in the road. Squinting, both were labeled&hellip;screw
	it, he couldn't tell.. Lemmy and Iggy kept wailing after Ludwig
	behind him. He made a choice down the right path, bumping into trees
	and getting snipped by nipper plants along the way. The rain let up
	as it led into a clearing overlooking the neighboring kingdom. The
	dark boo collapsed at the lip of the cliff. There was a long drop
	down onto the islands of Pipe Land. He was lighter again.
	Dreadfully, he knew what that meant..</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Luddy,
	son of a biscuit! First you sleepwalk for like an hour, then
	whatever you call this?!? Put that down and look at me!!&rdquo;
	Lemmy rolled up to Ludwig and forcibly spun him his way, right after
	Ludwig bent to pick up the bell. Its glow abruptly died, like a
	busted light bulb. Was that the mythical object? </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So what?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
	peered closely at Ludwig&rsquo;s countenance for the first time
	since their voyage into town. Some lightning flashed and Lemmy
	gasped, rolling back. &ldquo;W-what&rsquo;s wrong with your eyes?&rdquo;
	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His
	pupils were blacker than the sky and irregularly shaped, starry. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	did an odd uncanny smile, like a non-humanoid entity attempting it
	for the first time. He then rang the bell in wild motions. Zoo was
	about to pick himself up, wring a koopaling neck and snatch it out
	of his paws when he froze at the taste of blood in his mouth,
	streaming from his nose. He didn't make it off the summit, his
	strength eroding in an instant. Using that bell for a rare neat
	effect always gave him a pang of weakness, but the way Ludwig abused
	it-</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy
	began to grimace, debilitated on his knees. The circus performer was
	beyond freaked out, because he never heard a proper ring under the
	thunder. Shortly the antique gave up the ghost and disintegrated in
	his brother's palms, some sort of particle or smoke releasing
	upwards into the air. Ludwig, his pupils blue once more,
	speechlessly staggered into Lemmy's arms, and they both collapsed
	into the high grass. The younger brother slid away from under him
	and craned his head upwards. The stormy clouds were shifting over to
	them. He could track it as the stars blanked out one by one and
	heavy gusty winds knocked him off his ball, and onto his knees,
	scabbing them up. The thunder seemed directly above them. He
	listened again. It was a voice all along!</font></p>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
	hurricane-like gale flicked the four bodies on the hill away like
	fleas. Those with spiked shells back into the woods, the one without
	the opposite direction. It was a very long drop down into the choppy
	seas of Pipe Land.</font></p>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The pink
	toad became exasperated by the looks received by his &lsquo;manager&rsquo;,
	watching him from the second-story balcony. Was attempting to
	garnish the lot, spending his dawn hours strenuously freeing the
	daisies from the choking snare of thorny weeds one by one, futile?
	He silently disagreed, slipping in longing over-the-shoulder glances
	as he drew away from the ten-by-ten planter in the middle of the
	concrete parking lot. Unlike most of his fellow displaced castle
	staff, he had had the equanimity to seek and latch on to and cherish
	any fragment of normality to be had. The gardener did not imagine
	there would be any other opportunities to do his job at the
	seven-story inn tucked in urban southwest Toad Town, known as Hotel
	Mario if the buzzing red neon lights were to be believed. Many
	didn&rsquo;t however!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
	persistent trio of chaperones, black spotted toads chatted behind
	the smudged glass entrance doors. The gardener passed them by
	uneventfully, needing service at the receptionist desk. He was so
	occupied he forgot to secure a room last night, a grave oversight
	when he was sweaty, caked with mud, and in dire need of a shower. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	bellhop goomba swiveled away from CRT tv with a loud screech,
	disinterest written all over him. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I take care of
	all you castle runts?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The toad
	signed &lsquo;Joseph&rsquo;. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What??
	Com'on, I&rsquo;m missing my strikers game and you expect me to sit
	here and read your mind? What do you want then??&rdquo; the goomba
	said belligerently, at least according to his lip movements.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Joe
	sighed, certain that at least translated. He pointed to the bold
	print placard &lsquo;CHECK IN HERE&rsquo; on the desk. Anything but
	to incur the same old platitudes he&rsquo;d heard his entire life
	when strangers sheepishly realized they were yelling at a deaf
	person. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	needs a lodge,&rdquo; someone with a northern tone spoke up,
	stepping over.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Shrinking
	somewhat, Joe looked up at the mushroom guard, a foot and a half
	taller and maybe one in a half times as wide. The guard&rsquo;s jaw
	jutted out a bit and he needed a haircut under his hat, but was
	decidedly handsome overall. His lanyard tag stated &lsquo;Benedict
	T., Poshley Royal Officer&rsquo;, and as hamstrung as he appeared,
	there was kindness evident in his dark brown eyes that tipped Joe
	that he meant well, even if he did not see what Ben just said.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The guard
	continued, &ldquo;I remember this one. He wasn&rsquo;t inside all
	night so there&rsquo;s no way he was given a key, eh.&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Begrudgingly
	the goomba shoved a room key under the plexiglass shield for Joe.
	The gardener signed &lsquo;thank you&rsquo; to the guard and went on
	his way deeper into the hotel.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-You
	sticking up for dummies?&rdquo; another guard ribbed Ben the moment
	he returned. He was the middle height of the three.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...Jon,
	I think he was disabled,&rdquo; Ben replied through his teeth. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh,
	sure. Much like-&rdquo; Jon nudged his elbow at the most stout guard
	whose back was turned as she watched a Jumpman themed gambling
	machine set to attract mode. He did not account for the fact that
	she saw that in the reflection.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	whipped around. &ldquo;You said you&rsquo;d locate that Mario guy by
	sunrise, haha. Who&rsquo;s stupid now?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Shut
	up Bridget! Nobody knows where that freak is!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Cause
	you&rsquo;re bossing us around instead of trying!&rdquo; Ben shouted
	back.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Is
	leaning from those thin balconies drilling in cameras not trying? Is
	wiring up surveillance by myself not trying?&rdquo; Jon slung open
	the door of the arcade room they&rsquo;d taken over as a base of
	sorts. &ldquo;You go in there and stare at the footage all day and
	then- Oh, sorry mate,&rdquo; he apologized when he almost slammed
	face first into someone leaving. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You&rsquo;re
	alright,&rdquo; the guest grunted. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The three
	guards straightened up their act in a flash, standing shoulder to
	shoulder, or approximately enough, as the portly middle aged fellow
	with a short recently grown beard, in a plain t-shirt and pants,
	strolled on by. To himself he smirked. That&rsquo;s really all it
	took to fool those amateurs, Mario thought!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	plumber rounded a corner, strategically avoided another, and
	proceeded down an adjacent path that he knew was unmonitored, based
	on what the guard&rsquo;s computers showed. That elation faded just
	as soon, for the truth was, he was losing the bigger battle at hand.
	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He&rsquo;d
	thrown in the towel just in time for Bowser to kidnap their beloved
	ruler in the most insultingly effortless way. Being bereaved in the
	middle of an epidemic lead to confusion, confusion to mourning, and
	mourning into resentment, all compounded by scandalous images
	circulating of Mario and Bowser &lsquo;frollicking&rsquo; around
	town yesterday. He&rsquo;d in fact had it thrown in his face a dozen
	times. With every viewing of that abhorrent image, Mario picked up
	an additional detail- the way his upper sleeve brushed up against
	the more sparsely layered scales of Bowser&rsquo;s, the way he
	minutely overtook the Koopa King on the sidewalk, as if he&rsquo;d
	be the one to shield him, how comfortable they seemed.. That last
	part made Mario&rsquo;s insides twirl and twist. No matter how
	propitiatory his explanations it was an anathema, punctuated by
	Bowser&rsquo;s treachery.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Consequently,
	the Mushroom King advanced beyond the mere invitation his daughter
	gave him before her kidnapping, and exerted himself into every
	aspect of Toad Town short of physical presence. Parakarry rushing to
	his front door at an unusual late hour with a declaration for his
	&lsquo;questioning&rsquo; plunged the most recognizable person in
	the kingdom into a near inescapable nightmare. Under the moonlight
	Mario packed and fled his house, altered his appearance, and took
	refuge in the most seedy area of town, intending to retrieve his
	brother the next morning and get out of dodge.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He&rsquo;d
	only forgotten in his haste that this was where Snifit Patrol
	dropped off Peach&rsquo;s toads!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After
	that mini heart attack, it was still salvageable- maybe. One of
	those castle toads was a true friend, with vital connections even.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">As well
	practiced, a prisoner bounced off his bed for the height he needed
	to cling to the iron bars high up. Light steadily rolled over the
	shanty roofs in the village. Some distance away, the more
	magnificent structures and spires of Poshley Heights were already
	soaking the sun.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Aye
	aye aye..&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The noki
	plopped back down on the bench and simmered, staring at the brick
	wall. Agent 0069&rsquo;s daring escape broke a rib, but he still
	hobbled back to base unidentified. Consequently, Andrew got to
	recover at the Toad Town Super Spy HQ and the noki in turn spent the
	night thousands of miles away in a high-security fortress.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A few
	more checks later and- there they were! A gentleman with a lady on
	his arm weaved around the stone garden leading to the jailhouse. The
	human male wore a tuxedo and his partner, a purple noki was adorned
	in a red ball gown. The only part of their spectacle the prisoner
	cared about however was the metal-covered platter in the madam's
	free hand, shining brightly. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Now he
	had something to smile about on the bench, kicking his legs that
	didn&rsquo;t quite reach the floor. Shortly, an officer was waddling
	down to his cell with the platter, uncovered to reveal a white cake
	with red and blue candies around the top. The ruse over, the couple
	that delivered it scurried away from the fortress while keeping a
	ten foot separation constantly, Agent W&rsquo;s arms crossed, Agent
	Maria pinching her nose in disgust..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	officer stuffed the cake carelessly into the one way reception cubby
	and ruined the succulent presentation. Agent 0064, known as
	Jelectro, eyed the strollin' stu indignantly yet Agent 0088,
	disguised as a Poshley Heights correctional officer, smirked in
	response. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Any
	news, mon ami?&rdquo; Jelectro whispered.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
	want the red plumber in here.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">In a rare
	moment Jelectro was dumbstruck. Eventually he placed the messy
	delicacy on his bench, a couple&rsquo;s cake, of vital importance
	for his escape. There was one issue. How the mechanic worked he did
	not understand, but they were impossible to eat alone.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	economy lounge, the more drab and smaller of the two in Hotel Mario:
	A ninji porter who thought he was some sort of performer, sat on the
	counter of the closed bar, reading off numbers for the after
	breakfast bingo games. Zeror and Chef Tim played along, if
	ironically, for the paltry prizes, aware that they&rsquo;d salvaged
	more than enough from the castle and had it secured upstairs. Ajar
	shutter doors lead to the pool deck where a purple toad, Les huddled
	up under the patio in a foreignly antisocial manner. Additional
	d&eacute;cor included couches, low tables, and potted plastic trees,
	that last of which became Mario&rsquo;s cover and he tiptoed through
	the lounge and into the darkened bar. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Careful
	to not tip glasses, he stooped lower than the counter and slipped
	into a back room with boxed ingredients and a broken ice machine
	hooked to the wall. Bucken-Berry had pried out the water line with
	his bare hands a while ago, creating an opening through the cheap
	sheetrock. He had to crawl to see out of it, but encouragingly dew
	coated grass and the hotel's rusty dumpsters were plain view.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	eagerly awaited his second ally, purportedly acquiring some
	inconspicuous transport out. Too paranoid to wander off, his knees
	became numb without the padding of his signature overalls&hellip;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Little
	feet dropped down inches from his nose.. &quot;Greetings sir!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	jolted, kicking over an empty beer can with a clang.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The red
	spotted toad bent to level and flashed him a picture perfect smile.
	&quot;Sorry, sir. Ready for adventure?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No.
	I'm not..&quot; Mario pant, fuming. &quot;I can hide for another
	hour I think maximum. Can you check on Luigi at the Toadley Clinic
	and come straight back? Here's his phone I've been holding, and
	this. It's his favorite in the morning, the only fresh fruit in this
	place funny enough.&quot; He handed off a ripe banana and Luigi's
	YoshiMobile.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">While his
	buddy took the items, he lingered. &quot;Mr. Lionel Kinopio is
	blogging about this entire matter from his limited perspective at MK
	East. What a travesty.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;..Seriously,
	Stan??.. Look, get my brother and then me. We'll talk.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Of
	course. Adieu,&quot; his helper replied, gently patting Mario's
	gloveless hand.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	rolled to his left, expecting to reach over and touch the console
	between his bed and Mario&rsquo;s. His arm instead thrust around
	into empty space, save for a metal pole that jangled. He slowly
	leaned up. Pulling back the partition curtain revealed Dr. Toadley&rsquo;s
	lab, devoid of patients and ransacked. Sheets from cots were piled
	in the corners. Hay, dirt, and hoof prints also marred the floors,
	the intern sweeping and cleaning around to the best of her ability
	in some unexpectedly casual wear, like slippers and a night bonnet.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With a
	burst of energy, he leaped off his cot and dashed out of the lab,
	not making it farther than the lobby when he collapsed, just
	catching a chair before he smacked the floor. Heart thumping in his
	ears, the first thing he made out was the character analog clock
	above the intern desk, a cartoony representation of his brother. He
	wasn&rsquo;t sure what time it was when he encountered Zoo in the
	park, but it appeared to be a </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Friday</font></em>
	<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">evening now.
	Maybe that clock was a little slow, or he was lightning quick in
	defeating the bad guy. Now where was Mario and the gang? </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	regathered his strength and rolled over as Dr. Toadley waltzed into
	the lobby, barefoot and wearing a purple sleeping robe, gasping upon
	the sight of the green plumber. He rushed over. &ldquo;Has my
	Miracle Toadley Cure worked? Yes it has!&rdquo; he exclaimed, poking
	and prodding intrusively. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	gently pried his hands off. &ldquo;Thank you?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	doctor flushed, retrieving a memo pad and jotting a few things from
	right to left, Luigi found strange. &ldquo;All medical
	establishments rejected my special Miracle Toadley Cure. Did I think
	I would ever have an opportunity to revitalize someone with it? No I
	did not. If I may?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That&rsquo;s
	definitely unfair-&rdquo; Luigi had a thermometer shoved into his
	mouth. Where did it just come from?.. Anyway, he began to perceive a
	surge of energy from within, as if he guzzled too much coffee. His
	digits quaked. Was it that or something more? He often had extra
	senses for a variety of things. Sometimes it was skittishness for
	nothing, other times </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">something</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">..
	&ldquo;If I was split in half and this fixed me, what&rsquo;s the
	problem?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The toad
	doctor lifted from his notes, wariness sweeping across his features.
	&ldquo;Is Mirror Mode a temporary side effect? Yes, it is.&rdquo; He
	raised a hand. &ldquo;Right or left?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Right?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...Secondary
	test. What time is it?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Four

	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Eight-fifty.
	On an atypical Saturday morning!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Where&rsquo;s
	Mario?&rdquo; he begged.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	Mushroom King believes the red plumber had a ploy to get the
	princess kidnapped by King Bowser!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	spat out the thermometer. He shuddered from the sudden warmth on his
	shoulder from the toad doctor's palm. He rose to meet Dr. Toadley&rsquo;s
	gaze, his bare face, deceivingly more youthful than he sounded and
	behaved, painted with deep sympathy.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Am
	I still on your brother's side? Yes, I assure you. Our local
	hospital was taken over by the King as so I had some cowboys- long
	story, evacuate my patients before they were snatched away.&quot;
	Someone outside the clinic tapped on the glass front. Dr. Toadley
	chose to ignore it as his intern left the lab to deal with it. He
	continued, &quot;Is Southern Mushroom Kingdom a location where the
	King's laws do not hold precedent? Yes. My MKDCU affiliate Parabilly
	resides there.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi's
	eyes watered from the headache, endeavoring to think logically. It
	was the only way to help Mario. Bowser betrayed them. He might have
	been innocent at some point, but it didn't matter now. Why would the
	King, knowing his word was the law in the absence of their princess,
	adopt the drastic line of thinking that his brother planned this?
	Why did Peach even call on him yesterday when she never mentioned
	her father ever? So many pieces were missing from the puzzle.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Let
	me make a call.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A toad
	that the intern had just let in handed Luigi his YoshiMobile on cue.
	Astonished, the green plumber rose to his wobbly feet. He couldn't
	believe who he was seeing, at least without the brigade he was
	typically glued to.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	have a hunch your first call will be to your brother. Do not bother.
	Mr. Mario destroyed his phone to prevent tracking and he wants me to
	take you back to him before he expediently vacates.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
	wouldn&rsquo;t bother to do that hacking stuff to mine?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thanks,
	Captain Toad.&rdquo; Luigi set himself up for that, but it was kinda
	funny, enough to make him light headed as he laughed and laughed,
	continuing until he found himself on the hard tiled floor again,
	gasping for air next to their feet.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr.
	Toadley slapped his forehead. &ldquo;Was there an additional side
	effect of my Miracle Toadley Cure? Yes there was!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	shivered from a blast of cold. Half awake, he buttoned up a leather
	jacket that smelt pungent and manish, yet also faintly like his
	brother for some reason. He opened his eyes. He rode in the
	passenger spot of a wide bodied kart with three rows of seats. He
	could tell by the hood it was finished pale beige. Older modeled by
	the tarnished silver instruments on the dash, the plush burst orange
	interior package, and the wood grain panels. Remaining lazily
	reclined, he observed the city scrolling by. Toad Town seemed busy
	as normal, yet it became a spot the difference puzzle. Some block
	corners featured an armored Dry Bomber kart, repurposed for Mushroom
	forces. A gaggle of black spotted toads patrolled the sidewalks
	among the Mushroomite pedestrians, covered in body armor and
	carrying various spears and firearms. Yoshis using morph bubbles to
	transform into helicopters swooped around in aerial reconnaissance
	patterns. Promotionals tacked to some storefronts featured Mario,
	now defaced in various ways.. He was roused most by a large sign
	that passed by as they pulled onto a road with a steep incline.</font></p>

	ecaR layoR&rsquo;</font></em> 
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Eyebrows
	furrowing, the plumber respelled that out in his mind. &quot;Mario
	is here?&quot; he asked raspily. He tilted to the driver, who was
	biting his lip, visibly jumbled by the simple question. He knew he'd
	have this problem with Stan. He uncannily resembled Toad in skin
	only. &quot;Captain!!! Where are we going??&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	Captain began to exude a different energy. &quot;Not much farther,
	Mr. Luigi. Have you seen Kinopio's recent ramblings?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No
	and I don't care. He was brought on for the pact. Seems reasonable,
	but Peach looked at follower numbers and went with that. Never mind
	he's the only toad to conspicuously dodge Mario and I. No, we didn't
	get a chance to sniff him out, so nothing is conclusive. We just
	know he's from Japan, Water Land.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
	have a problem with the Japanese?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;That's
	not what I!... Good to know his injuries weren't that bad if he's
	feeling up to his blogging ways.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;His
	legs are broken and there's a crack in his spine. He might have
	partial paralysis from now on,&quot; The Captain volunteered matter
	of factly, swinging their kart left and right to avoid the
	increasing amount of debris in the road as they entered official
	Castle Grounds.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The green
	plumber dropped that topic, horrified at the sight just across the
	glassy lake.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The first
	level of Peach Castle was totally disintegrated so that the
	crumbling brick on ground level currently, intruding on the basement
	and being flooded by the moat water was her second floor. The roof's
	pink tiles were spread more on the ground than attached to the
	building, and all the grass and vegetation was dead, the earthy
	surroundings a sea of murky dark brown. The land in general sloped
	upwards despite Star Hill being located a mile away.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;It's
	different,&quot; The Captain remarked in a lower, more real tone.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Huh?&quot;
	Luigi snapped back to the driver. Captain Toad's knuckles were
	revealingly white around the steering wheel.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Nothing!...&quot;
	They cruised down the sandy driveway that used to curve to the
	bridge. That only revealed more distressing sights.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Citizens,
	toads, some koopas, bob-omb buddies, etc spotted the property,
	mourning in sizable groups, often cuddling with a companion. For
	what had stood sacredly as the capitol building for hundreds of
	years, that was its unceremonious end. Bowser was not the blame for
	once. Some literal no-body, some 'Zoo' guy with a bell did it. It
	didn't seem right. Splitting him in half was one thing, King Boo for
	instance could mutilate a single target if he pleased, but warping
	the environment?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Captain,
	just turn around already! We gotta report this.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	Captain slammed on the brakes, making the right side of Luigi's face
	smack against the dashboard. The kart screeched and kicked up sand.
	A few around spared a glance before ignoring them again.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Ouch!
	What was that?!&quot; Luigi demanded as they reversed the way they'd
	come, driving backwards.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	complied! My goodness! Hahaha..&quot; The Captain honked as a few
	mushroomites dove out of the way. The kart careened down hill and
	the driver appeared to rely solely on the jiggling cracked in the
	center rear view mirror.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	revolved in his seat, shrieking at the innumerable near misses.
	Everything rattled and squeaked like they would break up. &quot;Captain!
	Watch out for that pianta to the right! I mean left! I mean- Why?!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	Captain's beady eyes glimmered. &quot;I know of the forces at play..
	Golly, in fact I've been the curator of such.&quot;<br/>
&quot;You've
	what?! Forget it. Move!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A young
	toad was trying to flag them down by standing directly in their path
	and flailing his arms. Luigi tugged the steering wheel, avoiding the
	dude by a hair. An ejected marble column from the castle launched
	the kart ten feet into the sky. The landing shook them like an
	earthquake, interior panels popping off, the sun shields flopping
	down, the radio sliding out, the rear view mirror detaching, and the
	glove compartment spilling its contents, mockingly of medical
	supplies into Luigi's lap.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
	slowly faced each other.. Before one could wring the neck of the
	other- guess which was which, a liquid sploshing noise alerted them
	from under the car. Whatever was running from their kart, the slimy
	dark stuff proceeded to roll into the nearby lake and pollute the
	environment. They got out and dropped belly first into the grit of
	the shore, groping around the many parts and pipes shaken loose in
	vain for the source of the growing leak. They stood again
	eventually.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;This
	is a rental. Let me study the manual.&quot; The Captain pulled out a
	magnifying glass.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	tapped his foot, wishing he was his more mechanically inclined
	brother. &hellip;Or not. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take forever. We need to
	tell Mario we can regroup safely down south.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ah,
	a treasure hotspot.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Focus
	on that book!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">This
	will ease you.&rdquo; He tossed him a banana.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	munched on it angrily- at first. &ldquo;...Oh hey, you&rsquo;re
	right.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Just out
	of their view, the teenager that was almost tenderized kept inching
	closer. If he wasn't Darklandian, he'd be sure the stars were
	smiting him. No matter what he did since hopping on that baddie
	shipping truck into town, it spiraled into something horrific. This
	was it, he thought stoically. He&rsquo;d fess up.</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;M
	SORRY!!!&rdquo; he cried hysterically, barging into Luigi and
	Captain Toad. The haggard teen threw himself down before their
	boots. &ldquo;It was all me. Oh my God, I&rsquo;m sorry again! I was
	new here, yesterday, and then- the castle- went- it- did a thing
	and- the sky and-!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	turned to the Captain. &quot;He's lost it, and we can't even drive
	him to get some help!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thomas
	perked up. &ldquo;Just patch the synthol tank. The rock pierced it.
	Here. Use something like this,&rdquo; he reached for some of the
	first aid patches and spray adhesive that had tumbled out the car.
	He crawled under the vehicle for only a few seconds and returned to
	the plumber&rsquo;s side. The oil or gas or whatever it was dried up
	in seconds. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi pat
	him on the back appreciatively, hiding how unsettled he was when the
	teen felt so scrawny. &quot;You're pretty good-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Thomas.&quot;
	To his dismay, the teen welled up. &quot;Mr. Zoo was looking for me
	and so&hellip;I-I caused this!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
	didn't,&quot; The Captain spoke up first, surprising Luigi. &quot;I
	am sure you contributed however..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Nevermind.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Babe
	don't! See? It's nothing. Okay? Just go back to our room.&quot;</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Why
	you gotta do this? Stop scrambling around looking for..&quot;</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
	listening to me??&quot;</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;WAIT!
	It's closed sweetheart, what do you want in there?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Behind
	the lounge's bar, Bucken-Berry pressed his hand over her's once she
	placed it on the storage room handle.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
	furiously spun into him. &quot;Back off Blue.&quot; She ducked under
	his arm and slipped into the totally icky and musty dark room, rife
	with a stale beer smell, and cheaply stored food, with an unsightly
	hole in the wall. The crumbly plaster matched the stuff her
	boyfriend struggled to brush off his clothes and shower from his
	skin.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Why
	are you destroying the property? It doesn't need you to do that,&quot;
	she teased at first. In the corner of her eye however, behind
	Bucken-Berry's sneakers as he shuffled in was a red duffle bag
	hidden behind kegs.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Is
	that Mario's?&quot; She blushed. &quot;Oh my gosh, he's been here
	and you knew it?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The blue
	toad kept his head down. &quot;Is this situation fair to him?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Of
	course not! But we have an allegiance to all Toadstools and.. I'm
	sure they'll handle... So you've met with him?&quot; Her accusatory
	glare impaled him.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Toadette,
	it ain't a fanboy thing. It's screwed up.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;The
	decree-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-You

	following's why we're stuck in this hotel!! Where I can't even visit
	Ala-Gold during his last hours on Earth!!!&quot;<br/>
Her scowl
	faded away. &quot;I understand..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;And
	now you're about to backpedal..&quot; he growled. &quot;It's how
	these conversations always go. Toadette, you're supposed to be
	smart. We're listening to Peach's dad who sent his agents on us
	instead of getting his daughter back. What, if you capitulate- I
	used it right this time- enough it'll work out?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Blue,
	oh my gosh,&quot; she exclaimed, sitting stuffily on a supply box.
	&quot;All of this is unideal to me too. Why are you so pissed at
	me?!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Why
	are you stringing me along?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	stared incredulously, flushing. &quot;I'm not!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	thawed, facing away. &quot;Princess school. Ring a bell? Thought so.
	Parakarry must have had a late night out. He knocked on my window
	with the invite. It was me that dropped it on your night stand, not
	Toadsworth.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette

	monty-mole porter crossed by, munching on a Muku cookie while
	pushing that cleaning cart. Ben's stomach rumbled, and like a cheep

	not picky. Let's go,&quot; he replied brusquely.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">This
	seemed to work and they rose together to the elevator, crossing the
	bar counter and the slightly ajar back room door.. He selected floor
	four and waited alongside the sentry while some old school elevator
	music buzzed from a dusty speaker. He wasn't sure if he should slump
	or stand more erect to obfuscate his identity better. Benedict was
	no half-pint, and then there was the matter of that lethal super
	scope he carried&hellip;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Back in
	the lounge the blue and pink toad were on their feet. &quot;Crud!&quot;
	Bucken-Berry broke into a sprint with Toadette on his heels. They
	retreated to their sorta junky and messy suite and jumped on the
	most clear of the twin beds. &quot;That won't hold up.&quot; He
	called someone.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Not
	even with the power of his beard?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He faced
	her, phone pressed to his ear. &quot;No. Not even that.&quot; He
	groaned, not getting anyone. He tapped an extremely inflammatory
	message to The Captain then.<br/>
She peeked over his phone,
	blushing. &quot;You'd do WHAT to him in a fight??&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	smirked. &quot;You know it, babe.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Good.
	He chose treasure over me multiple times on an adventure once. I
	have never liked him since.&quot; She pressed her lips into his,
	making them fall back.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Curtis
	led the guard as nonchalantly as he could toward room 404. Zeror,
	Peach's worldly banker and treasure curator, wasn't superstitious of
	the number four and in fact relished being roomed away from the
	rest. Diabetic, he would have to be downstairs somewhere for lunch.
	All the human had to do was pretend this was his suit and-</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Here,
	sir?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yes.
	-Wait don't!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The guard
	kicked the door in with a thunderously loud bang. Curtis winched as
	Ben erratically swept around the twin bedroom with his super scope
	drawn. Salvaged items of Peach Castle stacked along all four walls
	in crates and boxes.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ben
	lowered the gun, unenthused. &quot;Quite a haystack to find a little
	mouser, eh?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
	have to start somewhere.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ben froze
	before one particular stack of goods. &quot;Yeah, like this one. Why
	does this say 'Property of Peach Castle'?&quot; he asked with
	suspicion.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Beads of
	sweat formed on Curtis' hatless head. &quot;From a private auction
	I'm sure,&quot; he guessed, unable to see what Ben was staring at a
	foot or so above his eye level.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;The
	princess would vend those precious jewels? I am not stupid, sir. She
	is not strapped for cash!&quot; Ben abruptly pushed Curtis into the
	crate stack, pinning him tightly in place with his forearm. Some
	crates toppled to the floor, hoards of beautiful gems and old bronze
	artifacts spilling out. &quot;Everyone in the eight continental
	kingdoms knows your name and to think, you've hurt our princess so
	wantonly! You're the wanted thief...&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Fine,
	I'm Mario.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Waluigi!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;...What?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Then the
	radio strapped to the guard's hip beeped and went off.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Would
	you believe people down here don't know how to park?&quot; That
	lioness with them cackled. &quot;When they pulled up near the back
	dumpster, I made them use the parking lot like civilized people.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ben
	scrambled to click the call button, having to find it under his
	shirt. Before he could reply the other guard responded.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Why
	is this news, mate?&quot; Jon replied vexingly.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Well,
	you'd think Luigi would know better than that!&quot; Bridget said.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Would
	he?&quot; Ben asked Mario.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Maybe.
	Would you know better than to take your eyes and hands off the
	perpetrator?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	socked him in the jaw, stunning the toad. He grabbed Ben by the
	lanyard and slung him backwards into the crate stack collapsing the
	rest of the hoard. With the exit barricaded, Mario pressed against
	the sealed window. Beyond the balcony he spotted The Captain's kart,
	one of several run down ones parked in the front of Hotel Mario.
	What were they doing? They were identified! Mario felt around antsy
	for a latch, stuck from old paint layered on. He needed a blunt
	object. As Ben was stirring under the pile of antiques, Mario hauled
	some giant paper wrapped picture frames over his head, trapping him.
	He picked up Ben's discarded super scope and rammed the stock of it
	against the glass. With mounting frustration his fingers pressed
	something they shouldn't have and he accidentally shot a yellow
	energy beam behind him at the heavy down bed comforter. Smoke
	billowed as alarms blared, both obscuring the sound and vision of
	the one charging at him.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wham!
	They burst through the window, sliding on the balcony outside. Mario
	squeezed his eyes shut as he was pummeled by the once docile giant,
	and inch from the edge. The second Ben's energy was expelled, Mario
	used that opportunity to whip him with the barrel of the super
	scope. Ben flew backwards with a groan. Bruised and bloodied, Mario
	staggered to his feet, aiming the weapon in between the toad's brown
	eyes. Ben jut his hands into the air, speechless.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	wouldn't blast his head off, but the guard didn't believe that. What
	lies had the King spread? It made him appalled he'd made the
	threatening display, chucking the super scope away to leap off the
	balcony and onto a camera drilled into some gutter drain pipes.
	Below Hotel Mario had more guests than imagined evacuating.
	Steadily, the pipe began to flex under the plumber's weight. The
	drop was just higher than he knew he could take without injury. Then
	out of the sea of folks, his angel was revealed. He dropped four
	stories down into the arms of Bucken-Berry, bridal style.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Thanks
	buddy.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Heh.
	Whatever.&quot; The toad carried him a semi brisk pace.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
	can put me down.&quot; Mario went, wryly. &quot;Might be quicker.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">One
	scattered in the lot never smelt smoke or saw any flames. Jon
	twisted in time to see a human and toad heading for a Kart parked in
	the rear of the lot. Something seemed odd about it, the way they
	were making a mad dash when others impatiently waited for the fire
	department to show and allow them in. Then some prankster toad girl
	with pigtails pulled a pillowcase over him, making him trip over a
	parking block and curse.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">By then
	Mario and Bucken-Berry reached the kart, swinging in. &quot;Go!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
	wish is my command.&quot; The Captain turned the key a couple of
	times. &quot;Or a suggestion rather.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">As
	sitting ducks, here came the 'zapper' as Bridget popped up in the
	passenger window, ice cream cone in hand.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She was a
	cute little thing if ruddy, sandy hair hanging limp under the black
	spotted toad cap, smiling and displaying a childish tooth gap. &quot;Oh
	wow, ha ha, I did something right! I found Luigi AND Mario, hahaha.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	compulsively laughed with her, more and more, his seat giving way
	and kicking back. She froze, confused but flattered as he cracked
	apart.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Alright,
	I was gonna send a bunch of copters over to vaporize you, but I'll
	give you a five second head start. Okay go.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;How
	about a five second push? With me?&quot; So authoritatively Mario
	spoke then, the guard lady obeyed. They rolled the kart backwards,
	giving it a push start. &quot;Thanks.&quot; Mario winked and hopped
	on the hood, leaving her and Hotel Mario behind as they rolled onto
	Starman Lane in reverse. Mario dropped back in from the sun roof.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
	can turn around in that open driveway other there-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No
	need.&quot; Captain Toad mashed the gas, catapulting them down the
	street and through many red lights. Cars honking was a wall of noise
	from every direction. Some mushroom tanks spotted and chased them
	preparing to fire. Chill as a freezie, The Captain made a sharp turn
	onto an exit away from the city. The ramp dumped them over bumpier
	paths with barbed wire fencing lining the street banks.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	know that Mario Kart race was two days ago, but anyone held on to an
	item?&quot; Mario asked.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The fifth
	passenger, tucked away in the third row the entire time, hurled
	Luigi's garbage banana peel out from the sunroof, forcing the tanks
	to veer off road and plow over cacti.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Who
	did that?&quot; Bucken-Berry's blood ran cold finding Thomas, the
	new guy in the thrid row.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">As for
	the rest of the occupants, including Luigi deliriously recovering
	from the laughing fit, they wondered why the hunt was abruptly cut
	off, the tanks shrinking with distance.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A quarter
	mile back, some guards scrambled out their armored vehicles and beat
	their fists into the red soil. Mt. Rugged and mesas, light and hazy
	were in the background, a hint of the inhospitable territory beyond,
	yet the barrier keeping them at bay was a single painted white line
	in the road, the Toad Town to Southern Mushroom Kingdom border.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	felt his soul drift about in the aether, awaiting it&rsquo;s final
	destination. His outer layers shed piece by piece, the side of him
	that desired more badges than a trophy case could hold, the part
	that held his own musical pieces in the same regard as Kchaikovsky,
	the part that cackled like a maniac during lab experiments- until he
	was lucent, uncolored, down to the scrupulous bits. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He used
	to worry about his future, what might be left of his role as his
	siblings, one in particular grew older. If he could really make a
	difference for his koopa brethren in that short span. An army could
	pillage a kingdom in days, yet its progress may be undone just as
	quickly by toads and their worker bee ways. His purpose therefore
	was not destruction for destruction&rsquo;s sake, chaotic sadistic
	endeavors, though that may have been the rite of his ancestors, but
	rather to dismantle their institutions and free its members from an
	enslavement they may not be cognizant of. Like a beautiful
	orchestra, only then would all the diverse &lsquo;sections&rsquo;
	blend with true harmony.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Too bad
	he never had a chance! This was the woeful &lsquo;him&rsquo;
	ultimately presented for judgment, approaching the gate that
	enclosed a suspended sapphire colored perfectly square platform in
	space. There were white fields, sparkling rivers, and of course a
	stupendous golden castle towering high above.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	Koopaling&rsquo;s eyes, or whatever physical embodiment was left of
	them narrowed, focusing on a holographic scroll posted to the gate
	with a crooked nail.</font></p>
	<p><em>&lsquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Attention,

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The beige
	paint on the hood of the car bubbled. The wood paneling delaminated
	and flaked off. The exposed metal parts developed a glow like a
	stove top. That was after a mere fifteen minutes driving on the
	fringe of Dry Dry Desert. A tweester shorty after bombarded them and
	plopped the kart smack in the middle of the parched land. That was
	when trepidation crept into the caravan. A sandstorm forced the
	windows up in the kart, making temperatures rise astronomically. The
	three toads present, all hardy in their own way, were able to
	tolerate it, but for the humans it all went white.<br/>
&hellip;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario and
	Luigi glanced at each other periodically in the tided up den,
	containing only what it was supposed to, the large screen
	entertainment system, a portrait or two on the walls, and comfy
	recliner chairs stationed side by side. There was no conflict, aside
	from over the remote. The television was fixed to Luigi's favored
	Bob-omb Ross program. The afroed artist delicately crafted a scene
	of a tropical paradise, fitting as it was a perfect day in the
	roofless cutout of their living room floating in the foggy
	dreamscape.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Consequently,
	it was with guilt that discontentment swept across the younger
	brother's features. &quot;I can't sit here and pretend anymore. Why
	can't I get Yoshi? This isn't like him.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;It's
	still better he's removed from this situation.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	understand why you say that, but..&quot; He stared downwards at the
	starman pattern blanket laying across his lap, considering jabbing
	the off button on the remote. &quot;Know what? I'll trust you
	again.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His
	brother's fingers curled on the armrest. On tv, the tranquil
	masterpiece took a swerve. On the edges of the canvas darker skies
	encroached. &quot;Good. -I mean, good I can still invoke that-
	'trust me' reverence,&quot; he said pithily.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	straightened his posture, kicking the leg rest down. &quot;...So is
	this a bad time to mention that Kinopio-Kun is blogging against you?
	That you're a wanted suspect? That all but five Mushroom Flu
	patients are still at MK East? That-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	squeezed his hand lightly. &quot;I knew already.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;..Good!
	Or.. Sorry bro. What good is this fantasy? I'm supposed to be alert,
	aloof-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;This
	is your first day in my shoes alright-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	slapped him with his 'L' emblem pillow. &quot;Not overly so. Besides
	I think I know work and life balance more than you.. Tell me
	something you wouldn't in the real world then.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;When
	I had to use Cappy on Bowser, there wasn't anything I learned that
	he hadn't told me at some point. With Peach, she's always holding
	back.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Well,
	you two were never 'official'.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;That's
	the key? No. One didn't want to be caged by the past and another
	isn't willing to leave that cage yet. Simple.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	retrieved a thick dusty book wedged in the magazine rack, why he
	didn't know when it was some V8 engine manual. That might had been
	true, but unlike Mario content to note the quirks of the alien
	environment, he liked to properly document it, research, journal,
	sometimes even write a story out of it.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Alright,
	so he was susceptible to some fantasy. Now he was imagining some
	music for instance, and neither of their preferred genres.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The banjo
	and 'geetar' dueled with an intricate folksy melody. High powered
	pedal steel amplifiers with fifteen inch speakers broadcast from the
	wooden covered porch of the Southern Mushroom Kingdom Hospital.
	There were no cell phones, radios, or cars speeding in the shanty
	town, just a distant rumble from the tweesters of the desert fenced
	off 'round back. Ranchers and herders, most of the koopa or shy guy
	variety, crossed by, their work boots and the prancing feet of
	ostros marking fresh tracks as they did business.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After a
	slew of off-tuned counter-melodies from the country guitar, the tune
	came to a close with a pop.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Dang
	it, Junior. Whole thang ruined!&quot; The straw hat wearing ptooie
	plant smacked the koopa in the rocking chair beside him.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jr.
	Troopa readjusted his black ten gallon hat. &quot;Thought I nailed
	that verse, pard!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Prot&eacute;g&eacute;
	of the reclusive CEO 'Mr. X' as of a few months ago, Troopa remained
	unconvinced if antics like this were some kind of hillbilly hazing
	or simply how things worked down in this backwards offshoot of the
	Mushroom Kingdom. Tomorrow it could be moo moo wrangling, or
	harvesting wiggler silk, or being the target for cork gun
	quickdraws. -None of which had to do with his actual occupation as a
	triage nurse. Then again, dysfunction was exciting compared to the
	lonely Toad Town apartment the twenty year old had to look forward
	to every night at twelve..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Troopa
	placed the acoustic guitar into his hard case and stood, stretching
	his legs. &quot;Head'n to the can, partner.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Again?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Umm.
	Yep!&quot; Jr. Troopa scoot away, aware Victor P. had some venus
	fire trap genes.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	koopa's awkward wings that never quite developed fully carried him
	pitifully low over unpaved streets, aiming for his office down the
	block. If there was one thing he enjoyed it was how he could wear a
	hat all the time and hide his untamable messy brown hair. If there
	was a thing he hated, it was how messages were sent. Here came one
	now, dirt flying high in their wake.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Sir,
	hold a sec!&quot; A nurse, a normal one not a countrified version,
	skidded his ostro a stop at Troopa's side, sending the second
	occupant on the back, a red toad in a white doctor's coat sliding
	off the leather saddle and face first into the dirt.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Troopa
	automatically pulled him up. They locked eye to eye in an intensity
	Laki the nurse picked up on. He nodded and left the scene quickly.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Doc?
	You're back?&quot; Troopa spoke at last, dropping the cowpoke act.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
	brushed the dirt off his jacket, all dignified like. &quot;Dr.
	Toadley's formal inquiry found its way into my shredder, but I got
	word of your Mushroom Flu predicament regardless,&quot; he
	explained. &quot;I had no plans, but you know how I am flexible,
	don't you?-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Mhm.&quot;
	Troopa flushed harder. Meddlesome as usual, still lanky, pompous..
	Also just as tall and successful as ever, with blonde hair longer
	than last time he'd seen him, tucked under the red cap. By the way
	he couldn't stand him...</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-A
	crew will be joining me later. Now, will you explain why your
	associate spotted me, swung me on that animal, and gushed about your
	tremendously good rapport during the entire trip?&quot; Dr. Toad
	folded his arms, smirking. &quot;You are the secretary of this
	facility, I've already been told. Wonderful to see my ex-partner
	level up. Finally.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jr.
	Troopa seized the toad by his upper shoulder. &quot;In there. Now!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	dragged him into the closest building out of the rays of the sun and
	prying passerby, the empty saloon. A ruff puff waitress noticed them
	and shuffled away to grab an apron. They slid into the bench close
	to the western swing door. Why'd it have to be Ruff Parlor, one of
	the few eateries around they'd been to before together? Dr. Toad was
	a food scientist starting out, so there was some educational
	motivation besides the two of them hanging out, soon to realize it
	wasn't 'bout to work.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	don't care if you're helping us out with the five we got.&quot;
	Troopa crossed his arms. &quot;Just don't be funny about it!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
	drummed his skinny fingers against the table, simultaneously viewing
	chart or pdf on his phone. &quot;All I need is two two-acre sized
	area for parking and your vacant office space.&quot;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">My</font></em>
	<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">office
	space?!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Correct.
	Yours,&rdquo; Dr. Toad emphasized, some modulation- was that
	playfulness- sneaking into his low dryish voice. &ldquo;That is your
	fait accompli, Jackson.&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jackson&rsquo;
	Troopa Jr. narrowed his eyes. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the real reason
	you&rsquo;re here, Drew?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Because
	the only other Mushroom Flu patents are in Toad Town, which is too
	outdated for my advanced procedures and remedies. That was why I had
	to move out.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	waitress sat a mug of creme soda down. Troopa Jr. took a long overly
	loud sip, wiping away the fizz mustache after. &ldquo;Sure that was
	the only reason??&rdquo; he snapped. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Obliviously,
	Dr. &lsquo;Drew&rsquo; Toad lifted one eyebrow.. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hon,
	your radio with cha?&rdquo; asked the waitress lingering with the
	two men. &ldquo;Vick&rsquo;s blowing the staff up!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Troopa
	shot her a look. &ldquo;What miss, for an encore?!?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Naw,
	spotters saw this smoked-out kart roll&rsquo;n along. Mr. Mario, Mr.
	Luigi, and three cute lil toads are in it!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So
	yeah you can uh, leave your name and number and I&rsquo;ll, uh, call
	back when I can! Seeya!&rsquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo&rsquo;s
	empty stomach rumbled as the only number they had saved on their
	phone, aside from their mother, routed to voicemail repeatedly.
	Another worrisome thing to top the pile of this strange day so far.
	They&rsquo;d woken up super late with a migraine and no recollection
	of what occurred since stumbling into that Club Gamecube place they
	shouldn't have yesterday. Their compulsive habit of browsing the
	Toad Town message boards was a bust as well, making them reflect on
	&lsquo;back in the day&rsquo;- actually just a year ago or so when
	all they had courage to do was passively watch and swoon at Mario
	and company, particularly the younger Mario brother, during games
	and public events and romps with Bowser. They couldn&rsquo;t go back
	to that!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo
	scraped up some courage and ventured out into Toad Town. They made
	it as far as Tayce T.&rsquo;s shop on the East side where local kids
	from the Dojo were waiting at the corner&rsquo;s bus stop. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
	gonna be picked!&rsquo; And another would go, &lsquo;No me! I&rsquo;m
	third-degree level!&rsquo; and the third, &lsquo;Actually both of
	you have low probability. *snorts* They prefer toads. Said so in the
	fine print of the-&rsquo;. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Some
	shadows crept over Boo from behind. They spun around, face to face
	with a group of rugged, scary, heavily armed.. toads? Boo shot back
	home, beginning to understand just how much of the confidence on
	display yesterday, or what they remembered of it, was a contact
	high- Boo stopped there, too square for such a simile. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Excuse
	me buddy!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	parakoopa brushed beyond Boo and sprint hopped up the cabin steps of
	the neighbor, slipping a one page news bulletin partially into the
	door and scuttling off before Boo could correct them. Boo was a
	diddly. The pink boo in that conspicuous picture-estique oak wood
	cabin was a &lsquo;boo buddy&rsquo; however, or at least a rejected
	one according to the tale he told Boo once, recounted in his bouncy
	cadence and punctuated by a creepy giggle. Those hibbie-jibbies sped
	Boo along subconsciously because they were already back in town,
	just in time to catch Parakarry crossing the bridge and delivering
	mail to an office building on the street. Modern, it was not of
	Mushroomy architecture but sleeker, more boxy and efficient with a
	single cubby on the ground floor, tucked away in a recess to keep it
	out of the sun.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo
	approached as Parakarry steadily filled it up with pink flyers. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mail
	call!&rdquo; he sang, handing Boo a thin advert bundle. &ldquo;No
	long face. Junk mail means they know you&rsquo;re still alive, so
	somebody's always thinking about cha, if you want to see it like
	that.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">..Right.
	I think. Why&rsquo;d you skip my house the first time?&rdquo; Boo
	thought to ask.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	paratroopa&rsquo;s smile stretched, hovering his key outside the
	cubby lock. &ldquo;Hm?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	thought I saw you drop something off for Trevor Buddy?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Parakarry
	secured the box with a metallic clang. &ldquo;Nope nope nope.. Now
	I&rsquo;m a little busy, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Something
	overtook Boo. They reached for the parakoopa as he shimmied by,
	pressing him shell first against the metal box. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">DID
	YOU JUST LIE TO MY FACE?!? I saw you with my own freaking eyes!!&rdquo;
	Booigi the Second growled. Their pressure against his scale plates
	chilled him to the touch. &ldquo;I. Saw. You. WHAT WERE YOU
	DOING?!?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">EElldssttar,
	hhholld up! Heeree!&rdquo; Parakarry&rsquo;s teeth clacked in his
	head and his fingers trembled, holding a photocopied version of the
	bulletin. </font>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Booigi&rsquo;s

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Parakarry
	desperately rubbed his arms together for warmth. &ldquo;It started

	Okay here is a better way to put it. In a monarchy, does the

	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A heavily
	loaded yellow school bus rocked and squeaked on its way from
	'Bowser' Badlands, a remote portion of Dark Land abandoned by the
	Koopa Troop since their last blunder of a complete Mushroom World
	takeover. The National Koopa Scouts of Dark Land claimed it cheaply,
	prime territory for little Darklandians to be taught the ways of
	survival away from modern amenities. Climate change brought rain
	there a lot, swamping it up for the boys and girls, though the
	severe storm that ripped through last night was a little out of the
	ordinary, making the rural stretch of road from there to Neo Bowser
	City extra muddy and cluttered with debris.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	classic campfire song 'Ain't No Fly Guys on Us' blared in the ears
	of one particularly broody scout as he kicked his feet and mumbled
	along. The prince dropped his gaze to his sash covered with weighty
	badges, wondering what was the point. His father signed a waiver so
	that he could be as any other scout, free to run and scream and get
	dirty and gross. The problem was that camp only lasted overnight
	when school was in. After those precious few hours, some of which
	were 'wasted' during the sleepover aspect as staying up late was not
	permitted, he was heading back home, back to being babied all day,
	back to being the source of gossip and hushed talk behind his back
	and junk..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Their
	Scoutmaster stationed behind the driver twisted around.. &quot;Wow!
	That was our best rendition yet!&quot; Also the twentieth in a row,
	the boomerang bro muttered, borrowing the GPS from the red eyed
	buzzy beetle driver. To his concern there was heavy damage even as
	they crawled closer to urbanization. In some spots there were only
	foundations left! &quot;Kids stay in your seats, we're almost to our
	first stops. Remember what we learned about weather?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;The
	rain clouds get angry and then dance around in a circle!&quot; a
	spiny scout way in the back answered.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Thaaaat's
	right! It's called a tornado. Oh and here's..&quot; The scoutmaster
	blinked at it again. &quot;..Here's Scout Junior's stop coming up.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	Junior strapped his oversized backpack on and loitered out, staring
	at his toes the entire time. Suddenly his left foot was dangling
	over the edge of a deep crevasse in the ground. The tyke staggered
	backward before he plunged into Bowser Castle's empty moat. Across
	from where the draw bridge would connect was a huge pile of stone
	and brick rubble. Junior gaped speechlessly until something swept
	him off his feet.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Careful
	over there son! Are you alright? Good!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A battle
	tank was flipped upside down and wedged over the moat, creating a
	bridge for the father and son to cross. Amidst the pile were exposed
	stairs going down. The thick iron cages of the dungeon were swung
	wide open and standing in the walkways in between them were Morton,
	Larry, Roy, Wendy, also some guardians, Kamek and Kammy, and some
	castle staff, lastly 'momma' Peach. Sheets and flipped mattresses
	were leaning against the walls in a tent formation.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser's
	pointer claw darted around, doing a count while Junior remained in
	his other arm, his questions ignored. &quot;Okay. Er, right. We're
	rolling out. Once we find everybody we're sending Peach back!&quot;
	Their murmurs of concertation made him growl. &quot;What's the
	problem? We're supposed to sit here and wait for them to find US? We
	gotta regroup, find a new castle, other stuff, you know the drill!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Wait
	a minute daddy!&quot; Wendy skipped over. &quot;If we split up, can
	I lead a group and communicate with codes and stuffs?-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Morton
	joined his big sister. &quot;So that we may be informed, harmonious,
	on the same page.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	soured more. Bereaved of his commander Ludwig, this was a hot mess.
	Larry and Roy shared an exasperated look over their sibling's showy
	behavior, particularly Wendy. Just an hour ago she was sobbing
	hysterically over her 'precious' things trashed and what her school
	friends might say.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;We're
	sticking together! No!&quot; Bowser declared. &quot;Now get out!!!&quot;
	He scanned the dungeon one last time for stragglers, jolting a
	little at how suddenly the princess was upon him inches away. She
	was baggy-eyed, otherwise normal considering how far she fell. Must
	be that pretty armor.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
	have my condolences for this natural disaster and I hope you locate
	everyone. Sincerely. Now if I am free, why don't I remain here with
	Toadsworth for rescue?&quot; she prodded gently.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I'd
	rather you stick with me too, Hotness.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Her
	polite fa&ccedil;ade evaporated. &quot;You cannot hold us captive
	until you locate each and every soldier! How long will that take?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;..As
	long as it needs!&quot; He slung her over his shoulder before. &quot;We
	all get to suffer together! If your old man needed some attention, I
	might change my mind, but he didn't make it. Sorry!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-He
	did , you brute!&quot; she fussed up the stairs.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Whatever
	you wanna believe.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	King's bedroom was the first to sway, forces dumping him off his
	bed. He smashed an alarm to send everyone to the lowest elevation
	possible, assuming it was a volcanic eruption. With all the
	occupants of the castle at that time stumbling paces behind him,
	Bowser lit the oil lamps with his fire breath. One revealed the
	prisoner that had been there already. There was no helping him. That
	person was Toadsworth, and he had expired.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Or not
	anymore judging by chest moments of the body on the mattress. What
	the?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Now he
	had to do it. When she requested Larry accompany her, he worried a
	lot less. He was as sneaky as her, making them evenly matched. She
	didn't know what she was up against.</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	reunited with his tawdry Troop in the front lawn, diminished by
	three. Kammy picked her robe up by the hem and performed a dance,
	holding them up for five minutes. Kamek would not allow them to
	leave her behind.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;WHAT'S
	THE POINT OF THIS?!&quot; Bowser exploded.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kammy
	concluded, patting the sweat off her forehead with a stank face.
	&quot;Bring rain, Lord Bowser. It will be a wash out. It takes time
	for effect but it will come ROLLING in and it will bring your
	minions with it!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	yawned, highly skeptical. The magikoopas didn't have their scepters
	anymore than his hammer bros their hammers, or his koopas and
	goombas their Mario-brother-obliterating-on-contact force fields.
	They were pretty darn sad wandering around, disoriented without
	landmarks. Eventually the only arial baddie present volunteered. The
	paragoomba Hippity Hop was a nervous flier, but Roy inventively used
	his Koopa Ball winning throws to launch him in the air. The baddie
	wailed on the way up and down. After many rounds he regretted
	signing up for, Hippity flew erratically in a northerly direction.
	They followed the dot in the sky all the way to a village.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Some of
	the Troop cheered prematurely as they dispersed into the semi-rural
	neighborhood, air redolent of recently stirred dust and nothing
	else. No pungent whiffs of burnt materials, no sickening odor of
	death. The stone construction homes were empty, no movement until
	reaching a tall purple bloodwood tree, ragged scraps of cloth and
	other unrecognizable strings swinging limply from its branches.
	Hippity landed at the base of it.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;King!
	(Darn it, I was tryina get away from you lunatics..) I found someone
	up there!&quot; he straightened up and reported.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Ooh
	ooh ooh I can assist!&quot; Morton barged ahead, knocking Hippity
	aside. He gripped the trunk and shook the tree out its roots. Roy
	griped something about the wrong technique until a body splat on the
	floor. The koopas gathered at the lakitu in a weathered balaclava,
	J.D. otherwise known as Bowser's eleventh sentry.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;We
	have another casualty, Lord Bowser,&quot; Kamek lamented.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Weakly,
	Sentry 11 rolled himself over, flashing them a smile with a tooth
	missing. &quot;Not yet. Always of service.. Boss. And good thing you
	sent.. Prince Lawrence&hellip; away.&quot; He unballed his fist and
	a paper tumbled out, bumping Junior's toe.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	six-year-old couldn't read it; they didn't teach that style in
	school anymore. Bowser however pored over the cursive easily,
	especially since he wasn't the one who scribbled it.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
	dropped onto a granite rock for a breather, his head spinning so
	wildly he was amazed it remained attached. The trio made it
	uneventfully one of three bordering kingdoms of Dark Land. Sky Land
	was lush and cheery, a facsimile of the Mushroom Kingdom, only less
	developed and with an extra abundance of thick clouds and lots of
	monuments in seemingly random spots. He knew why the princess
	insisted on this route. Pipe Land and Ice Land with their oceans and
	chilling weather or tricky navigation, possessed complications not
	worth adopting. At all.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The way
	the princess paced nervously ahead, he knew it was time to move
	again. The Chancellor was proving to be extra baggage, literally as
	Larry carried him over his shoulder. The princess would offer to
	help but he was too much a gentleman, see. At least he was for
	today..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	followed her downhill through knee high grass. The terrain consisted
	of identical hills, like they were stuck in a looping auto scroller,
	the only references indicating otherwise being the valley areas
	where clouds dipped and created foggy white barriers impenetrable to
	the eye. All Peach did was march along. Any of his questions beget
	an abashed or somber response. He didn't know what had went down
	from their letters back and forth to now. Well, the castle went
	down, but what did she care? What did Larry even care? His physical
	belongings were gone which sucked hard, but he already had an online
	friend to crash with later. It'd be great to be away from their old
	Koopa Dynasty artifacts and treasures, like the dragon koopa eating
	its own tail. That Ouroboros was his least favorite for sure, not to
	mention he just plain didn't get it.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A buzz
	went off from within his shell. It was his old junky phone ringing
	from a weird caller id that appeared to be a jumbled up URL.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hey
	it's.. uh.. L4rry if you're a cute girl, nonyabusiness if you
	ain't.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Lol,
	you'll make an exception for me won't you? It's Lemmy. We can talk
	because your handmedown had this high technical sciencey thing!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-The
	Darklandian space communications protocol, SCPS-SP, using voice over
	IP as instituted when Mayor Koton was elected in Neo Bowser City,&quot;
	the other person stridently filled in, &quot;fully operational
	because I assisted in the development! Dang, I should have earned
	royalties by now..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Never
	before were Lemmy and Iggy so pleasant to hear, though it was funny
	about that network coming in clutch. People at school would clown
	you for using that. Meant you couldn't afford the Mushroom centric
	brands..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
	retrieved the phone. &quot;Anyway, Larry are you okay? Crazy stuff
	happened last night.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
	checked for Peach. She'd left him behind somewhat, reading a stone
	obelisk or monument ahead. &quot;I'm alright. Where you all at?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;We're
	way up in a tower using Iggy's headset to see you from like a
	million miles away. Okay not that much. Where's King Dad and
	everyone else?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
	hesitated. &quot;Finding folks. Is Luddy with y'all? Cause that'll
	be the last of the family missing.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yep!
	We'll explain it all. Keep going north. K. Bye.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yo,
	don't hang up on me!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Did

	King Dad's dumbphone had this feature too! Good thing it was from a

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Parakarry
	and Booigi hovered before an unmarked building East of Toad Town.
	Pedestrian and mushroom guard alike passed them by many times. Many
	seemed to be heading to Royal Raceway for a reason the mail carrier
	couldn't fathom. This entire scenario was pretty cursed from the
	start. To think that the public would turn on Mario? To think that
	Parakarry's resistance to that would get him noticed by a third
	party that he'd never known existed in Toad Town despite living here
	his entire life? That he'd get stuffed into a trunk at least twice?
	Should have called in sick..</font></p>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
	entered a dark square room. The wood floor was hollow, evident when
	the parakoopa dropped to his feet and knocked on one of the blank
	walls.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A hidden
	panel slid to the side. &quot;Password? -Ugh it's you. Forget the
	rules? You temporalily replace the jobs of two or three of my spies
	that are out of action, and I don't tell the King's guards that you
	helped Mario escape. Your next task isn't until 16:05 unless,
	actually..&quot; The man rummaged around in the void behind the
	wall. &quot;There you go. Get it to so and so by 14:45. Scram.&quot;
	He tossed a wrapped conical package Parakarry's way, bopping off of
	him and plunking to the floor.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I'm
	done being blackmailed. What's the aim of your organization?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A bamboo
	shaped dart gun appeared in his window. &quot;Classified. I can
	always decommission you instead.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Immediately
	it was yanked out of his hands by an invisible force. &quot;You are

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	tend to have that effect.&quot; Booigi reappeared, phasing their arm
	through the wall to snatch the spy agent out into the main room.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Within
	their grasp, the person, revealed as a green camouflage shy guy,
	death stared behind his mask. &quot;Do all the parlor tricks you
	want. You and the flaky mailman.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;What
	is this?&quot; For effect, Parakarry showed S.G. the duplication of
	the secret telegram.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Spy Guy
	shrugged them off. &quot;Internal matters. Nothing to do with your
	orders. The King taking over affects us too you know.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;He-&quot;

	You got what you wanted??&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No.
	I'm not your new fetchperson yet,&quot; Booigi declared dapperly.</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Booigi's
	first task was just a bit daunting if they were themselves, but
	trivial in their current state. The guards that once left them
	cowering were mere obstacles to phase through now. Booigi in fact
	did that a couple of times which left the victim dazed, not that
	they ever turned back to revel. Around the Lil Oink farm were posted
	pink banners from before, recruitments for upcoming 'palace'
	service. Odd. There were a lot of little eggs gathered behind the
	pens, the farmer not collecting yet. That ignited a spark for the
	boo, a clash of memories from both halves of the duality. They did
	make an additional friend yesterday. Also famously green.</font></p>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Hello.
	Who is this? ..Well, Mr. or Mrs. Unknown Number, I'm judicious about
	sharing mine so I certainly know you?&quot; The caller's voice was
	professional if a little phlegmed up, heavily accented even like an
	old Mushroomite from the more rural locations where well-to-do
	citizens lived in classical mushroom homes on large forestry plains,
	contently alienated from the urbanization of Toad Town.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Why
	aren't you here, Mr. Munchakoopas?&quot; Booigi realized they'd
	better try to speak like Boo more. Needed more ellipses in there.
	And more 'likes'.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Ah.
	I've never heard you over the line before, Boo!&quot; he laughed.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Answer
	the question! ..I mean.. the princess is k-kidnapped.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi's
	gasp was followed by the clash of a shattered dish in the background
	and animal barking. &quot;Excuse me..&quot; The barking subsided. &quot;I
	refused to believe that was the culmination of our adventure
	yesterday! Don't pull my leg. I know I was told to leave and I've
	been here on the Island disconnected from-&quot; The speaker made a
	brushing sound. More distantly, Booigi heard the dinosaur mutter,
	&quot;What is she doing back already? Oh hel-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	thought we agreed to not let Poochy indoors?&quot; It was husky yet

	become reunited with his physical manifestation. That was
	improbable- he knew that, but the only thing propelling him through
	the unfathomably vast heavens, withstanding the pelt of star bits,
	escaping the tug of black holes, thoroughly scanning galaxies for
	sentient activity, until he could find ANYONE of assistance.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	school of lumas traveling in dense formations were likely not, bless
	their little hearts though for tying.. He encountered them around
	some prankster comet and they bustled like busy children chattering.
	A purple luma presented him with unintelligible squeaks, doing what
	appeared to be an imitation of his bombastic father to bemuse him.
	It spun rapidly on its axis and transformed into a sling star,
	shooting him through the galaxy.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He landed
	hard on a grey mass the size of a small meteor, oblong with jagged
	giant bones jutting the ground. That startled him to his feet.
	Plaques and graveyard stones were embedded, a near sun bleaching it
	all in red, including a body laying against one of them, a boo
	intact except for one of their arms severed from the elbow down. An
	inch above where the sinew was broken was a marking, a Koopa Troop
	tattoo, except the temporary ones they gave to temps.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The boo
	jolted upright. &quot;AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!&quot;

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;The

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo wrung
	him by the neck and dragged him down to his level. &quot;Your
	soldiers burnt down my home! Your brothers scared Sam and Slam out
	of their shop so I couldn't even get revenge on them for roping me
	into your crap! Then YOU followed me out of the kingdom, shot at me,
	and stole my most prized possession! Now we're here. This isn't even
	limbo, bro. We're space junk!&quot; He shoved the disembodied
	koopaling away. Ludwig tripped over a stone and fell on his butt,
	amazed and frightened at once at how Zoo succeeded at giving him a
	pain response, or any response when nothing conclusively had until
	this point.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
	mustn't see it that way! I summoned you with the intention of
	acquiring your account. In the chance-medley I was mentally
	compromised and lost track of the team I sent to catch you...&quot;
	he trailed. &quot;Did you locate Star Temple?&quot; he sprung forth.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The dark
	boo stared off into space irritably. &quot;Nah. I don't wear a skin
	suit to scrub marble floors! I remember when my family moved from
	some awesome big house to a backwoods cabin to keep weirdos like me
	away from everybody!&quot; he crudely laughed at himself. &quot;I
	always vowed I'd be back to that standard someday. Drew did after
	all.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I'm
	not seeking it for occupation!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Good.
	I need something full-time that'll give me weekends. How else will I
	find time to kill people, and or co-workers?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Uh.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Go

	again, he can piss off too.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	gulped hard, a vestige reflex when he was literally not in mortal
	danger. Thank whatever stars were still watching that he got out of
	the entertainment business where he might encounter people like
	Lemmy. He found that 'Sam' person, noticing movement behind a column
	of bones. Ludwig located the Chancellor of the Mushroom Kingdom soon
	enough at the more pointed edge of the planetoid. 'Samuel'
	Toadsworth appeared as himself, dressed spiffily, with his cane
	standing and even waiting patiently as if his Sunday morning ride
	would show anytime soon to pluck him from this icky deathly place
	and shuttle him down to the quaint little market.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Bygones
	are bygones, young man,&quot; he preemptively told Ludwig as there
	was a dazzling light at the far corner of the planetoid.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Roger.
	Yeah, oh, scratch that, we have three lost souls now,&quot; droned
	the being into his receiver. Ludwig had to remember to fix his eyes
	a certain way, so as to perceive his form. It was a star warrior
	larger than any of the little stars he'd encountered until now. &quot;I
	need to get you cats to the Grandmaster Galaxy by 893:033.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Screw
	you!&quot; Zoo yelled from the other side.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The star
	warrior shook his head in pity. &ldquo;Think that dealio over. Your
	physical bodies aren&rsquo;t empty vessels out there like they&rsquo;re
	supposed to be. &lsquo;Miss Rosie&rsquo; said she&rsquo;ll show up
	and discuss-&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hullo!

	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Don&rsquo;t

	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Something
	or someone meddled with you all before you three-&rdquo; the star
	warrior (&#9825;&#9834;!?) made a chopping motion. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s
	as far as I can tell you now. Don&rsquo;t worry about that one. We
	can leave him. He has forever to get over that attitude. In this

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Need

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad

	let it slip to the floor.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
	event was going to have a turnout surpassing a Star Festival! It was
	conjecture that the Mushroom King wanted to bring fresh faces to his
	palace at Poshley Heights, spooked by how easily the Koopa Troop
	could snatch his daughter from under Mario&rsquo;s nose practically,
	but she wasn&rsquo;t going to be there to document any official
	proceedings it if she couldn&rsquo;t even beg Peach&rsquo;s castle
	toads for permission while they were cooped up in that hideous Hotel
	Mario. She was forbidden by Snifit Patrol and league. The snufit
	even threatened that if he wasn&rsquo;t stationed to guard the
	castle grounds, he&rsquo;d do something about that &lsquo;stolen&rsquo;
	kart she was driving. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
	left- Well she wasn&rsquo;t so keen on Kinopio-Kun&rsquo;s blog.
	Digital territory was uncharted. She had dyslexia, that is how she
	obtained her reputation for daringly jumping into the middle of
	everything. Way easier to write about it if you were there compared
	to skimming through other sap&rsquo;s experience. Poor excuse.. That
	didn&rsquo;t stop her writing her Koopa Kronicle or a whole gosh
	darn novel. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It was
	time to hunt around for the web browser icon on her phone and check
	it out. Kinopio was a PR person whose content as an &lsquo;influencer&rsquo;
	was flagrantly monitored by the Toadstools. How could Kylie forget
	when a person she was dating at the time- regrettably, was the
	reason that contemporary position was invented in a place as hoary

	it&rsquo;s just a package. That&rsquo;s too much to accept?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jon
	rolled his eyes at the woman. &ldquo;Could be dangerous, eh,&rdquo;
	he said, twirling the yellow flattish bubble mailer around. It was
	addressed to the &lsquo;Castle Manager&rsquo; in cut and glued
	newspaper letters.. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Just like

	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It
	woulda blown up by now, haha..&rdquo; Bridget quipped. She got
	whacked again. &ldquo;I wish Ben was still here. You suck!&rdquo;
	she shot back.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie was
	about ready to jump out and hurt somebody when Boo ran off down the

	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Psst.
	Some of those King&rsquo;s guards make ya wanna commit treason,
	don&rsquo;t they? You okay? Hop in.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thank

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo

	but not the castle out of a toad. Here he was occupying himself with
	anything to not go crazy, including volunteer nursing duties. He
	escorted Dr. Toad to an overgrown plot of land with a wooden barn
	painted deep red. And unexpectedly large metal shutter door took up
	the entire front wall. Despite that the doctor beside him, cityboy
	as he appeared made no comment- or eye contact. The gate rose by six
	inches, bushy green leaves rustling against it.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Howdy.

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad

	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...Nailed

	activated something inside the barn that was close to the door. A
	shrill noise and flash went off causing something to explode in
	there. Smoke billowed from under the gate.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Whoa,
	what the freaking heck??&rdquo; the nurse laughed as well.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Don&rsquo;t
	mind it. A Mecha-Yoshi needs a tweak.&rdquo; Vick slid a beige old
	looking telephone under the door.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The nurse
	smirked at the doctor that had leapt high in the air and landed in
	his arms after the blast. &ldquo;..Can I put you down now?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">From the
	first magnanimous greeting from &lsquo;Mr. X&rsquo;, the nurse knew
	he was someone that wasn&rsquo;t always a Mushroomite, but was now.
	Dr. Toad stuttered through simple stuff like his name, which he
	blurted out initially as Drew L. Diddley-</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~Where
	had that been seen before?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-The
	doctor swiftly corrected that his professional title was Dr. Toad
	and the CEO remained patient and kind through the rest of that
	stilted call. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A coldish
	hand surprised the nurse on his shoulder. &ldquo;Complete.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	&lsquo;nurse&rsquo; lifted his head, having tuned out. &ldquo;Y-yeah?
	Yeah. What time is it?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
	raised his right wrist, raising one eyebrow. &ldquo;Three-Twenty
	Eight. Did I loiter?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	gasped. &ldquo;No, just take two lefts, a right, a left again, right
	right left, backwards, forwards. Then you&rsquo;re there. Bye!&rdquo;
	The blue toad broke into a sprint, his medical mask flying off. The
	round face of Bucken-Berry flushed deeply. If he didn&rsquo;t reach
	the ICU in two minutes he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to see his friend
	Ala-Gold again before the planned last-ditch surgery.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Even if
	it worked of course, he'd not hear his shy low voice for a while, if
	ever.</font></p>

&lsquo;Hillbilly Hail -fun I promise.
	Seriously help! ( )&rsquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Now that
	was something the junior assistant could check on the lists
	secretary Jr. Troopa habitually passed out. She joined the gaiety of
	the unorthodox ice bucketing procedure for the Mario brothers. The
	supervising Jr. Troopa was mindful of the spectators that weren&rsquo;t
	his staff, leaning over the thin picket fence surrounding a small
	spot with hay fiber substrate and crowing as if they were watching a
	petting zoo at that. This was serious! Luigi silently endured his
	shivering. Mario was more distracted at how Jr. Troopa had matured
	since the last time he&rsquo;d seen him, now a stretched out adult,
	brown coily hair instead of that egg shell..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
	perfectly normal looking, and thus out of place here, nurse named
	Laki scampered to Troopa. &ldquo;Yo. Those crazy paper things were
	spotted again!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jr.
	Troopa paled. He wrote a note on scrap paper, handed it to the
	nearest nurse, and departed with the noki. His absence brought on an
	immediate shift, especially when the podoboo toting the note
	scorched it by mistake. The ranchers and villagers began to press
	inwards on the Marios in curiosity.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Ain&rsquo;t
	that there Mario fella wanted up North?&rdquo; they&rsquo;d say.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The air
	stirred next to Luigi. His brother bolted and he did too.
	Unfortunately the fence wasn&rsquo;t just for hecklers, but a
	barrier from all sorts of dangers, like the thing that made Mario
	ten paces ahead vanish. Luigi stopped just in time and leaned over
	the precipice. His brother uncontrollably tumbled down a metal
	drainage half pipe. Without thinking he plunged with him. They were
	ejected miles away on damp clay like soil. They rolled to a stop
	against a copper colored wall.<br/>
&hellip;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
	locomotive horn jolted Luigi awake. The next thing Luigi remembered
	was a tall metal water tower glinting in the sunlight. He rolled and
	saw a jagged rock of Mt. Rugged. The K64 station was known to be up
	there somewhere. Something else ensnared his attention then, his
	brother quivering next to him.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">M-mario!?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Remaining
	curled up, he held a discolored spot on his forehead. &ldquo;Ouch.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	crawled over, ignoring the painful rocks. &ldquo;Bro. This is so
	bad. I mean I&rsquo;ll get you help but- oh man. I wanted us to get
	to Bowser Castle before dark!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	lifted upwards. On closer inspection he was otherwise okay, aside
	from tattered clothes. &ldquo;You can be there pronto with The
	Captain. Cool Blue is busy.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	woefully plopped beside him. &quot;Scratch that proposition. Weren't
	you coming??&quot; At his brother's silence, he scooped up and slung
	a rock hard against the mountain face. It made a faint thunk.
	&quot;Mario, a shortcut to World 8 isn't even that far from here.
	Come on, we made it out of Toad Town against all odds. Don't you
	see? Everyone will see you're helping and -Oh look so you aren't
	secretly villainous like the stupid tabloids say! PR disaster
	averted and you can finally retire in peace. I'm supposed to be
	doing the legwork right? So.&quot; He choked up. &quot;Go with me.
	Please. I don't want to do this without you..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	expected to turn and see something ugly. Instead Mario's palm was on
	his forehead. &quot;Yep.. Everything you're thinking, yep. The
	message-boards, the commentators, they're also right on one thing.
	In the midst of this, I was infatuated with my rival!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The world
	seemed to melt around the green plumber, muttering to himself, &quot;Mio
	fratello mi ha detto.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Yeah,
	and it's over. Or- er, it's not going to cloud my judgement ever
	again.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	stood up, face to face with him.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Bowser
	not caring.. sometimes it's admirable, but he doesn't know limits.
	We do, and he's seventeen years older than us. Bout time he learns
	this lesson.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	smiled cathartically. &quot;Of course.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Need
	a moment?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Nah,
	big bro.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">As they
	retraced their path using that deathtrap drainage thing as a
	zigzagging guide, Mario as usual filled the air primarily, though
	something was different about his dryish humor and definitely the
	topic. Luigi assumed he was purging the senselessness he could
	during this half time- the sort of episodes their games skipped.
	They came upon a fractured concrete podium in the middle of nowhere,
	labeled ostro stop in a western font. It seemed to be targeting
	citizens departing the K64 as a pole with a wire from it leading to
	a powerline was stamped with bulletins and flyers from businesses
	and events in town.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Hey,
	what was the draw?&quot; Luigi asked as Mario spammed a buzzer for
	service.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	brightened in recollection. &quot;Strength. Ambition. Esteem for
	family. Cooking.. I know.. And if you're in that narrow range that
	he cares about he's super fair. His bottom line is that you can do
	what he wants you to do, not who or what you are.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	see.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yeah.
	...Luigi, thank you for listening. You coulda reacted a lotta ways
	and I'd deserve it, so thanks for your patience too. You had
	yourself figured out way before me...&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A great
	feeling in turn waft over the younger brother. &quot;Mario, no.
	Thank you for letting me.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~He'd
	promised he'd never get resentful long ago, and it wasn't going to
	change now, whether over a trivial or mountain sized dispute. It
	wasn't like anything in this life would top their Papa giving Mario
	both brass keys to their plumbing shop. If they were Cain and Abel
	before then, that sealed it- he thought at least. They never shared
	a shift. They lived on opposite sides of Brooklyn even. And that
	wasn't easy then. Luigi just happened to pick up the phone and come
	over like his brother begged when 'something freaky was going on
	with the pipes'. Mario wasn't usually that humble to admit he
	couldn't fix things. Well, through all they'd been to get here, on
	the cusp of forty and each other's best friend, he'd gotten that
	brass key, and there was </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">nothing</font></em>
	<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">holding him
	back.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-I
	heard it the first time, dern it! It's busted.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	sheepishly lifted his finger from the buzzer. Staring at the back of
	the red shelled koopa in a blue janitorial jumper, dithering over
	which broom to reach for in his service cart, it was clear how he'd
	appeared on the spot so stealthily.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;They
	made you fly out here to tell us? Cabbie or not, I almost feel I
	should compensate you anyway.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He peeped
	over his shoulder again, staggering in recognition. &quot;Shoot..&quot;
	He dropped the broom. &quot;Howdy, I'm Probabilly K. Listen here,
	our local wacko Vick, bless his heart, sprout these here stops
	evrywhere' without using high speed cabling to the signal box. I can
	help ya out anyway, specially this un.&quot; He lifted his right
	arm's sleeve to the elbow, revealing a faded with age L emblem
	tattoo. &quot;Us less popular siblings gotta stick for one nuther.
	Whatcha need Mr. Hero?...&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;...Oh,
	right, me. We appreciate it,&quot; Luigi spoke up, awkwardly.
	&quot;Here's what we're doing...&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">As his
	brother spoke to the old parakoopa, Mario processed how light his
	chest felt. Asthma be darned, it was easier to breathe if all of
	these invisible problems weren't like a millstone around his neck.</font></p>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The blue

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The other
	pianta, Hotel Delfino&rsquo;s day supervisor, waddled over to the
	parapet with him, squinting and shielding his face from the sun
	partially. The shimmering Dolphin Ocean stretched out as far as one
	could see, marred only by some darkness on the horizon. &ldquo;Feel
	it in the bones too, brah.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Not

	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">About a
	nautical mile away, there were two sumo bros drifting in a leaking
	foam inflatable raft surrounded by hungry sushi. One of the
	eccentrically clothed twins was a bump on a log while the other
	steadily pumped out water. Behind them was a mound of objects
	covered by a black tarp, strapped to the raft with cords.
	Unambiguously to the piantas, that was what weighed them down. </font>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sammy

	cape. &quot;Wowzers. Are there yet?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	younger dragon/koopa Slamondon chored himself to acknowledge him.
	&ldquo;Nay. Not enough drag accounted for in thy math as usual,&rdquo;
	he groaned. He held the hem of his magikoopa robe to tip toe towards
	their luggage. He was also a hardcore enthusiast, much like Sam was
	of sci-fi supervillain Darth Koopa from </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Star
	Slammers</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">,

	<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">thing.
	Ommmmmm!&rdquo; Sam squeezed his eyelids shut and plugged both ears.
	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	milquetoast younger brother sat his uncomfortably wet tush down and
	bide. The trip from Neo Bowser City so so-called paradise vacation
	was in complete turmoil. At this stage in life, a semester away from
	graduation, Slam despised his role as his brother&rsquo;s sitter.
	While Sam could divine the most absurd and find the hypotenuse in a
	blink, he had not mastered tasks of an elementary sort, like paying
	light bills on time. Otherwise, Slam could have taken his forty
	percent share of their Play-N-Tirade franchise and ran off to open
	the renaissance park he always wanted. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A jet ski
	tore through the waters, tearing him from that reverie. The rider
	aimed around a handheld harpoon to scare away the sharks. &ldquo;Aloha.&rdquo;
	She waved, a cute gal in a purple patterned bikini, white flowery
	necklace draped loosely over her shoulders. &ldquo;Need help?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Aye
	f-fair madame,&rdquo; Slam stammered, blushing. &ldquo;Saveth us, we
	have bountiful treasures aboard this ship!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sam
	peeped one eye open with a smug grin. &ldquo;-Oh hi totally hot
	lifeguard I summoned.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~Actually
	Hotel Delfino called me on you two, hehe.&rdquo; She dropped the
	charade and murmur. &ldquo;(Cause if it was YOU calling me on you, I
	wouldna shown up.)&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sam gave
	her a tauntingly dorkish laugh. &ldquo;Suuure? I dunno, I just felt
	like being rescued by a &lsquo;Valerie&rsquo;. 27. Born in a winter
	month like Rebmeced? Who studies finance abroad at Mushroom Collage
	and just bought a B-Dasher in red and whose boyfriend just got
	arrested for...&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Her jaw
	dropped expression mirrored Slam&rsquo;s. His brother&rsquo;s hubris
	never led to anything easily undone.</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
	happened, brah??&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh

	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	bellhop held the door open for the dripping wet sumo bros, inviting
	them into the moodily lit lobby inundated with waiting vacationers
	of all sorts. Slam got them onto land in the first place by stuffing
	his brother&rsquo;s mouth with one of those body pillows so that he
	couldn&rsquo;t freak out the six rescuer in a row. By then however,
	the twelve o&rsquo;clock checkouts were out and these innumerable
	other folk were ready to pounce. The sumo bros were prompted to
	utilize the ticket dispenser.</font></p>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sam slid
	up his glasses, too adept at calculations to fathom that number
	waiting in here, let alone the entire hemisphere. It had to be a
	glitch. Slam caught a devious gleam behind his brother&rsquo;s
	naturally cloudish eyes and detected trouble, redux! </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The desk

	slapped down the error ticket, puffing out his thick chest. &ldquo;But

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The stamp
	slipped from the pianta&rsquo;s mits.. &ldquo;Ooooh that, my
	apologies sir, I remember everything you are talking about.&rdquo;
	He cradled a landline phone between his shoulder and neck while
	simultaneously clacking on his computer. &ldquo;I will find space,
	sir. Uh, please in the meantime help yourself to the bar. On the
	house. Mention my name.&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sam broke
	off to the adjacent tiki bar, taking up two stools as he ordered one
	of everything. As the bartender worked away Slam sat beside him,
	struggling to find the stool with the neon lights everywhere.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	dare say you dazzle even me now,&rdquo; he whispered in his ear. He
	cherished these magical moments when that giant gob of Sam&rsquo;s
	actually did something favorable. -Like when Sam manipulated that
	dark boo reporter into passing around Fungus Up yesterday. They were
	out that wretched Toad Town so quickly it was like they&rsquo;d
	dropped a potion at their feet and they went &lsquo;poof&rsquo;.
	Slam propped his elbow on the bar and leaned on it, not a partaker
	of the &lsquo;dizzying elixirs&rsquo; as he put it, watching the
	sports bar tv on MKNN. On the bottom banner, intertwined with stalk
	market data, it mentioned &lsquo;Public Address&rsquo; at Toad Town
	today. Blech!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sam
	slammed his empty glass down. &ldquo;Urp! .. Hey, lemme have our
	shop wire our Princess Parlor profits over.&rdquo; His fat fingers
	dialed their Play-N-Tirade number as additional fruity looking
	cocktails were lined up for him. &ldquo;No answer, but coolio I&rsquo;ll
	leave a message. Now, let&rsquo;s catch up with Iggster!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Once upon
	a time, Sky Land was known as the kingdom with the most marvelous
	view of the stars. As the composition of the atmosphere changed,
	those celestial bodies were blotted gradually. Increasingly common
	cloud coverage draped their land and their spirits. One day the
	people channeled all their might, one-hundred laborious years, to
	reach the astral realm they revered and contain it for themselves
	with a spiraling limestone tower taller than any before. The King
	and his domestics from greatest to least discarded their terrene
	life. The tower was thus made inaccessible from intruders and the
	land at its base to go rural, though it could still be seen near the
	coast. It was known as an impervious but awesome sight.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
	Koopa brought it into focus from another altitudinous, but not
	nearly as much, tower of enemy origin a few miles away with a
	coin-operated telescope. Iggy&rsquo;s VR headset ran out of power.
	The lankier younger brother would know, because he swapped the
	battery from it to his cellphone to keep it running a little longer.
	It paid off when it chimed suddenly of &lsquo;Super Plumber Sonata&rsquo;,
	his ringtone from Koopa Ball Z. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He took
	one step- and forgot his leg was sprung. He tripped forward,
	knocking the cellular phone off of the rail and down the very long
	staircase below. It flumped around for what felt like five minutes. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
	stared down the shaft long enough to get vertigo.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
	totally okay Lemmy-sama. I had an intemperate glass installed.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
	mean temperate glass?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
	turned to him with concern. &ldquo;Is your head still feeling
	funny?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yep.
	Still a scratched DVD suffering loss of data integrity and
	sputtering right before the best part.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">..Maybe
	Ludwig on the ground floor is doing better..&rdquo; The rainbow hair
	koopaling shrunk another inch. He was praying he wouldn&rsquo;t have
	to be the sole one to break it to Larry, Bowser, virtually everyone
	about last night.</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">At the
	Hotel Defino tiki bar, there was nothing going on except for Sammy
	winning coins in bets over guessing stranger&rsquo;s underwear
	colors.<br/>
Embarrassed second hand, Slam lifted his hood over his
	head. Thunder was rumbling and through one window he saw staff
	chaining down the beach chairs outside. Solar sensing night lights
	were scattered on the beach. Meanwhile, Sam&rsquo;s phone buzzed on
	the counter from Iggy&rsquo;s number. He picked it up.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Y
	O U R P U N I S H MENT I S IM M I N E NT,&rdquo; stabbed through one

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Palm
	trees were twisting, rain was beating on the windows, and a group of
	petrified beach goers clambered indoors as the building moaned and
	creaked under high winds. The last of which, a yoshi flopped to the
	floor panting.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">High&hellip;ground
	man&hellip;high ground.. NOW!&rdquo; </font>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Slam
	obediently slid off the stool, heart thumping. He played the
	classics. Bad things happened in the Pitch Dark. He reached for Sam
	who remained slumped over the counter. Thinking he was intoxicated,
	Slam hunkered down, ready to carry him off when the emergency lights
	kicked on. The robed brother emitted a high pitched noise. From
	Sam&rsquo;s snout flowed deep crimson blood. The glimmer in his wide
	open eyes had extinguished.</font></p>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Great
	to see you. My plans have evolved from wishful thinking to reality
	and your timing is impeccable.&rdquo; Dr. Toad&rsquo;s words flowed
	smoothly, eased in the presence of the associate, fire forged to be
	a pseudo &lsquo;friend&rsquo;..maybe. This one had been a member of
	the Special World Hospital from the outset, ironically as a
	detractor and somewhat benighted at that. Presently however, he was
	the only of three Dr. Toad invited that had shown up.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That&rsquo;s
	amazing, Drew.&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
	will do the talking, will you?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	hammer brother gave the toad a thumbs up.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
	proceeded to the stage, bales of hay stacked three high with rickety
	wooden boards on top, plucked fresh from Nintendo Depot. The hammer
	brother garnered an expected reaction with his loose fitting
	doctor&rsquo;s coat that he clearly rarely wore, and his attempt at
	hiding his hippyish stringy long hair in a ponytail, but he didn&rsquo;t
	combat anything. A taciturn Dr. Toad trailed with his head down,
	hands tucked into deep pockets.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Greetings
	everyone. I&rsquo;m Dr. John Topper, but you can call me Dr. T.&rdquo;
	The jabber silenced quickly at his captivatingly excitable tone. &ldquo;-
	So I&rsquo;m with Dr. Toad here from the International Medical
	University of Special World. Our institution is lucky enough to have
	a fragment of Dr. Mario&rsquo;s case study on the first outbreak of
	the Mushroom Flu. -Yeah- uh huh? ..No, you heard me. So, in light of
	that tragic Bowser attack, we have chosen to assist you the best we
	can with that matter!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
	previously critical snickering bunch erupted in praise. Without a
	proper announcement that it adjourned, many took off right away
	giddy with news.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">By
	the way it should only take forty-four hours maximum to formulate a
	new cure!&rdquo; Dr. Topper yelled at their backs essentially. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">In the
	scuttle, they bumped the rearmost observant off the stack of library
	books he was using to watch over the cowboy hats in the crowd.
	Getting up, cursing, he would have severely hurt a few if they
	weren&rsquo;t whisked away on an ostro by now. Instead, he dusted
	himself off and snapped back to his picture perfect presentation.
	Shoving the books into his backpack he dragged it to the nearest
	public bench. The longish trip back to the library was unattractive
	and the heat of direct sunlight did not bother him. </font>

	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What,
	Jackson?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
	didn&rsquo;t tell me you have that Dr. Mario thing! Why ain&rsquo;t
	that in a museum? How? Where?&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">An
	associate yet to arrive has it. He found it in his previous job with
	Sir Grodus.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Troopa
	gasped. &ldquo;Drew, your hiring is.. Questionable.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yes,&rdquo;
	he beamed proudly, hooking his arm through the koopa&rsquo;s. &ldquo;And
	I will tell you more about it inside.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Troopa
	seemed to play along until they reached his office door. He swung it
	open, letting a few boxes spring out over their heads. &ldquo;Oops.
	We gotta problem. No room with all your junk!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	have not set the lab up yet! Geez! ..Besides my therapist told me if
	the pathways are clear I'm not a hoarder.&quot; he trailed, the door
	shutting behind them.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The toad
	watching on the bench was just about to toss a heavy book to make
	them get a room. Thankfully they had, but now there was something
	else keeping him from diving into a green bound book.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oww!
	Hey no need to push me like that&hellip;. I don&rsquo;t keep coins
	on me if that&rsquo;s &hellip; Oh that was a rental for the
	airport.. All I have is boring medical stuff stacked here, see-?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Quit,
	before we fold ya a couple times over!&rdquo; They had a southern
	affection, yet an eerily robotic timbre. After a hollow pop lots of
	glass shattered. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The toad
	hopped off the bench and rushed toward the commotion, exhilarated by
	the call of action. Blocking the entirety of the back alley space
	were humongous amalgamations paper and metal scaffolding, one an
	effigy of a goomba and a snifit in outlaw getup. Dr. Topper,
	bleached white, was laying on top of sparkly glass shards. The
	hybrid electricity coup kart had a dent in the front matching his
	shell. The Paper Macho gang members spun at the onlooker.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Stay
	outta this.&rdquo; Barked the other one, the snifit. In spite of
	their hollow emotionless gape the malice and severity was apparent.
	The observer should back off and get some help.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-No way!
	Captain Toad pretended to take a step back, then launched his heavy
	backpack at the Macho Snifit. It fired- 'pop' 'pop' 'pop' his way,
	the high velocity cork plugs bouncing off the walls. It was too
	late, The Captain was upon him grabbing and ripping the weapon
	carrying arm from the socket. The paper pieces disintegrated in his
	palm, leaving the cap gun. The Captain fired it back at the paper
	soldier, piercing holes in through its body, snapping the metal
	skeleton and striking the 'weak point' on his back. Its form
	exploded with a blast that shot the toad backwards against the
	shanty metal tiles of the office building. The macho goomba outlaw
	standing in its partner's wake had no reaction short of fleeing the
	opposite way.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">In the
	excitement of chasing, the Captain stepped over the downed hammer
	bro absently. The outlaw barged through a wooden fence and towards a
	red barn with a breach in the sliding door from being jaggedly eaten
	into. He found inside it six foot tall dinosaur robots against the
	wall deactivated, a gaming pc with multi-monitor setup, and in the
	far rear mechanical parts from vehicles, computers, farm equipment,
	and radios in rusty piles. Matching teeth marks were all of those,
	if the outlaw discovered in the middle of the pile wasn't conclusive
	enough.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	Captain spun the pop gun around his finger. The outlaw's final
	expression as it ate cork was, again, nothing at least on the
	outside.</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jr.
	Troopa was the foremost scuttling around paranoid, paw hovering over
	his own pop gun like thing in a holster on his hip, obviously too
	late. &ldquo;Laki and I didn&rsquo;t see anything conclusive at the
	first warning man. I'm so sorry!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
	only the wind knocked out of me. I used to, well, be adventurous.
	I&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo; Dr. Topper sent away the ukiki nurse.
	&ldquo;Thank you. I should have watched my back more. It&rsquo;s my
	fault really and I&rsquo;m ready to get back on track. The integrity
	of our equipment is perfect and they never touched it. I don&rsquo;t
	know who that belongs to, however.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A Pidgit
	nurse bent at a rugged backpack. &ldquo;Sir it&rsquo;s filled with
	bricks. I mean books.. Lost and found it is!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Troopa&rsquo;s
	disquietude got the best of him and decided to clean up the glass
	and paper himself, rather than try to cajole anyone else. He dropped
	the pan to the ground and got to sweeping stiffly, when he felt eyes
	on him. Lividly he lifted his head.. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	get it, Drew. I suck at this.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	doctor stepped closer. &quot;Those gangs are common are they not?
	How did you err?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Mismanagement.
	Between keeping this job with Mr. X and you- who's obviously doing
	something right in Special World here, I had to get my junior
	assistants on track, watching the gates, on the roads, keeping up on
	patients- it ain't working! Do I need to scream more? Make more
	checklists? What? I can take em on in a fight, but then I really
	know they won't work with me.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
	do have that surly old reputation.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Troopa
	felt slapped recalling that. &quot;Yeah, I know it takes time. Look
	I'm not hanging the saddle up Drew, just calling this day what it
	is. Bluesy.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Issue
	two, you are laterally challenged.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Short?!?
	But I'm still taller than I was!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;We
	can't control people's biases, unless you allow Morris to see you.
	He has an experiment that can make you six feet tall.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Troopa
	punched him.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oww!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Fine.
	Sorry!&quot; He koopa gave the toad doctor a big- overdue given the
	distance, bear hug, snout pressed against his pocket protector from
	that- ah hem, height distance. Also trying to feel him up. Not like
	that like that.. mostly, but from the lack of advancement there, he
	could indeed take Drew on too! Ha! Besides that could see through
	the white coat, and the doctor's undershirt had *gasp* some sort of
	bright pattern and color? Such progress from the old days..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Jackson,
	if this is your holistic approach I believe it might work!&quot;</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">By the
	time The Captain returned to the scene, what was left was mostly
	multicolored confetti, the kart, and-</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Oh.
	Hello&hellip; Blessings unto you gentlemen.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">While the
	doctor and koopa separated quickly, his face hardened at what wasn't
	there.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;That,
	uh, that was your backpack?&quot; Troopa asked. &quot;Sent to lost
	and found. Probabilly can let you into the lockbox after his back
	from the coast with Mario and-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Captain
	Toad wavered. &quot;The Marios have left?!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yeah..&quot;
	Jr. Troopa glanced over him, worriedly. &quot;You saved Dr. T, just
	now didn't ya?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	Captain locked onto a particular detail of the kart near the alley.
	&quot;And I ask only for this as compensation.&quot; He slipped into
	the driver's seat and slung that kart out of the alleyway.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;In
	the good ol days, Billy usta drive 'round with Jimmy M. like this..&quot;
	Probabilly chattered as the tractor-like Dragonfly vehicle putt at
	its max speed. &quot;Then the coins from the inspections came rollin
	in. They upgraded in a jiffy.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Old
	mushroom rock buzzed from the AM radio. The Keptos' 'Darkness in the
	Light' got the plumbers tapping to the beat. Everyone knew Les from
	the castle recorded that solo. A lesser known fun fact, well sorta,
	Gill T. their neighbor was the bassist, a super sheltered toad these
	days.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After one
	more dune, they were at the Desert Land peninsula. They thanked the
	paratroopa and ran the rest of the way into Water Land. The sky was
	cloudless and blue, waters calm, temperature mild.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
	searched around the pier for a bit, hunting down a golden pipe.
	Toads manning the toad houses were ordered to move them ever once in
	a while. These versions went much further than normal, a five
	kingdom stretch, and weren't meant for recreational use. Just what
	the brothers feared, there was a gold ring below the depths of the
	ocean. If the coast had simply shifted over it, or if a toad was
	very diligent one day they couldn't determine. Either way, they'd
	better get ready to hold their breaths.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	gingerly placed his hat, shoes, and socks in a watertight shoulder
	bag. &quot;...Geronimo!&quot; He made a running start off the edge.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	caught up, rolling his eyes playfully. Splashing in behind him, he
	was funneled into the metal tube as well. The trip wasn't completely
	submerged, still wild and chaotic, also quite cold. He was frozen
	stiff by the time it dumped them into another red-dyed body of
	water. He defrosted, swimming to the surface-</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Ah!&quot;
	he exclaimed at the Koopa King's humongous mug- in statue form. It
	was the dislodged entrance to Bowser Castle, the sea level to the
	statue's nostrils.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Up
	here!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	pulled Mario onto the structure. The red plumber rolled on his back,
	chest heaving. The sky was red with purple clouds and it rained in a
	mildly acidic way that didn't feel too great. It was Dark Land for
	sure. There were some higher elevations here and there, a volcano
	peak, tips of trees, otherwise nothing else but murky waters.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Ugh!&quot;
	groaned an orange toad girl paddling around on a floating painting
	with a street sign. Through the discoloration it was a forgery of
	Peach's 'Lethal Lava Land', the sort of junk sold in Neo Bowser
	City.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Luigi,
	that's Bowser's fan girl! If we got on her raft, we could take the
	pipe outta here.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;We
	want to leave?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	shrugged. &quot;Whatever happened here, Bowser's not around. I know
	it. Hey! (What was it?).. Emery!!!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	anxiously watched the girl turn around. Their golden pipe sprout
	from a dark cloud in the sky, ending about ten feet above the water,
	ready to time out and fade any moment. If Mario couldn't reason with
	this toad crazy enough to become a KT minion, they'd be stranded on
	that ugly replica of Bowser.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Mario??
	Luigi??&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yeah.
	Let us ride with you. I'll tell you a secret Bowser fact.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No
	thanks. We're like enemies now, and King can tell me whatever!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	hesitated. &quot;He wouldn't tell you about his brother..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And he
	almost had her. He saw that twinkle in the eye. Too bad, he
	suspected he'd offered too quickly. &quot;I don't believe you,&quot;
	She giggled, remaining just too far for them to jump over.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Afraid
	they'd push her off the makeshift raft? No they wouldn't, but Mario
	would readily give her the 'plumber whack' if she acted up. She did
	sign up for it. Nonetheless, she held onto self-preservation unlike
	most baddies, and there wasn't a thing they could do to her except
	reason some more.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	proceeded to in a harsh guttural language, Darklandian.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	flushed. &quot;Oh.. You know that?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Toad
	taught me in the past. Yes.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;The
	Mr. Toad? He was once with the bad guys?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No,
	but you cannot understand what you cannot communicate with. If he
	was in better health, he'd tell you a lot about the culture here. He
	might even tell you that it's in your best interest to help us
	leave. You don't want to be caught letting us go, do you?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Are
	you implying you'd snitch?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	shot up next to him. &quot;You'd bet! Minions are supposed to fight
	us on sight, so get up here girl and brawl, or let us leave and
	conveniently forget we saw ya.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	squeezed her oars, glaring. &quot;I hate you and you'll so game over
	at my hands someday.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">While she
	rowed closer, Luigi subtly nudged his brother. &quot;We'd better
	watch for her...&quot;</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">When the
	Mario brothers returned to Water Land, they knew they had major
	reformulating to do. That must have been the wetter and sloppy
	Bowser Badlands they'd visited by mistake. A screw-up somewhere in
	the warp system, or-</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Mr.
	Mario, Mr. Luigi.. Weren't you missing something on that
	expedition?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Captain
	Toad leaned against the hood of an eco-friendly bubble-shaped kart,
	his glimmering smile only making its heavy damage more suspicious.
	They stood still, puzzled. The Captain used that opportunity to
	stroll past them left and right like a little sergeant, hands
	clasped behind his back.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;..Did
	something go awry? If only you had an extra partner to accompany
	you.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	pushed past, unperturbed. &quot;Stan, Luigi and I can handle it.
	Thanks though!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	Captain stared with unbridled rage before he caught himself. &quot;But
	an adventurer needs a brigade! Besides for (spreading the blame
	during mishaps) allowing all talents to shine, extra eyes and ears
	are a protection!!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Then
	Luigi began to leave.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	Captain followed hectically. &quot;I know a way to teleport,
	straight to wherever we need to be! Including the princess!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	found his words, turning as the red toad overtook him. &quot;And how
	is that possible, Stan?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	smirked. &quot;With your linguistic capabilities. And it's Captain

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He folded
	the paper up once, then again, then several more times until it was
	a tiny square in the pocket of the husk in the waiting room. The
	wait was over, and nothing could be done for Ala-Gold like he
	thought he was prepared for. The talk with his family was pleasant
	at least. Saddened, seeking to travel over Monday, the soonest they
	could, they were proud their son went down in the war against that
	evil Bowser man..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Funny, he
	used to always be jealous that Gold had a big family back at Ricco

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hey.

	for Mr. Toad. Did anyone care about Gold like he did though? Boiling
	inside, Blue fought against the pavlovian urge to smash something.
	He should be telling the castle staff, being active. Instead he rose
	to his feet, lifted the metal chair over his head and-</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Sir
	I- Nevermind! Eeeekkk!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thomas
	screamed and ran out of the hospital entirely, which made some
	others turn and look at who remained, Bucken-Berry, like he was some
	freak. The blue toad dropped the chair and rushed outdoors as well.
	His vision blacked out from the bright sun, so that he collided face
	first into the metal sheet siding of the adjacent building. He fell
	backward into a puddle of viscous mud, toppling over a high stack of
	metal buckets with him. Many water lines were there, evident by the
	large pipes going underground and a leaky faucet.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thomas
	stepped up slowly. &quot;I was going to say something but.. I
	f-forgot...&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bucken-Berry
	leaned upwards and glared. &quot;Chill it, kid. I wasn't gonna...
	Did I look like I was gonna? Well I wasn't. Okay? Now piss off!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Doesn't
	sound like it&hellip;. Sorry again sir.&quot; Thomas quickly backed
	off, and then changed his mind. He drew something in the soil with
	his heel. &quot;I came from there and was taken by Dark Land militia
	when I was about five. It's been tough I suppose, though it did not
	dawn how much until I came here and compared my life to your kind.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bucken-Berry
	was standing by then. There was once a such thing as sanctioned
	nomads, the reason why toads could be the exceeding demographic
	nonnative areas. Etched down there was Prism Island's crest. Talk
	about remote. &quot;I'll be frank kid. I'm not in a state to get
	into toad politics, as privileged as I still am despite my
	tragedies. More so when one of them is in that building behind us.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Mr.
	Ala-Gold, for the short time I knew him, was a cool guy.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Kid,
	duh he was! He crossed over from the harbor in a canoe he carved,
	using his homemade compass too and the stars alone. He'd memorize
	level maps and let our timer run out finding hidden blocks. Mario
	would be pissed! He had this weird thing against screaming, so how
	we clicked it off I don't know&hellip;&quot; His gaze remained on
	his muddy boots. &quot;And don't regret. Look, enough yapping.
	Where's The Captain? I got beef with him, not gonna lie, but he's
	kinda meek and quiet without his brigade. He'd probably freak you
	out less to hang with.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh,
	right. That was his name, I'm bad with those sir. I was with him
	before, at the public library but, he was too passionate about the
	subject.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That's
	not a real criticism according to Toadette, Bucken-Berry thought.
	Anyway, &quot;Uh huh?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yeah
	so, I haven't seen him in a while, but his backpack is right here.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Probabilly
	had returned and the lost and found items were openly displayed
	under the hospital's front porch. Bucken-Berry ogled at several
	books, an 'Ex spatio obiecti specialem lexicon', a snapping Bookend,
	a Dark Prognosticus reproduction, and an emerald green book on
	Magikoopa rites in authentic Darklandian. They were lined up like-
	evidence!</font></p>

	steadily from rain, leading to the entrance of a tall tower, rising

	reach her but with Toadsworth over his sore shoulders, by the time
	he&rsquo;d gotten there she was already scraping herself back up. </font>

	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Without
	the doctor who held Dr. Mario&rsquo;s case study, there was little
	to do but roll in a Mushroom Flu patient one by one, look them up
	and down and return them where they came from in the same condition.
	For the Special World Hospital doctors, that was perhaps the closest
	they&rsquo;d been to &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; in ages. Locals began
	to murmur &lsquo;something something quack, pard&rsquo;ner&rsquo;,
	and a closely listening triage nurse suspected they weren&rsquo;t
	referring to the cataquack population. Jr. Troopa marched into the
	temporary tin shed lab, weaving and squeezing around the testbeds,
	tables with bubbling chemicals, and the hammer brother clacking at
	an old looking computer. Dr. Toad was found at the rearmost wall, at
	a clear spot he&rsquo;d carved out as his atelier. A six by four
	canvas hung at his eye level. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Jackson,
	I should recruit your blue toad nurse. I have never seen a more
	expedient associate who had yet only had the work experience of five
	minutes,&rdquo; Dr. Toad droned, etching Vick's homestead with a tan
	pastel. His right hand held the rubber band bound remainder of the
	set. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
	didn't used to be his style. &ldquo;Erm. These are enemy species
	parts, Drew. You're the only toad. Also folks starting to gossip
	bout.. Forget it. What he look like?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Tormented,
	weathered for his age, rivaling the intensity of a Pablo Pizzacaso
	portrait, a slight unibrow, almost always downward&hellip;But
	reasonably attractive, with muscles- large ones.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Before
	Troopa could react, there was a cacophony. He jumped around at
	people barging in and barring the door closed with a spade.
	&quot;Nevermind, there's a toad right there!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr.
	Toad's playful side evaporated as Dr. Toadley and his intern
	invaded, glistening from what part of their exposed skin didn't have
	dirt stuck to it. In panic Dr. Toad barreled past Troopa and Dr.
	Topper to cut them off halfway.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Stop!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Was
	my arrival unexpected? Yes it was! We hastened, even directly
	through villager's backyards and crops. Some had shotguns.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;An
	anonymous.. delivery person has given.. us a.. Mushroom Flu virus
	sample,&quot; the intern added in between breaths.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
	felt the ground swallow him. &quot;This was not a group effort,
	Houdini.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jr.
	Troopa came up modestly. &quot;Uh.. I can have the boys drag em out
	if it bothers you that much.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr.
	Toadley chuckled. &quot;We arrive to assist, not subjugate.&quot;
	But first to assert that he was no joke either, Toadley opened his
	palm to prove the impossible. The object within scintillate.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Behold!
	At 893:044; the courthouse of Grandmaster Galaxy emerges from
	interstellar clouds of dust and gas, stationed above pillars
	staggering higher in elevation: the first of emerald, the second
	chalcedony, the third sapphire, the fourth jasper, the fifth- </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The star
	warrior careened then into the sardonyx pillar of millennia,
	bouncing off like a Micro-Goomba against a Banzai Bill. Dizzyingly
	he identified that the obscuring fog was an organic material, eating
	it away. He bustled to the golden gate of the court, ajar with a
	holographic scroll attached: </font><em>&lsquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	Galaxy Courthouse is closed at this moment. Thanketh thee.'</font></em></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">(&#9825;&#9834;!?)
	reread in disbelief, as if he might bend the words with his will
	power to state something else. &ldquo;Drats.. only thirteen minutes
	late!&rdquo; His further acceleration released his passengers from
	the suspended state they were in during his lightspeed travels.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	and Toadsworth took a rough tumble against the glass plane the
	golden Greek style coliseum rested on. The koopaling had not fully
	regained his bearings when a threatening rumble from the vastness of
	space tore his attention from his bruises. Clumps of stars engaged
	in combat, some star warriors, others macabre seafoam colored stars,
	five pointed, flatter with sunken black eyes, the source of a wispy
	particle like material all but invisible unless if overlay a lighter
	colored planet or galaxy that revealed it as pure black and
	corrosive. It made dozens of star warriors sizzle to nothing- and
	the wicked forces were advancing!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	spun to take flight, colliding with Toadsworth. They split all over
	the place, that time into the interior. The koopaling was on his
	feet in seconds and sprinted blindly for miles down narrow twisting
	and turning halls of some light emitting yellow stone like material.
	Enigmatically, he met up with a familiar face who had obviously
	never moved. The gasp that escaped his lips was the koopaling&rsquo;s
	last breath as he collapsed from exhaustion. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">See
	what rash decisions just got you?&rdquo; Toadsworth strolled up to
	his snout. &ldquo;Tut tut. The rules of our old reality don&rsquo;t
	apply. Preceding forward we must locate our guardian and get the
	gist of things in an </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">orderly</font></em>
	<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">way.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A low
	growl emitted from the back of the koopaling&rsquo;s throat as he
	peeled his face from the floor. &ldquo;And why would someone of my
	caliber be frazzled, Samuel??&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	was not meddling,&rdquo; the elder replied, leading off in a random
	direction to Ludwig. &ldquo;After all, I cannot fathom how it feels
	to be snuffed out so young.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	Koopaling growled once more. That geriatric little.. And the emotion
	settled into his stomach, exhuming a poignant memory from six years
	ago: the arrival of the final sibling and the rapid sickness and
	death of their mother following. How Junior is given that very
	unique name and heired successor unprecedentedly. Ludwig slowly
	approached his father post funeral, the second that red cloaked
	stranger detached from his side, pleading for some explanation. He
	was more than old enough. He deserved it. As Bowser broke apart into
	wheezes and sniffles, he never got it. That was the impetus making
	the Koopa Troop his full time job, even over musical education. If
	he was militant enough, had grandiose enough strategies, had outside
	villain organizations recognize his efforts- could that make his
	father view him as worthy to govern his kingdom some day?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Apparently
	not. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig.
	Yo, your feet are making sparks. Pick it up!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	was roused to (&#9825;&#9834;!?) securing him and Toadsworth by the
	wrist into a radiant open courtroom. Hamstrung, Ludwig plopped down
	in the stands, unnoticed by Toadsworth surveying with the star
	warrior for the missing goddess. Rows of vacant seating scaled as
	high as Toadsworth could crane his neck. The war had yet to tarnish
	the upper echelons of the transparent roof. He could still see
	twinkling distant stars through them, too far to wish to. The devout
	man reached inwards instead..</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	do hope this does not offend sir,&rdquo; he ventured. &ldquo;But
	have you attempted to call her?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The star
	warrior bent upwards from the judge's podium, slapping himself.
	&ldquo;..Call me Geno and duh! We just got &lsquo;em. Cut me a
	break.&rdquo; He dialed a number on a brand new looking iPhone X.
	&ldquo;Hey girl&hellip;Oh! Right on..&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Geno
	readdressed the two, pausing only a moment at the koopaling&rsquo;s
	zonked out disposition. &ldquo;Hold still and, voila!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After a
	flash of light, the three were on a patch of grass on one of the
	islands that branched off from a central hi tech observatory
	structure with a reactor powering it. Other paths lead to living
	areas, buildings, and even schools from which lumas placidly carried
	on normal business. The sector of space here was dark blue, and
	eclectic galaxies were plainly visible in the distance. From Luigi&rsquo;s
	photos, Toadsworth registered it as the Comet Observatory, and here
	was its owner, strolling up from the center console and fumbling on
	an identical to Geno&rsquo;s phone in a way he might back on Earth,
	the elder toad was reminded ticklishly. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	intended to inform you of the new arrangements when the battles
	broke out over there (&#9825;&#9834;!?) , but could not locate the
	contacts app,&rdquo; the goddess admitted sheepishly. She tucked the
	rose gold iPhone away, giving up. She was like a living jewel before
	them, statuesque and aglow in mature beauty and grace, from her long
	platinum hair to her flawless skin, to the dazzlingly vibrant blue
	gown that extended to the floor. Despite that she sounded ordinary,
	dignified, but as any other shyish woman.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey
	no biggie Rosie. I only remembered your digits cause I wrote in on
	my bicep the other day! Where&rsquo;s the others?&rdquo; Geno gave a
	worrying sweep of the area.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Millennium
	Star insisted on imperiling himself without specifics.&rdquo; The
	goddess explained in a hush so as to not alert lumas in proximity.
	&ldquo;There was no one else.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Geno
	groaned, reluctantly turning to his guests. &ldquo;Alright, so us
	star beings WON&rsquo;T be rolling up on &lsquo;em gangsta style.
	Rosalina&rsquo;s Gravitational Pull will have to channel you to your
	bodies.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Good
	show!&rdquo; Toadsworth exclaimed. He pat Ludwig, who&rsquo;s
	eyebrows furrowed, unreadable otherwise.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-But
	there might be glitches. Could be distance, attenuation, we dunno.
	It&rsquo;s experimental, so do ya utmost to find the dark star&rsquo;s
	leader quickly and discreetly. It gets wind of us on the case and
	it&rsquo;ll switch from games to complete annihilation. We can&rsquo;t
	afford to swoop in and miss..&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadsworth
	burst with consternation. It was only through being so well bred
	that he didn&rsquo;t jump out and seize the star warrior going,
	&ldquo;What are you mad???&rdquo; Outwardly he steely accepted like
	he was a Mushroom soldier once more, agreeing to one of the serious
	missions whose success endeared him to the Toadstool dynasty. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Coolio.
	And we&rsquo;ll watch from here..?&rdquo; Geno gave a side glance to
	Rosalina. &ldquo;Oh one more thing. A good start might be to watch
	out for &lsquo;Special Objects&rsquo;. The Dark Star had to be
	connected to one and anybody using it. It takes arcane knowledge to
	discern which are connected to good or bad stars so just don&rsquo;t
	mess with them. ..Wait a second thing actually, don&rsquo;t tell
	other people what you&rsquo;re doing because if they&rsquo;re
	connected to an &lsquo;evil&rsquo; Special Object they might like,
	try to kill you and we can&rsquo;t exactly prevent that! ..Alright,
	anything to add, Rosie?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	goddess shuddered. She&rsquo;d spent most of that time with her
	sapphire eyes trained on the koopaling. She paced over with a
	message just for him and leaned beyond his wild blue hair.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
	not too late. Remember you are someone&rsquo;s &lsquo;Special One.&rsquo;&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><br/>
&hellip;<br/>
&hellip;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	sensation of choking woke Ludwig up- for real this time. The general
	coughed up murky tongue stinging water. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">How
	can BOTH of them pass out like that?! I hate everything!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry!&rdquo;
	Princess Peach rebuked. &ldquo;Stop fussing. We made it to the level
	we needed!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
	hauled Toadsworth and Ludwig into the center of the tower. There was
	a shaft with a manual powered elevator waiting for them. Just in
	time. They could hear the foaming waters sloshing on the floor
	below, even up creeping from the stairs. They hurried inside and
	spotted Lemmy far at the top. His rainbow mohawk disappeared and
	then they were shot up like a rocket, so much the basket broke at
	the top of the shaft, flinging everyone out onto the roof.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Whoops&hellip;&rdquo;
	Lemmy saw his brother continually spinning the winch. &ldquo;Iggy,
	you can stop!..&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
	rubbed his head, knocked against the parapet. &ldquo;Ouch. Thanks I
	freakin&rsquo; think..&rdquo; The flooded over landscape below sent
	a shiver down his spine. The waters were high enough to obscure the
	pillar thing in the field Peach was mesmerized by before. An airship
	sailed over the horizon, followed by additional smaller boats or
	whatever possessed buoyancy. Spontaneously a pontoon broke off from
	the others and raced up to the front ship. It had a hand weaved flag
	waving from it. A passenger from the lead ship plunged into the
	ocean.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What&rsquo;s
	Wendy thinking??&rdquo; Lemmy said, materializing next to his little
	brother. &ldquo;And I can&rsquo;t place where I&rsquo;ve seen that
	symbol before..&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
	couldn&rsquo;t cross his eyes enough to see whatever Lem could
	somehow. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t Iggster have service? Boogle it.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
	cringed, avoiding eye contact, digging his foot on the stone tile..
	&ldquo;Iggy IS Boogle now. Kinda. He got impatient and replaced his
	brain with a robot.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
	took another look around. Peach was okay if disarranged, Toadsworth
	and Ludwig.. They were moving, but morbid or &lsquo;off&rsquo; in a
	way he couldn&rsquo;t articulate right then. What overshadowed that
	even was.. Iggy was a cyborg!</font></p>

	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
	lounging toad girl observed traffic from Hotel Mario&rsquo;s tallest
	balcony. Sometimes a citizen would race down Starman Lane on foot,
	like in times past she could faintly remember. Before motor karts
	were the norm in Toad Town, everyone accordingly had less on the
	agenda and time in general felt slower. Toadette wished, just for
	today, she was shot back to those days.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	lowered the magazine after floorboards creaked. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What&rsquo;s
	up?&rdquo; signed another more tanned pink toad, with inverted spots
	compared to her. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
	plastered on a smile for the gardener. &ldquo;Just coolin off.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Joseph
	sat gingerly in the beach chair next to her. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in
	direct sunlight!&rdquo; He laughed with a hoarse husky voice.
	&ldquo;There&rsquo;s air conditioning indoors where we&rsquo;re all
	waiting for you. We leave in ten minutes. It&rsquo;s at four pm..&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
	I haven&rsquo;t done my hair yet! So many are already at Royal
	Raceway and there&rsquo;s..&rdquo; Dang it. She forgot the sign
	language for &lsquo;too many cameras and news people&rsquo; at the
	worst time!</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
	look beautiful, darling.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thanks
	but I can&rsquo;t go-&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Joe
	conveniently feigned ignorance of her verbalization, taking her hand
	and lifting her out of the seat. Toadette didn&rsquo;t want to
	behave rudely, indecision that roped her to the ground floor
	reception desk. She had to admit it being lit orange from the
	evening sun was an improvement, hiding the dinginess of the carpet
	and making the game machines look cool, but she wasn&rsquo;t happy
	to be there regardless, not with three more co-workers hanging
	around. She dread how they might try to cajole her.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Les
	yawned, back against the wall, Chef Tim chat on the phone off to the
	side with a pan in his other hand, and Zeror, made up spiffily and
	directly blocking the door, held a loupe to a yellow packet that had
	been ripped open and was currently a back board for a document. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Waitaminute.
	Toadette squinted, closing on the green capped banker and treasure
	curator none the wiser. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s addressed to the
	manager only, why haven&rsquo;t I seen it?&rdquo; When she tried to
	take it from him, there was resistance on his end from his trance
	like state that tore it across a preexisting seam middle line. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ma&rsquo;am
	oh heavens I've ruined it!!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hearing
	Zeror's light voice for once was as surprising as the weathered hand
	written document in an antiquated Shroomish dialect. The official
	mushroom seal adorned the bottom from their castle, Mushroom King
	reign era. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What&rsquo;s
	it say, doll?&rdquo; Les asked enthusiastically. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well
	Toadette&rsquo;s interest was piqued knowing legalese from collage,
	enough to forget that Zeror should have deciphered the list of items
	and herbs forever ago. &ldquo;What sticks out to me is &rsquo;Teeowed&rsquo;
	and a verb for &lsquo;consume&rsquo; and &lsquo;mushroom&rsquo;...So
	like we left behind this recipe thing and somebody found it for us?
	So what?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zeror&rsquo;s
	crafty simper to Les and Joe revealed his gold teeth. Toadette
	gulped, rolling up her half of the paper. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
	else of the princess&rsquo;s priceless possessions might we have
	missed?&rdquo; Joe asked.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Uh,
	Joseph, Lester, even Mr. Zeror, there&rsquo;s no way we can recomb
	the area. Not with that event going on,&rdquo; she rebutted. There
	was something very strange and over elaborate with this trap they&rsquo;d
	set, but she wasn&rsquo;t falling for it. They hadn&rsquo;t even
	tried her true weakness-</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
	Tim,&rdquo; Les began. &ldquo;Show her the Chocolate Cake!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The chef
	removed the cover from the pan, a fresh Jelly Ultra. Toadette could
	thankfully refuse, temptation free. She disliked the jelly
	derivatives. Too sticky, much like the situation was getting.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">If
	only that guy would listen!&rdquo; Joe complained to Les and Zeror.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Excuse
	me flower boy,&rdquo; Tim snapped. &ldquo;Face me so I can see what
	you're saying!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	said this, Timothy,&rdquo; after signing the chef&rsquo;s name, Joe
	swung at him. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	rotund chef slipped backward and through the entrance door and
	rolled to a stop at a parking brick outside. He propelled himself up
	as the other three staff barged out brandishing a fire extinguisher,
	a vase, or surprisingly nothing as far as Zeror was concerned. The
	chef exposed from under his apron a long silver butcher's knife and
	held them off with it. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You're
	all on drugs!!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Stoooooop!&rdquo;
	Toadette ran out between him. &ldquo;All this just because I don&rsquo;t
	want to go down there??&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They were
	all daunted, Joe broadly.. &ldquo;You are the foremost of the
	princess&rsquo;s subsidiaries and we cannot attend without you. What
	if officials organize a plan to rescue the princess?&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Not
	likely according to flyers, Toadette mused, in uncharted waters.
	Weird phrasing, Toad Town hadn&rsquo;t had rain in weeks, also- not
	a homicide since fifteen years ago if the baddie influx yesterday
	didn&rsquo;t count, yet Peach&rsquo;s staff were prepared to hurt
	each other. What was happening to people?</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
	are you thinking?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	blinked. &ldquo;That&hellip;You are now castle manager. There, now
	you can all attend.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Another
	first, she saw Zeror&rsquo;s bottom lip under his bushy mustache
	while he gaped. &ldquo;How am I qualified, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
	were Mr. Toadsworth&rsquo;s friend, has decades of history with the
	Toadstools, and you didn&rsquo;t pack a weapon just now. Done. Oh
	look,&rdquo; she added, under the other three&rsquo;s
	disappointments of the missed promotion. A dark tented van was
	pulling up. &ldquo;Totally just in time.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Guard Jon
	didn&rsquo;t bother with a tally of toads for Peach Castle. It only
	surprised Toadette that he did not bring along his partner. Bridget
	paced at the hotel slot machines, fidgeting constantly with the
	intricacies of her uniform or giggling at her reflections. Toadette
	wasn&rsquo;t sure what drove her desire to formally introduce
	herself. Toadettes were rarer and she was lonely now, and the irony
	wasn&rsquo;t lost on her that after pining for promotion she&rsquo;d
	just demoted herself. There was nothing to lose. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hi.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bridget
	stood straight on high alert, super scope on hand. She was a tad
	shorter, with entirely different and darker features and sportier, a
	tough one. Maybe this was a bad idea..</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Uh,
	nothing..&rdquo; Toadette bit her lip, backing away.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wait.
	So you&rsquo;re, haha, good with the city, eh?</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">..Sure.
	I chauffeur the princess sometimes.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	guard&rsquo;s smile widened. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sooo jealous! Since
	that dick Jon is gone will you ride with me on some errands?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Moments
	later Toadette sqeed. Around back was a shiny B-Dasher, a privately
	owned kart used for the job, Mushroom insignias juxtaposed on it,
	and still gorgeous. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Don&rsquo;t
	drool on my seat covers,&rdquo; Bridget joshed, nudging the enamored
	ex-manager.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Toadette blushed. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The guard
	loaded in the back some boxed army supplies that looked suspiciously
	like junk food while Toadette loaded a heavier larger neutral
	colored purse full of many objects and that Ultra Jelly. They drove
	off in the convertible, loving the breeze. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	have a ton of friends stationed around.. Pleasant Path. Know there?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sure
	do!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Doesn&rsquo;t
	a pocketbook like that break your back?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
	readjusted her seat belt. &ldquo;You get used to it.. Now take that
	right down Turtlely Road,&rdquo; she said to switch the topic. Those
	items were what she thought was the most valuable of Zeror&rsquo;s
	treasure stash, no longer trusting entirely any staff but her
	boyfriend, though even he freaked her out by ominously texting if
	she could bring some of Zoo&rsquo;s evidence from Snifit Patrol
	precinct down South. How did he know that&rsquo;s where she needed
	to get to as well? The cops more pertinently were holding Peach&rsquo;s
	Parcel from yesterday which would surely demystify much of the
	commotion in town..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">For step
	one, Toadette grabbed a well worn cassette from her pocket. This
	other girl was about to love the mushroom rock band &lsquo;The
	Pizza&rsquo;s&rsquo; whether she knew it or not. They&rsquo;d gotten
	heat over it in later years, but none could deny they were the
	masters of subliminal messages.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	wiggled his toes that had fallen asleep in his boots. He was
	genuinely intrigued at the outset. Too bad the pile of books on the
	wooden counter proved to be insipid at best, even with that bright
	warning tag on them stating 'DO NOT REMOVE FROM LIBRARY'. Mario
	dismissed the nagging detail. Considering they were in the local
	librarian's trailer home while they were out on business, The
	Captain must have obtained permission.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Stuck?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Um.
	Yes,&quot; The Captain replied, voice leaking with embarrassment. He
	massaged his strained eyes. On the page characters went backwards
	and forwards at random, and at times 'stylistically' spiraling to
	the center of the page. His attempt to read it was such a
	trainwreck, Luigi felt uncomfortable, left, and never came back.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	without prompt, had a device in his hands. &quot;Break time. Jr.
	Troopa's blowing me up about something at the lab just now.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	Captain bore into the brick-like GoomPCS, a rudimentary model for
	species with no appendages. He'd mistook it for someone else's, but
	the next correct realization was equally worrisome. &quot;You've
	acquired a new cellular phone, and distributed your new number, and
	didn't inform me?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	mildly bewildered plumber slid it back into his pocket. &quot;It
	wasn't that long ago. It's just a cheap thing from the drugstore
	that I used a prepaid card on. Not a big deal okay?-..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;...I'll
	meet you there. Sir.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	moment the plumber was out, he flipped the entire table of books
	with a roar of anguish, making them fly up and into cupboards and
	knickknacks. That beast had been simmering since Luigi left
	practically LAUGHING in his face- now that humiliation in front of
	Mario? The Captain trembled and hyperventilated. If only he could
	cram enough knowledge to interpret the Darklandian in the magikoopa
	book&hellip; The red faded from his vision enough to notice
	something shiny on the floor, retrieving a silver-plated locket. Not
	very valuable he appraised with proficiency, nonetheless someone
	might want to see it.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	waltzed into the previously shut up disarrayed bedroom and opened a
	chest under tangled covers. The bob-omb buddy bound tightly inside
	mumbled through the pillowcase stuffed in his mouth and squirmed at
	the toad's cheeky face as he loomed over. A bad smell struck his
	nose from the fear-stricken victim. Miffed with him, The Captain
	plunked the heirloom down there and shut the trunk tight again. He
	wasn't planning on returning. It would be wise at this point to ask
	his brigade down. He had a way to insure it actually.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	played fetch with Poochy, occasionally waving to neighbors, or being
	forced to rescue them as the Dino Rhino and Ukiki couple that owned
	the berry farm down the jungle path discovered. Poochy was growing
	and inclined to play rough with things or people with certain
	scents. A quirk of the breed, but Yoshi was managing it- more or
	less rather.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	rallied over the dog to escape the elements for a while. Tall sumac
	buffeted him along the way. He'd meant to tame the land around his
	treehouse more. It was covering the 'For sale' sign..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	later collapsed on his striped hammock, watching nostalgically at
	the little leaf spinning fan. He had a dresser to the right, an
	icebox and nothing else that wasn't packed in boxes. The rest of the
	space was racks of trendy clothing and additional boxes. Even before
	plans to emigrate the dino tread light for less complications when
	crossing between Yoshi's Island and the Mushroom Kingdom. At this
	point he could pass as a Mushroomite by accent.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His
	IslandMobile ringing frightened him. He was in the midst of such a..
	delicate situation involving telecommunication.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yoshi.
	Still alive? Luigi wanted to thank you for the help yesterday.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi sat
	up from the hammock, feeling like a thwomp hit him. That deplorable
	work of his in the park against Zoo? Not listening, behaving like a
	rookie.. What did Luigi see in that? Well, he'd make up for it
	double.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Mario,
	you want me over now. Right???&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Uh.
	Better hear what happened since from me than the news.&quot; He told
	him, never interrupted once, which made Mario uneasy.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Great.
	I'll get over there however it takes. Train, boat, plane. -And I
	hate flying but I'll do it!&quot; The dino was already pacing
	around, causing Poochy to drop a plush chew toy and watch.<br/>
&quot;Didn't
	you hear me? You said you were about to get married didn't you?
	Maybe move further inland? Always talking about how your buddies on
	Dino island started families forever ago? With grandchildren now?
	Don't get yourself killed.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He froze.
	&quot;What.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I'm
	giving you at ticket to normalcy Yosh. Hold on.&quot; Mario seemed
	to move somewhere, probably secluded. &quot;I wanted to tell you
	this long ago. Your old lady is sick of you crossing over all the
	time. We both know that.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	dinosaur plopped back down. &quot;Mario I.. Yes, but no matter what
	I do, short of 'nothing', Birdo has an issue. I keep her informed
	every literal hour I'm out. I'm with her if I'm not with you, and of
	course she's not somewhere, where ever that is these days. I'm
	mystified.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No
	you're not.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	sighed, glancing over his home emptily. &quot;Of course. I'm not.
	Either I'll surprise you later, or you can surprise me with how it
	went down in a day or two. Good bye..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	surprised himself by resisting the urge to move, all the way until
	he heard the squeaks of the ladder outside. Someone was returning to
	the tree home. He stood then and had the door already open for his
	fianc&eacute;e, dolled up in a hot pink dress coat and matching
	church hat. Slightly taken back by his initiative, she blew a kiss
	at him and continued in, placing the Bronze Egg on the mantelpiece.
	Poochy aggressively snarled at it like he always did. Yoshi rolled
	his eyes a little, securing the locks. She was supposed to hide that
	'prop' from 'Authentic Restorations Inc.' knowing it triggered the
	pet like that. Disposing of it wasn't going to fly either, not
	without a fight. His fianc&eacute;e was enraptured with that tacky
	thing, insisting the modeling agencies booked her two-fold with it.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Honey,
	get comfortable please,&rdquo; he led off, remaining standing. He
	watched her casually lounge on her red love sofa without alarm,
	already flicking around on her smartphone. He took one more breath.
	&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about that location you want us to move to.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	snapped in his direction. &ldquo;T. Yoshisaur, half the treehouse is
	in a box!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Indeed,
	but we haven&rsquo;t deposited yet on that Donut Plains condo and I
	would like to, if I can, present my argument differently: Prices are
	up and this land is paid for. If we aren&rsquo;t going to worry
	about money, the Mushroom Kingdom would be a more appropriate fit
	for us. All of your highest paying agencies are based there and I&rsquo;ve
	seen some of the letters where they ask for you to move closer. With
	our rapport we&rsquo;d have zero issues finding a home. Just
	something to consider. Just trying to make you happy.&rdquo; He
	lifted his gaze from his orange booties across the carpet and onto
	her longing expression at...the Bronze Egg!! A flash of anger came
	upon him. He&rsquo;d tried so arduous, for that? He knew what she
	loved and it wasn&rsquo;t him. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	launched it through the window. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">YOSHI!!&rdquo;
	she exploded. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	thought she might follow it, but remained at the window seal. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-That
	was uncalled for and I'll rectify that.&quot; Yoshi slowly
	approached her side. The sun made three objects glint among the
	ragweed and sumac, including the cracked egg. &quot;However, I have
	no better way to say this.. Birdo, there's a dagger in me and I've
	bled for a long time. Going forward it would be wise for us to take
	a break. Our lifestyles aren't compatible.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Birdo
	slowly faced him. He almost recoiled, not sure what to expect. &quot;I
	agree and- Whew! There's too much chaos in these parts. I really
	wanted to move back to Subcon anyway,&quot; she mentioned about as
	casually as one would the weather.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	thought Mario and crew..dreamed up.. Nevermind. Will you need help?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No.
	I'll hire movers. Old man,&quot; she teased. &quot;And since you've
	ended it officially, I won't be dragged on social media.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Who
	gives unsolicited commentary on other people's romantic life
	online?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	thought you were adept with technology.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Sarcasm
	honey.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
	laughed together, softly rather. Realization of the Abilene paradox
	was bittersweet at best for both of them.</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	rhythmic shuffling of tracks meant there was a slumbering dinosaur
	for a multicolored dog to lick in the face, having escaped from a
	partially sized luggage bag thirty minutes ago. Soon his master
	mumbled about that person again.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Poochy
	was a good boy.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He was
	learning phrases.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	understood 'stop', 'go', 'fetch', and 'Here's money for a shopping
	spree, honey'.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He also
	purported what 'Mario' meant.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That name
	seemed to connect with elation in general for Master.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Therefore&hellip;
	Mario must be food. See? Poochy smart boy.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A loud
	steam whistle jolted Yoshi awake. He flushed at the canine nuzzling
	him. &quot;No boy. Get back in quick. Quick!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Another
	yoshi, the ticket checker that had been pestering everyone in that
	section, and with a katana too, came up. &quot;I knew my allergies
	weren't lying, Larry. Found him.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;The
	Koopaling?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
	uniformed toad came up. &quot;No sir, I'm the conductor. The Toad
	Town 101 does not allow pets in the passenger compartments,&quot; he
	warned sternly. Then he presented a pen and pad for an autograph.
	&quot;But for the famous Mr. Munchakoopas, we'll pretend we didn't
	see it. We only request that you go to the rear most carriage if
	there's any 'accidents'.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That was
	a great deal as moments later, Poochy was indicating one of those
	were waiting to happen. That rear unmonitored room was a storage
	area for hay bails, the only source of light the sliding door
	precariously half open. Trees and jungle scrolled by in a jade blur
	outside. As Poochy sniffed around, Yoshi had last minute
	reservations. What if those belonged to someone? He chose to not
	think about it too hard, looking away for the dog's privacy at the
	adjacent wall with an Emerald Circus poster. One of Bowser's sons
	were on the bill. Oh yeah.. He'd seen Lemmy perform by accident
	about a year ago. He bounced around the stage like he had a blast.
	Adorable thing.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	prefer the Cirque du Angry Solei.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His jaw
	dropped at the one next to him. &quot;How did you get here?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Teleportation.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Be
	serious or-&quot; Yoshi grit his teeth. &quot;Just forget it, Dr.
	Professor.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Doctor
	Professor Koopa smiled at him, continuing to hold his shoulder.
	Stubble spotted the corners of his face, but was otherwise just as
	Friday. &quot;I'm not at my practice obviously so you may address me
	Theo.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;How
	about not.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;That's
	really my name.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Look,
	what happened to your havok wreaking crew?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He didn't
	seem particularly concerned. &quot;I suppose apprehended while we
	were fleeing town.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
	are aware we're heading back to Toad Town.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
	are. I'm not.&quot; Dr. Prof checked his cracked watch and with a
	burst of energy threw himself into another train passing the
	opposite direction. Yoshi made a lightning decision, scooped his dog
	up and did the same. They landed in a pile of red clay. This train
	was rickety and vibrated like an earthquake compared to the last.
	Worse, he feared he was already lost. With no covering over each car
	he could see water on either side and the bridge ahead stretching
	into the unknown. He pressed on. The dino carefully made his way
	over the coupler and into the next car, rewarded with satisfaction
	from that criminal's dumb stare from atop the gravel pile.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Surprise,
	Theodore.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;...You
	have a tenacity most don't at our age, boy! Mario for a certainty
	sent you to hunt me down and stomp my face. I propose an information
	exchange?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The dino
	nodded at the willingness to bargain. He might have also been, just
	a tiny bit, pumped up by that complement. &quot;Fair.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;When
	my 'Sweet Pea' was a grammar school age I was the castle medic. One
	day her father and one of his high ranking red toads, can't remember
	the name but it's unoriginal, flipped out on me over a scientific
	theory that toads and humans favoring is more than a mere
	coincidence.... So I followed where there was a need, at a rapidly
	flourishing Castle Koopa. Great gig until Mushroom Flu broke out.
	You must understand that, while we refer to is as a 'virus' it is
	abstruse, from a mushroom that does not grow on Earth. Yes, those
	bastards sent it as an intentional attack from their evil stars. Dr.
	Mario confirmed it.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	blinked at him. &quot;What are you saying??&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	wrinkles around Dr. Prof. Koopa's eyes creased. &quot;That was my
	end of the bargain. Now please enlighten me on.. the touch of a
	human. -Oh my apologies. You never found out with him.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Him?!
	I.. w-who??&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Mario.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi had
	another bout of.. &quot;That's not how 'that' works. What are you
	trying to leverage against me?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Ah
	ah ah.&quot; The doctor wagged a finger. &quot;If I went there,
	you'd react poorly-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	found his hands crushing the doctor's throat, demonstrating in real
	time. He shoved the koopa back against the sloped wall of the cart,
	shifting around and half burying both in gravel and powder. It shook
	the dinosaur out of it, stepping back, in fact wanting to be as far
	from the giggling, wheezing fiend as possible.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;The
	cops will deal with you!&quot; He whistled for Poochy and flung
	himself off board and into the blue ocean waters.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A belated
	realization rippled through him that he was in the middle of
	nowhere, the suspension bridge his only aid. He counted concrete
	pillars as some way to track progress. His arms burned by number
	thirty, where a whirlpool began to pulling him. Poochy immediately
	left his saddle and swam away, disappearing over a rolling wave. The
	dinosaur accepted his fate then with equanimity. The canine was only
	preserving his life.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The water
	broke, and he refocused on the fluorescent orange object, a life
	preserver. For him! He encouraged his companion with the ring in his
	teeth until he could grab on. Some rope tethered to it swiftly towed
	them towards a white fishing boat so miniature, the billows obscured
	it easily. The toad reeling them in lauded at the bonus extra soul
	saved.</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No
	problem. That's why I pretend to be a- I mean I AM definitely a
	coast guard. Need another towel?&quot; Sonny, as he introduced
	himself, asked his passengers. He was a youngish red toad wearing
	all black, with a tactical vest as large as him.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No.
	Thank you again.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Good.
	That was, um, my only one.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	wrapped the dog with it at the moment, being the furry creature of
	the two. Yoshis were resilient anyway and he didn't want Poochy
	getting another sinus infection. Yoshi and the coast guard chat
	readily for a bit, neither prying. Soon Sonny mentioned they were
	near Pipe Land. He reduced speed to not beach on any underground
	pipes, in the process acutely spotting something bobbing around. The
	coast guard released a ragged sigh as he reeled it in. Yoshi soon
	understood. It was a decaying baddie. Sonny had a different
	procedure for that one and it soon was respectfully stored away in a
	large tackle box.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Life was
	too fragile to leave loose ends. Yoshi thought back to the Bronze
	Egg pieces he'd packed with him. It was petty to take that. Best he
	repair or replace, and mail it back to her. Just as a way to say
	maturely, 'sorry it didn't work out, but here'.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Really?&quot;
	Boo eyed the heavy gift in the black carrying case.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yeah,
	lil fella. The owner of this kart doesn't deserve cool toys like
	that. Display only now. For safety.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	Koopa was the type to make them comfortable with, well, people.
	Giving them the shiny ray gun found under the seat was a little
	jarring, and Boo had zero experience or want in such, but the
	implications filled them with joy. They were considered grown up,
	capable, cool, trustworthy. Attributes Luigi might like&hellip;
	Further demonstrated when Kylie made a detour for Boo to deliver
	&lsquo;S.G.&rsquo;s other delivery to the Toadley Clinic.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Pulling
	into the lot of Mushroom Kingdom Hospital East, the boo found some
	fringes of their old diffident mood returning. Scattered around were
	karts like the guards drove. Boo braved following Kylie inside. The
	species diverse staff from yesterday were replaced with unfamiliar
	toads either at a desk or seated leisurely in the lobby with reading
	material. While in civilian clothing mostly, their black spots
	hinted otherwise. Boo reached the end of a hallway and noticed Kylie
	was missing. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie,
	finally you show up!!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Smack in
	the middle of the previous hall, the koopa reporter blanketed the
	toad with a hug. He winced, making her ease up. He was bloated, felt
	quite warm, and was dressed in the same suit he had the last time
	she&rsquo;d seen him, now with dark stains blotting it. His lap was
	filled with old facial tissues stained identically. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mitch,
	what are ya doing here? Does this name ring a bell? Jelectro Bond.
	He called himself your-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sign
	this first babe. I never took you off my power of attorney. It&rsquo;s
	good.&rdquo; Mitch jut a clipboard at her. He never did that, not
	even in the office when he was supposed to hand her things at times.
	Furthermore these sorts of &lsquo;life matters&rsquo; were arranged
	back when they still dated decades ago!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	read over the document in faded hard to read transfer paper ink. He
	could not be presently released due to- Her eyes widened.
	&ldquo;Irregularities in frontal cortex.&rdquo; That explained his
	slurred words, some strabismus.. &ldquo;Mitch. You&rsquo;re busted
	up. What happened to you?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	wheeled away, sluggishly, weakly. &ldquo;Just sign it, hurry.. I
	need to get outta here. Lay down. In my bed. Don&rsquo;t worry. The
	docs don&rsquo;t understand my nose bleed problem is normal-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mitch-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">For
	the love of God, please sign the thing!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Was
	the second floor colder, or was it just her? The reporter remained
	unnerved proceeding towards Kinopio-Kun&rsquo;s room. She had to
	remind herself, repeatedly, that her co-worker had to deal with his
	own problems. Had he ticked off someone again? Had a hit on him? She
	could only speculate as two piantas in black suits left the room
	before she entered. Weird. She slipped in. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo
	wasn&rsquo;t waiting inside. Uh oh.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The lime
	green toad was up and awake in his bed with a laptop. A table to his
	left held Starmanbucks coffee cups, and a stack of sympathy cards.
	High end personal luggage occupied the guest recliners. Beady eyes
	rose from the bright screen.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-
	Oh Hey. It&rsquo;s Kylie Koopa, ace reporter. I love your work,&quot;
	she fibbed. &quot;Now as ya know there's an event today and-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He waved
	&lsquo;go on&rsquo; impatiently. Kylie&rsquo;s smile tightened.
	Little twerp. &ldquo;-In short. Could ya give the word to the
	&lsquo;authorities&rsquo; that I really wanna be there and won&rsquo;t
	cause any trouble?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His jaw
	shifted from side to side, thinking it over she guessed. Seemed like
	an inopportune time for other burning questions, such as why he&rsquo;d
	dragged Mario through the wringer this morning with his postings.. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	flashed a symbol, and not the one she expected.</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Deja vu.
	Boo had gotten lost again, finding their way into the cafeteria. The
	air was heavy of various foods and up ahead at the tables staff
	tidied up, discouraging Boo from bothering them. With their head
	down and rosey cheeks, Boo whipped around.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Where&rsquo;s
	the packet?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo froze
	in the caf&eacute; doorway, quivering at S.G.&rsquo;s voice from
	nowhere. &ldquo;I- I.. delivered it s-sir..&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There was
	a sound like someone banging their head against a desk. &ldquo;You
	were supposed to deliver the soda can, but get the paper translated
	and returned,&rdquo; he hissed. &ldquo;Ahhhg&hellip;What it
	contained *could* have blown away everyone at the Public Address!!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Noooooo,&rdquo;
	they groveled. &ldquo;I can get it back. I have a helper, and a ride
	and I won&rsquo;t screw up again!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
	zoomed to the lobby, not locating Kylie. Boo went to the help desk,
	in line behind the belligerent, wildly gesticulating X-naut Phd. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Because
	computers are untrustworthy paraphernalia compared to this!&rdquo;
	The stout alien in white doctor coat and thick glasses, shook around
	a pink sticky note from his black tattered medical bag. It stated:
	&lsquo;Get out of bed and help us out today at the hospital,
	associate!!!! -Dr. Toad&rsquo;. &ldquo;See? I am supposed to be
	here. Check for the seventeenth time. Morris has two Rs you see,
	like the original spelling of R.O.B before the underground robot
	league visited him and rewrote all the books.&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	irritated receptionist flipped a &lsquo;temporarily out of service&rsquo;
	sign up and closed the shutter over the glass. Boo was backing away
	when the doctor sniffed the air, impressively through the scarf
	around his lower face. He spun, giddily, &ldquo;You there. Stop. I
	beckon you. You won&rsquo;t regret it.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo
	almost choked on their own spit. Everyone could sense they were
	weirdos anyway, and gave them space outdoors. &ldquo;I promise I'm
	not who you think-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Cut
	it out. Now, yoink, as the kids say!&quot; He plucked a tiny
	tracking device from behind the boo's invisible ear, further
	exaggerating their stupefied look. &quot;Mr. Charles or Spy Guy is a
	crafty scoundrel for this, recruiting the uninitiated so that I
	cannot snuff him out upon my arrival in town. Until they learn to
	hide the red blinking lights, Super Spy HQ will continue to be one
	of five million secret organizations I know of and will document one
	day with a best seller to shut up those naysayers,&quot; he
	explained importantly, simultaneously revealing an out of date
	atlas. &quot;Oh, and are there any alternative hospitals in the
	area?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo
	hesitantly pointed down South.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Splendid.
	Hahaha.&quot; He rubbed his mittens together rapidly.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;..But
	who are you?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Professor
	Morris Cosmo X-naut, Dr. Toad's best scientist. The fellow once told
	me my intelligence scares him.. or was it my resume? Anyway I own
	documents from Dr. Mario, essential for curing MF safely. Did I
	mention we're mad scientists at the Special World Hospital?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sweat
	rolled off Boo's forehead. Were they doing something wrong all
	along? It all seemed like too much then.. They were </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">split</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	burst out quicker than the automatic doors could open for her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
	in, woot woot!&ldquo; she cheered. &ldquo;Drop whatever ya doing
	cause we got permission. It&rsquo;s gonna be the biggest thing since
	the Star Festival. And yes if you come, you're gonna be popular!&rdquo;
	she sang. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Booigi
	the Second revolved to face her with a half smile. &quot;I know I
	will.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Saul Toad
	verified the order of his cheat cards one last time, then tucked
	them under his cuff. A roar was deafening outside the tent set up,
	emanating from onlookers at the bank. Any closer was prohibited and
	the prayer circles or whatever they were at the castle wreckage site
	were broken up so a PA system could be planted and some order
	restored. The orange capped toad in military uniform, official
	public speaker for the Mushroom King, had only flown down an hour
	ago and with a misbuttoned jacket. He was intent on making up for
	that graceless arrival. He&rsquo;d blow them away. When it was over,
	they&rsquo;d be speechless. Toad Town was only peasants and
	vagrants. Just imagine everyone at the lakefront in their underwear,
	worked every time! </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Heading
	up to the mic stands on the raised area of the lawn with the cannon,
	he was escorted by his choice of guard on each side. The local
	police offered previously, however he relegated those freaks to the
	sidelines. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;It's
	gonna be good,&rdquo; squeaked the left one. Their name escaped
	Saul, some average height toad of intermediate gender. That's the
	spirit. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The other
	more imposing one kept silent and hazily secured his right side.
	Saul would have delivered a lashing if not in full view of the crowd
	at that point. That was Benedict&rsquo;s thanks for being pardoned
	and not sent to the gallows?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Saul
	began with the pleasantries and credentials and then rolled right
	into it. &quot;&hellip; Pleased to declare, our King will rebuild
	his daughter's castle in all its splendor and beauty!&quot; He
	allowed applause to reside. &quot;-On a plot of land graciously
	bestowed from his estate in Poshley Heights!&hellip; Questions?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Intentional
	trick question, rather. Only the handful in the front could shout
	something intelligible, and most of them were &lsquo;citizens&rsquo;
	the Poshley guards planted. Lakitu raised his hand nervously. It was
	&lsquo;the&rsquo; Lakitu, of the Lakitu Bros with a film camera
	running and extensive history with Mario and co&rsquo;s sports. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hm.
	Interesting. It&rsquo;s just that the princess never expressed that
	desire.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Perhaps
	not to you. Why wouldn&rsquo;t she want her Castle closer to her
	father and in a &lsquo;safer&rsquo; nicer area?&rdquo; Some
	murmuring arose anew in the crowd, starting at the front and rolling
	back. About as expected. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A few
	more citizens expressed their views as a boo brought Kylie Koopa to
	the front. The ritzy reporter was nauseous from being phased through
	body after body, but the excitement of the destination helped her
	battle it. She prepared her DSLR. The backdrop was striking. Click
	click click. The jagged ruins of the castle.. Star Hill&rsquo;s
	purple elevations beyond that ..the aristocrats in their midst lined
	up all intimidating like.. Snifit Patrol wagging a finger at her
	from his silver car parked by the tree..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	lowered the camera and waved frivolously. Her eye wandered in the
	process to a semi-visible Boo crossing the prohibited tape. It must
	have been some residual power from before, as she noticed she was
	the only one who could see the boo go uphill and towards- They were
	NOT heading for pesky Snifit Patrol, but Saul in the middle of
	answering something from a Sarasaland roketon diplomat. Kylie
	watched in slow motion the boo solidify, reveal, and aim her gift,
	the ray gun, point blank at the King&rsquo;s representative. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Open.
	Your. Ears. This is what the millions the back who you refuse to

	audible to many with the surreal silence that draped over the
	audience, and crumbled into dozens of pieces containing his diced
	chunks. Some slipped down the hill and against the feet of the
	onlookers and others into the lake where they floated. </font>
