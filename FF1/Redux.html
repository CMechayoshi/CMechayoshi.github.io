	<p>Summary</p>
	<blockquote class="userstuff">As the adage goes, 'keep your friends
	close and your enemies closer'!<br/>
But.. What if, despite
	yourself, the enemy was too close? When the Mushroom Kingdom to Dark
	Land Peace Pact is insidiously broken, the stakes become so high
	that everyone's secrets, even those buried deepest must come out.</blockquote>
	<p>Notes</p>
	<blockquote class="userstuff">New stuff: Story complete.</blockquote>
	<blockquote class="userstuff">Old notes: This tale will eventually
	tackle situations that are fantastical but still retain real world
	allusions, for satire or played straight. Some chapters will contain
	individual content warnings. (Mostly once the story gets momentum,
	and typically regarding violence because I'm always unsure what
	people's tolerances are, but still.)</blockquote>
	<blockquote class="userstuff">The pre- 2022 work dates on the early
	chapters refer to a version of this story only my my website (see
	profile). They were the basis for those chapters thus the reference.

	<p><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoom!
	A mushroom powered racer takes the ramp. Thousands of feet up, their
	cart soars in the sky, creating a picture perfect sweep of their
	silhouette across the moon. Screech! The racer in eighth overshoots
	a tight curve. Sparks fly from the metal rails separating them from
	death. The racer directly behind, not so fortunate, is flung off the
	edge. On the opposite side of the track, the first place racer has
	their moment of peace shattered when the second placer relentlessly
	fires heat seeking red shells.~</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">
	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A Mario
	Kart kicked off the recreation weekend, for the uninitiated, a long
	running and profitable extravaganza the famous plumber hosted.
	Groups of heroes, villains, and everyone in-between had a chance to
	compete fiercely on streets, dirt tracks, underwater, through sand,
	snow, and whatever Cheese Land was supposed to be, to vouch for
	prizes. Recently among Mario and co, there'd been a lull in
	activity, so he wanted to set the mood by starting them on the
	infamous Rainbow Road. Fit for a Special Cup circuit, the track was
	a vivid and colorful ribbon-like band, perpetually suspended in the
	stratosphere. Only the occasional rail and Lakitu's diligence
	separated the racers from certain doom. For Mario frontrunning
	however, the soundtrack from hidden boomboxes was crystal clear,
	almost making the race leisurely- Not exactly what he was going for.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Finally
	I caught up with ya, moustache!&quot; Followed by the nagging alarm
	of red shells, that was more like it, the plumber thought.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Though
	those projectiles couldn't handle the tight twists of the
	anti-gravity section, King Bowser Koopa could. Mario watched from
	the mirrors his rival's red eyes boring into the back of his head,
	and how his claws were about to snap the steering wheel in half.
	Bowser's lean pipe frame kart was riddled with dents and scrapes
	marring the orange paint, no doubt from fighting his way up from his
	seventh starting position. Mario had to wonder if that was in
	response to him borrowing his neighbor's Bullet Blaster cart and
	being dumb enough to inform Bowser of that during a totally innocent
	phone conversation. In exchange for the bulk Bowser could terrify
	most racers with, sans Donkey Kong possibly, he could actually
	recover from obstacles and catch up, superbly in that moment, side
	by side with Mario and smirking.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You're
	slacking!&quot; he teased.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	rolled his eyes. His foot had fallen asleep is all, and- the
	shooting stars distracted him! ..Indeed that's why via his map, all
	those blips representing the rest of the crew were right on him.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;This'll
	wake you up.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After
	Bowser slapped a bob-omb in his face, Mario had to swerve for a
	trick ramp. Exhilarating as they were on a joy ride, time trial
	specializing racers resisted temptation for a reason. He landed a
	few microseconds behind, the bouncy rubber tires wasting more time
	before an item box section. Mario grumbled over the single banana.
	Thankfully Bowser was a combination of arrogant as always but
	narrower, driving right in-between the boxes. Ha, he laughed, now in
	the position where he saw Bowser eyeing him in the mirrors. Mario
	used some quick mini turbos as they traversed through a zero gravity
	loop, descended down a spiral, outwitted a blue shell twice, and
	crossed the finish line to start the final lap. Just as the music
	sped up-</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Woohoo!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">From
	golden mushrooms, Toad zoomed past Mario and Bowser's stunned faces,
	traveling far until he spun out on stray bananas. A green dinosaur,
	a remarkably fine racer to be the only participant that didn't grow
	up around karts, took a mushroom-less shortcut to insert himself in
	the top three slots. Mario and him made a pact to not abuse each
	other too much during games, but when his oldest and best friend had
	that sort of gleam in his eyes, he had to watch out regardless. He
	shot triple green shells to force Mario and Bowser to separate, but
	Yoshi wouldn't get further, someone barreling beyond him while
	encapsulated by a bullet-bill. With a smoky poof Bowser Junior
	emerged. Mario checked the map. That one item had propelled Junior
	from eleventh to third, leaving him sandwiched between Bowsers!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The red
	plumber audibly huffed through his nose. His only way out of this
	might be whoever that was on the radar, a thundercloud victim
	weaving around Koopa, who was typically a local jogger, Toadette of
	Peach castle, Luigi his brother, Donkey Kong a rare VIP guest, and
	Birdo all the way from across the globe, to hone in on.. him
	specifically?! Toad was nuts, or feigned it enough to make even his
	stomach sink a bit.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	spun out 360 degrees and bang against a fake music playing asteroid
	as his chaotic friend was zapped by the item, taking out Junior as
	collateral. After the red plumber recovered, boosting with the
	ejected mushroom on the road, he was in arms reach of Bowser and for
	a few moments, it was only them again.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Phew!&quot;
	Bowser went first, surprising him.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;What?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Good
	riddance. Those losers were stealing the spotlight when these events
	are all about us and OUR rivalry!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well..
	yes and no, Mario corrected inwardly. Of course that could be
	clarified later. He was mini-turboing, the closest to 'snaking'
	allowed in this tournament to cut barrierless corners and overtake
	the Koopa King. Gill T. next door might complain about the worn
	tires, again that could be dealt with later. His hairs were rising
	under his long sleeves, so anxious and close to the finish line.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thunder
	crackled, now he needed to beat the rain too! Hm.. Except there
	should be none of that in space.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><b>ZAP!</b>
	Rainbow road was shrouded by a flash that could be seen into the
	heavens.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Lightning
	Strike? Y/N?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The Great
	Eldstar replied yes from his pager, one of several ways he relayed
	information from the Mushroom World below.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Wow!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The Great
	star dropped to his white marble floors, hastily closing his door
	half way.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Can
	I change my bet?&quot; chimed a star kid at work today, Twink.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Too
	late. Misstar will most likely let it go instead of bereaving you of
	your allowance, but you should know better. Karting is volatile,&quot;
	Klevar warned.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	watched the pair stroll past his doorway. At least that added
	context. Some racer well versed in the stars really wanted to win..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
	miniaturized Mario came too, afterimages blotting out all but the
	peripherals of his vision. He bolted from the checkpoint, bumping
	into Bowser, plopped right in front of him from Lakitu. Who's side
	was he on? Bowser bared his sharp white teeth, smug to be in front.
	When a confetti cannon went off near the finish line that was
	quickly replaced with a scowl.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jaw
	hanging, Mario spun to the large display. First place was...</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh,
	thank you dear!&quot; Princess Peach accepted the gold medal from
	Mario, suited for racing and pristine, unlike the rest of the
	scorched racers..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Without
	the typical audience, he figured he'd be the awards presenter too.
	If he'd placed he could have made up a skit for it, pretended to not
	know where the person in his own slot was. Alas not today. He helped
	Peach down first, then Toad, the second place spot quite high up for
	him. The lowest third place position was unoccupied and he knew why.
	Post race, the eleven racers concluded their gathering in the
	garage, scattering quickly. Most of them lived a considerable
	distance away, and the bigger event that would have live spectators
	was tomorrow. Sliding shut and locking up the metal doors of the
	garage, Mario was eager to get home himself. Though he did like to
	win, it was less about his abysmal placement and more about why he
	was such a mess.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Get
	over 'ere!&quot; Bowser ambushed Mario as he pocketed the key.
	&quot;Where is it?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	faced his rival on the rocky Star Road landscape. &quot;Oh you mean
	this?&quot; He untucked the bronze medal from within his shirt.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Well?
	You gonna hand it over?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	swung the ribbon around his finger. &quot;No. You forgot to
	introduce someone.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	Jr. waved from behind his father's leg, who shrugged. &quot;Do I
	need to? Gimme!&quot; He snatched the bronze anyway.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Sorta!
	Also, ouch.&quot; Mario held his fingers almost yanked off. &quot;Really
	needed to occupy that empty trophy shelf of yours, didn't you? Will
	he be at the tennis game?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Suddenly
	Bowser gave the koopa kid a few coins to run over to the snack
	machines, which he eagerly did. They were close by, illuminated by
	one amber lamp above. &quot;No, and I'm not even gonna bother. Now,
	tell me plumber. What's your issue with Junior?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	supervised with Bowser for a moment. &quot;.. It has zero to do with
	the tyke. Ever since you sent him to Koopa Scouts instead of having
	your kooky grandpa, no offense- Kamek watch him, his behavior is
	almost normal.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Great!&quot;
	he beamed.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Almost.
	I guess that, besides my sports being dangerous for a six year old,
	him tagging along with us adds another layer of danger.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	faced Mario vexingly, the medal swinging from his neck. &quot;Wait.
	So we have this Peace Pact thing. You stop blowing up my castles and
	no adventures means we can only call a lot instead of hang out. So
	now we get a chance and.. you act all insecure?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	flushed. As Junior returned with sugary Morel Moxie and questionably
	dated chips, he puffed up for show. &quot;No way, Koopa. Just keep
	your distance.. And your eyes off the princess!&quot; he tacked on.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yeah
	right, bwahahaha!&quot; Bowser winked as a dark object loomed
	overhead, his airship ride out.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Without a
	proper good-bye, they never really did that, Mario slipped away for
	his own snack. He was so late already, he didn't want to annoy his
	roommate and brother by rummaging in the kitchen at midnight. He
	pressed the half busted button for FungusUp and nothing happened.
	Out of stock. When he settled for some Jelly Candy next, he realized
	the entire thing was busted, unlike the adjacent one Junior went
	for. Blocking out commotion around him, the loud horn of the airship
	drifting off course, and Bowser screaming at the operators, he
	scoped it out. If he could carry this home he could fix it. It would
	be any more complicated than repairing his Mach Bike-</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Move!&quot;
	screeched the onboard intercom.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Swaying
	on the port side, the doomship was going down. Mario backflipped as
	the machines and part of the garage was smashed into by the heavy
	anchor, the plumber landing on the steep edge of the floating
	island, tumbling off and splatting on the Rainbow Road below. He
	thought he was in the clear until, rolling on his back, he saw the
	stern of the ship backing into him. It missed that time, breaking
	the rainbow road. He'd always wondered if it would shatter like
	glass. It did, with him on it.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Keep your
	friends close, enemies closer. To Mario that seemed natural, too
	much so, and no matter how many catastrophes spawned from such, like
	whatever that was, he never saw himself changing it.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After a
	two hour visit to the Star Road ER, the fishing line burn from
	Lakitu's timely rescue not that bad afterall, Mario was discharged.
	He left with a mega-vitamin prescription in hand he'd likely not
	pick up, (he didn't trust that distant Dr. Mario relative) and was
	stopped by a traumatized looking nurse handing him a scratchy
	letter.</font></p>
	<p><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">To
	Mario only (OR ELSE): This is 'You know who'. Yeah I think we hit
	something! You! Whoops! Was it that obvious I was training new
	minions with the airships? I'll make it up to you. How? I'll be your
	tennis partner tomorrow! Genius right? We can trash those other
	losers and the money I win can fix whatever. Or I'll just keep it.
	Anyway I changed the forms and everything already by [the word
	'threatening' is scratched out] 'explaining' the situation to
	Lakitu. Get ready!</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">
	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">PS. This
	isn't a ploy to expand my totally not empty trophy case or
	anything..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	folded the letter up, blanching. Now he'd really have some
	explaining to do. His tennis partner was supposed to be Luigi!</font></p>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	groggily leaned up in bed and stretched, awake early. Mario had
	materialized in the opposite side as he expected, tucked under the
	covers, and snoring. The sleep mask snuggly strapped to his hairy
	face was supposed to make him sleep soundly so that at 6 AM he
	wouldn't immediately be lucid enough to slap the alarm silent. Just
	as Luigi rose, Mario's basic Yoshimobile rung, the unknown caller id
	rattling his bones. Besides the odd hour, Mario's number was used
	for emergencies sometimes.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He jumped
	to Mario's bed, shaking him violently. &quot;Brother, wake up!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">'You have
	one new message.' *Beep*</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario's
	eyelids slowly opened as the voicemail began to play:</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hey
	loser, wake up call from: 'You Know Who'!&quot; ~Loud orchestral
	music was in the background of the gravelly voice. &quot;Friendly
	reminder for ya: we gotta win, or the Special Cup's gonna be
	incomplete! That's a problem, because my castles in that cup.
	Alright? Oh, and I got another surprise when I show up. Bwa ha ha!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	shuddered, bumping Luigi off as he scrambled out of bed, searching
	for the the black phone on the black table.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Lastly..
	What's the recipe for that Couples Cake again?... The one you can't
	eat alone?&quot; *Mumbling heard*&quot;- Gramps, no this ain't-&quot;
	*mumbling * &quot;Gotta go. Keep that touchscreen smokin'!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">*Beep*
	'End of message. You have no new messages.'</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Looking
	for this?&quot; Luigi effortlessly located the phone and dropped it
	in his brother's lap. &quot;Better check that 'stranger' out.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	yawned, avoiding eye contact. &quot;Let's consider it spam.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Then
	what do we consider this?&quot; Luigi reached over and tugged on the
	neon green medical bracelet showing under the long sleeve of Mario's
	red pajamas.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	snapped it off, sheepishly. &quot;After the race I was locking
	everything down then Rainbow Road fell!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	gave a start. &quot;Mario, at terminal velocity it could take out a
	city way larger than Toad Town!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No
	worries.&quot; Mario slapped him playfully. &quot;Only a portion,
	and it's handled. It was Bowser's fault anyway, but..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	exasperatedly left. Mario anticipated that reaction, albeit after he
	saw the astronomical bill from that short hospital visit, waived of
	course because of who he was, or- He gulped. Right. He had to
	discuss his rival's immodest proposal with him.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;What
	is that thing?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	settled on a memory foam seat cushion. &quot;One of your gifts.
	Found it underneath your sealed in box copy of Wind Waker.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-I
	have that?&quot; Mario dragged an iron chair over, seating himself
	on the other side of the kitchen table.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Their
	little wooden cottage was warm and cozy already from the morning
	sun. Birds chirped outside and grass in the yard was covered in dew.
	The kitchen was frequently their place to chat and the only clear
	area. From being the sole heroes of an entire kingdom, sometimes
	other ones too, they had a multitude of gifts hoarding them out of
	their home, or at least Mario did in particular. While it was a
	problem they saw years in advance, it snuck up on them somehow
	anyway, and now they were in the acceptance phase, stagnant and
	complacent, sandwiched innocuously in a suburb West of downtown Toad
	Town, because the spectacle of moving wasn't worth it. Mario was
	often out and about , not his way of ignoring the problem he assured
	people, but Luigi knew otherwise. He chose to be a homebody,
	creating paths that didn't create avalanches, and using the
	hazardous home base to wind down, relax. It just happened that it
	allowed him to be privy to the letters addressed to the brothers. Or
	the phone.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yes,
	that's in your assemblage and more.&quot; Luigi lowered his morning
	Toad Town news, eyebrows furrowing. &quot;Are you prepared to
	discuss the Elle in the room now?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	almost stalled with the orange juice, his plate emptied moments ago,
	but his bother's deductive reasoning could be classified as a lethal
	weapon. No point. &quot;So, 'You Know Who' is trying to replace you
	as my tennis partner.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;And?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Well,
	he wrecked a bunch of anti-gravity panels. Those aren't cheap.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	mean-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Then
	yeah.&quot; Mario leaned back, uneasily. &quot;That's it.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His
	younger brother tossed the articles away. &quot;I'll give Bowser
	that victory today. Have fun out there.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	watched him clean up his dishes. &quot;..We are at the top of the
	leaderboards! ..And it'll mess up our streak!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Mario,
	I'm with you all of the time. No worries,&quot; he echoed wryly,
	loading up the dishwasher, after sliding away boxes of mini-marios
	in the way.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His older
	brother waited all the way until they were cranking up the Mach Bike
	for Luigi to change his mind. He never did. Mario fancied himself a
	great biker. He was his own mechanic, so he'd better not get into
	too many accidents. Nonetheless on the route he'd taken countless
	times, he target fixated and scuffed the chrome accents on curbs
	dozens of times. Luigi offered to handle the rest of the way there
	and they arrived in slightly more pieces than they should have,
	safely regardless.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It was a
	sunny day in Toad Town, Mushroomites and visitors gathering for the
	upcoming match at the stadium. Citizens crammed their way in,
	passing by many sidewalk vendors. The green plumber leaving the
	parking lot stopped for one of them.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;...Bowser
	kicked you off the team?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	checked around discreetly, pulling his carry-on back up on his
	shoulder. &quot;Don't shout from the rooftops or act suspicious, but
	yes. Bowser left a voicemail this morning, very atypically.
	Something made him comfortable..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">While
	Toad listened closely, his pitcher full of blue liquid overfilled a
	plastic cup.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;..During
	the confrontation I made it clear that - Toad! That's suspicious!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hahaha
	whoops.&quot; He wiped the spill with a towel. &quot;Guess this'll
	be a challenge then if it's Bowser instead of you.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh
	shut up.. I do think this will be an epic match though, and I'll
	capture all the carnage, believe me.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	was just kidding!&quot; Toad looked at him seriously for a second.
	&quot;Don't take this wrong, but I am relieved. Don't gotta get in
	between you and Daisy like I was dreading.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;That
	would have been nothing,&quot; Luigi assured, pulling down his cap.
	As earnest as that sentence seemed in his head, saying it he wasn't
	so sure anymore. She mysteriously couldn't take her cruise liner
	over for the race after all.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Eh.
	If you say so. Here.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad gave
	him a beverage on the house, not that he needed compensation with a
	tip jar full of gold coins . Actually he still wouldn't need it as a
	toad of noble background and a subordinate of the princess. He
	bothered to read the sign and then it made more sense. Still the
	point stood. It was easy to forget Toad's stature when he was
	simultaneously his bud and exclusive confidant over Mario's and that
	'other guy's' erratic behavior.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Anyway,
	Luigi gulped the chalky drink down, suspecting his friend concocted
	himself instead of allowing their qualified castle chef to assist.
	While his head was tilted up, he got poked in the back. Luigi ended
	up spraying juice all over himself and the stand.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Dummy..&quot;
	Luigi grumbled, pulling his carry bag away from his brother.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	stepped back like nothing happened, all innocently. &quot;Just
	checking up on ya, little bro. Hey Toad.&quot; He waved. &quot;Or
	'Toadette'. You're still playing aren't you?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With zero
	problems manning a stand with a bold and glittery pink banner, he
	retrieved a megaphone. &quot;I was covering for my homegirl is all.
	CLOSE OUT SALE! SHROOM SHAKES HALF OFF!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The Mario
	brothers covered their ears, side stepping as passerby were
	galvanized to crowd in and support Toad's or Toadette's or whoever's
	'Install more monuments of indigenous Fungi' fund. Once Mario was
	off the into the grass, Princess Peach, ruler of the Kingdom
	unceremoniously arrived and whisked him away in small talk. Luigi
	instead went closer to the street, tentatively scoping out the regal
	sports coliseum. Thanks to his latest study project, he was admiring
	it as more than a big building for outdoors sports events, that
	would be deserted in a few hours and left with footprints or the
	occasional wrappers under the bleacher.. The jagged shape of the
	battlement against the blue sky was striking to him. -It's large and
	imposing nature, one of the tallest down town. -It's aged yellow
	brickwork, the foundation laid long before the rest of the modern
	city sprung up around it. It was surely as old as Peach's Castle. He
	retrieved from his bag an expensive camera he'd been training with,
	not that his brother noticed. He snapped a few pictures and then
	rushed to get the kind of seat integral to the rest of his plans.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Soon a
	bus pulled up to the curb, dumping more attendees. A dinosaur rubbed
	his heavy eyes, elbowed a couple times for being too slow.
	Spectating this game would be the first time he'd sit still in a few
	days. Besides the race yesterday, he was always traveling from
	Yoshi's Island to the Mushroom Kingdom via ferries or train, and
	once in town using the modern bus system. If not for cell towers,
	another invention that wasn't around decades ago, it'd be an even
	more arduous task to support anything Mario was involved in.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Of
	course, when the famous hero was on his mind, Yoshi's fianc&eacute;e
	was too. He'd convinced Birdo to race sure, but from her
	dissatisfactory commentary afterwards while they were at his
	treehouse, always when it stung the worse to be honest, he knew she
	wasn't showing to this event. Should he incur a roaming charge to
	call her before entering a loud environment, or settle for a text?
	Dithering allowed a third option to present itself and he did
	neither, sprinting around a ransacked drink stand to rescue someone
	burred under a giant pile of paper cups.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Are
	you okay?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yeah.
	Thanks Yosh,&quot; Toad woozily stood up. &quot;More people care
	about about unappreciated Mushroom history than I thought. -Or my
	last minute sale was fire. I'll imagine both.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No
	problem?&quot; Yoshi muttered, scanning the signs. &quot;Aren't you
	playing against Mario and Luigi?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
	secured the proceeds, handing over a special pass. &quot;About
	that... Just grab a good seat, okay?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	checked that ticket shortly afterwards. It was hand drawn!
	Nonetheless the organizers checking, not any administration of the
	facility, rather zealous Mario fans willing to volunteer, let him
	get a low lettered row, courtesy of the Earl of the kingdom. Call
	the dinosaur paranoid from experience, even crotchety, but entering
	the bustling place, it just didn't appear a robust system. They were
	letting just about anyone in seemed like..</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Accurate
	communication was the cornerstone of advanced civilization, why
	Ludwig Von Koopa believed he was so successful in his princely and
	Koopa Troop commandeering duties. Hearing 'Reprisal in A minor'
	halls before he reached the auditorium however, someone wasn't
	keeping up with the program. He ushered the reserve pilots to fly
	the airship instead of koopalings for a purposeful reason. Now that
	vessel had an infraction on its license, and costly hull damage, but
	no matter. The result should have been his henchmen and siblings in
	tip top shape today, not a door whacking him in the face.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh
	my gosh! Sorry Luddy.&quot; The rainbow haired koopaling, younger by
	a year, exited on his star branded ball, toting five bowling pins.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	held the discolored blotch on his snout. &quot;You are my secretary,
	General Lemmy. You especially cannot afford to dawdle on decision
	day!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
	kept nimbly rolling around Bowser Castle, forcing Ludwig to speed
	walk to keep up. &quot;I thought you said practice for a gig doesn't
	count as goofing off or anything?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Then
	explain the music! My music.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Gets
	me into the zone,&quot; he laughed. &quot;You didn't tell me your
	hit was on the comedy station. Yeah, the 'Delusional Artist Happy
	Hour'.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;So
	ein mist..&quot; They hit steps, Lemmy able to bounce down them
	while Ludwig was rail holding and lagging behind. &quot;I told the
	record company it wasn't a parody and- Oh disregard such. Give me
	that old boombox...&quot; He caught it clumsily. &quot;-Oof. Thank
	you.. And don't expend all your energy with that routine!&quot; he
	yelled down the long dusty spiraling stairwell.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	commander sat on the empty stage, tuning in to WMUSH for local Toad
	Town news. The sports coverage was due up.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	threw another dart at 'Mario'. The metal tipped barb dug in an inch
	deep, straight in the nose. That much was clear in the dim locker
	room, to the man watching in the doorway. Mario in a bizarre lapse
	of judgement, they weren't even super aquainted back then, gifted
	his rival that large poster of himself doing a 'v' sign. He'd always
	hoped Bowser framed it or something, but no. It was tattered and
	crudely taped up to a corkboard, speckled with tiny holes.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	unexpectedly watched him abuse his effigy for a little longer. How
	put together the impulsive, barely organized (he let his son run the
	army for a reason) villain was must have been the 'surprise'. His
	red hair was gelled back and held down by a black and red sports
	visor with a dark sweat band underneath. He also wore a loosely
	fitting red tank top, actual clothes.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Uh.
	Close the dang door?!&quot; Bowser roared, jolting Mario.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	plumber split in. &quot;Yeah, yeah...&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	said hurry up! I've been in here forever and-&quot; The Koopa King
	spun around dramatically. &quot;I'm working with ya! Surprise!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;...That's
	the su-?.. Forget it. Why are you all dressed up over tennis?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He spun
	his purple racket around, stamped with a red menacing emblem. &quot;To
	freaking look good, moustache! It's technically for the princess to
	notice, not you by the way.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	dropped his huge duffle bag onto the benches, flushed. &quot;You
	know that'll only cause a bigger scene. How'd you sneak in here?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	yawned, testing out his powerful and impressive 200+ mph swings, not
	that he was scrutinizing. &quot;Super early. That's how.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Momma-mia..&quot;
	Mario stood up from the unwieldy duffle bag, full of equipment from
	every sport they played and a few they didn't, just not the one he
	needed. &quot;I left the racket 'cause of you!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	whipped his way. &quot;You are so weak.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I'm
	serious.&quot; Mario stepped up, arms folded. &quot;You got me
	sleeping all crazy now, or definitely snoring- I can tell by Luigi's
	expressions in the morning. You know why.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You're
	the weirdo that asks for a peace pact and then wants to avoid me
	like I'm the freaking Koopapox, Goombola, Blorbs- insert some other
	plague!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;What
	the?! The only thing more extreme than you just went, would be the
	consequences of us hanging out. It's not what enemies do. At the
	same time you just assaulted a poster of me that would be
	collectable by now, so I don't think friend covers it either.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Come
	on!&quot; he groaned. &quot;I might as well kidnap Peach again! This
	crap was less complicated then.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	punched his shoulder. &quot;Don't. Do. That.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Why?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;There's
	no such thing as an invasion that doesn't harm people, no matter how
	much 'acting' is going on.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;..So?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">When the
	plumber swung again, Bowser caught it and raised him up swiftly.
	Mario could only flail and kick the air, his boots dangling. Who
	would be daft enough to pulverize their own tennis partner? Him
	apparently! &quot;Listen moustache, whatever's going on with you,
	you need to spill it or get over it. It was strange for me too for
	the first week, but now I'm loving not having you, that Luigi, or
	those toad boys, rip my fortresses and castles part for NO REASON!..
	Ah hm. And most of all I like how easily I can mess with you by
	doing almost nothing.&quot; He increased his pressure on the
	plumber's wrist a little bit. &quot;Like right now, you are
	bothered!&quot; he said low and dangerously, his warm breath
	tickling Mario's ear.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario's
	struggle paused, fighting more against the grin creeping up. Was
	that it? What fiend would torture him then? Or was it torture if it
	wasn't unpleasant? Some sudden outdoors light bleeding in blinded
	the Koopa King, sending Mario to the concrete flooring.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yo!
	Heads up.&quot; Toad poked his head inside the room. &quot;There's a
	lotta dicey rep out here now. That's good for me, beating Bowser in
	front of his own people, maybe not for you tho. -Whoa!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad got
	out of dodge when Bowser flung a spare racket at him. It bashed
	against the door instead.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">'These
	Kingdoms may never quarrel again' is all the pact stated, nowhere
	forbidding active KT to attend entertainment venues. &quot;Bowser..&quot;
	he began.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Nothing.
	You take that. There, problem solved. And don't break it! We just
	really really REALLY can't lose now, alright?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	flusteredly gave the green Bowser emblem racket a few test swings.
	It had a totally different flex than he was used to. With the
	Mushroom Anthem playing, he had to roll with it.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Or to
	match the Air Koopa shoe advert taped to the locker, just 'do it'.
	If it was working for Bowser so far.. At the same time, he had to
	keep an eye on the enemy. Luigi would be watching, and it was always
	'bros before koopas'.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad
	crossed the field to enter his team's locker room.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yo,
	Daze?&quot; he greeted the princess.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	flower princess was still planted on the benches, jabbing at a
	touchscreen with hints of frustration. Princess Daisy wore an orange
	tank-top and shorts and her hair was tied back with a hair band, so
	she looked ready to go. That couldn't be the issue then, Toad
	reasoned.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Huh?
	Oh, yeah. Just remember the formation thing I sent&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;That
	pdf was upside down, homegirl. You flubbed up something.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">As she
	abruptly lifted, he got a glimpse of her wide pretty blue eyes, if
	unfortunately living up to her street name. &quot;Fo real? I mean,&quot;
	She uncrossed her legs, stretching. &quot;I knew it, but thought you
	could, ya know, flip the phone.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No,
	the accelerometer will keep adjusting.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;What?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Nevermind,&quot;
	Toad went, inching closer. &quot;We're gonna beat em. I just wanna
	know if everything's alright.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daisy
	dropped the phone in her messenger bag, staring at the poorly
	drained floor. &quot;It's political stuff from back home, dawg.
	Nothing more.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Really?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I've
	been excavating and blowing stuff up, so basically.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;&hellip;Isn't
	Sarasaland full of ancient treasures and rich resources?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She faced
	him again, brightening. &quot;I had some outta this world reasons&hellip;&quot;
	She explained on quickly. They weren't mega close, not even when she
	still dated Luigi, yet she picked up his non-judgy vibe right away.
	The truth of why she was a loner that people were spreading rumors
	about, ignoring Mario's Facebook scheduled events lately, was about
	to burst put of her chest otherwise.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	get it,&quot; he fist bumped. &quot;Make sure the 'house' is in
	order before fun&hellip; Not that I'm setting a bad example.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;That
	surprises me.&quot; Daisy stood up, gathering her gear. &quot;Peachy's
	always saying, mean, when she messages back, that you're such a
	lifesaver and junk.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Well
	if she's happy I guess we're okay,&quot; Toad went, modestly. He and
	Chancellor Toadsworth, a distant relative to the princess, had a
	different eye for certain issues was the reality, but if Daisy was
	wrapped up in her politics, there was no need theirs too. &quot;Now,
	funny story about Lakitu out here-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He was
	interrupted by the loud reverberation of the anthem, ceiling bits
	falling overhead.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I'll
	tell ya after we win!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Daisy
	threw her items into a locker and retrieved her racket, orange with
	her royal flower emblem in the middle. She ran onto the field after
	he did, finding the toad all over the place, like a hyper spritely
	toad, and not a dude way older than her. The right side of the
	stadium had lots of toads, bob-omb buddies, nokis, piantas, and
	other friendly species. On the left however were more of the same
	with 'enemy' species, bandits, thwomps, and other folks likely to
	root for Bowser sprinkled in. Fans were cheering in the stands and
	promotional agents were on the prowl. One haunted the tanned
	princess down, a dark boo in a baseball cap. So that made sense&hellip;
	He gifted her a paper bag with a soda in it, Fungus Up.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">When Toad
	stopped lapping up all that attention and saw his partner chugging
	that, he felt a little sick. Discontinued, they had a soda machine
	in the castle and verified, all surviving cans had to be mildly to
	completely stale. Still he reached out to the promoter he'd
	successfully evaded to get his own can for solidarity, even if he
	had to hold his nose to stand it. He didn't see Mario or Bowser
	getting hand outs over there.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Ladies
	and gentlemen...and Bowser!&quot; Lakitu and Bowser exchanged nasty
	looks. &quot;In this doubles match we have Mario and, er, his arch
	rival King Bowser verses Princess Daisy and Mr. Toad who.. why
	didn't I cut this out? Ready to rumble! Or something!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	crowds cheered, working into a frenzy. All tennis players were into
	position. Toad and Bowser were hugging the net and Daisy and Mario
	stood farther back. To Mario the competition seemed capable and both
	Toad and Daisy had developed a twitch from an unknown source,
	foaming at the mouth.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thwak!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Faster
	than his eyes could pick up, Mario felt punched in the gut.
	Blinking, it was the ball, bouncing off to the sidelines. Laughter
	could be heard from some of the crowd.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	don't care how bad you sleep now, plumber boy! Freaking wake up!&quot;
	Bowser growled.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;For
	the LAST time, first serve Mario!&quot; Lakitu shot with a cannon
	another ball out there.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	could have sworn it was never said a first time.</font></p>

	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	settled in the nosebleed section and observed everything below.
	About two-hundred feet up, the bright green court seemed like their
	foosball table, the one buried under the junk at their home rather..
	Most of the audience attempted to get as close as possible to the
	playing, endlessly bumping and knocking against each other. Luigi by
	contrast had the space to stretch his arms, or even his long body
	across the benches up there. A wave started in the audience as he
	snapped his first wide lens pictures. He heard a faint noise to the
	right of him then, the unmistakable sound of the air being stirred
	unnaturally by some spectral entity. He dropped his camera and
	whipped his head to the side.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh,
	sorry!&quot; said the milquetoast form, a little boo diddly.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	quickly calmed his palpitations. &quot;Oh, Boo. No I was just... So
	buddy, how have you been?&quot; His gaze darted down to the concrete
	floors, unable to eye his acquaintance directly.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Great.
	I thought you were playing?&quot; Boo Diddley asked.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	was, but you see-&quot; He was drowned out by the Mushroom Anthem
	starting to blast over the stadium. Thankfully Luigi had his out. He
	was rather guilty for 'ghosting' his buddy months ago where they'd
	swapped numbers and said they'd keep in touch. Then the surprise
	Peace Pact and the ennui that followed happened, culminating into
	where they were now, where Mario dragged them into activities for
	the sake of there being something going on in their lives.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh,
	it's starting!&quot; Boo said, squinting down. &quot;Wait, is that-
	Oh no it's Bowser!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi's
	attention drifted to the players getting into position, nodding. In
	his viewfinder he noticed Mario had a Bowser racket. He impetuously
	lowered the camera with an odd feeling. &quot;-Boo, I'm getting into
	photography now, long story, and I need to find a seat closer. -I've
	gotten the footage I need from this angle,&quot; he tacked on.
	&quot;..Wanna come too?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo's
	smile faltered. &quot;I think some of those people work for Bowser!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Exactly,&quot;
	Luigi replied with some irritation.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Everyone
	watching, including radio and news reporters, the song concluded and
	the game was on. Mario's reservations had ebbed away by then basking
	in the attention of thousands. This would be an invidious situation,
	but now it was happening. The thing he'd longed for..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He served
	a topspin towards Toad, who sprinted up and returned the ball.
	Bowser intercepted at the net and sliced hard in Daisy's direction.
	The ball bounced beyond her until she did a back-flip into its path
	again and managed to connect. The ball was but a green blur slipping
	in the gap between Mario and Bowser.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Love-15.&quot;
	Lakitu announced.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario was
	left scratching his head at whatever just happened. He refocused,
	serving again towards Toad who curved the ball around Bowser at the
	net. Mario rushed behind his partner to counter. Daisy however met
	him and lobbed the ball back to their side. Bowser did a mad dash to
	center. He smacked the ball backhanded and so misaimed, someone in
	row F got a free souvenir.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Out.
	Love-30!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	audience thundered, an increase in camera flashes twinkling. Okay,
	maybe this wasn't as Mario daydreamed, not with Bowser impossible to
	control. They didn't stand a chance with Toad and Daisy in perfect,
	suspiciously silent even, synchrony.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Bowser!&quot;
	he half whispered. &quot;If you wanna stick to the front so bad,
	stay up there. Let me clean up.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	grunted in acknowledgment, glaring at their rivals.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario hit
	lightly towards Daisy. As expected the ball was returned, flying
	back. He aimed middle then to test them. It was Toad who sprung
	ahead that time. This resulted in several volleys between him and
	Bowser close to the net. That was a start, at least they weren't
	bleeding points all over the place. Mario paced from side to side in
	case the ball escaped Bowser. Eventually it did from Daisy with the
	meanest topspin he'd ever seen, red flames from the ball as it
	bounced out of his reach.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Game
	point!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	hemorrhage resumed and the first set was won by 'Team Daioad'
	according to the poster boards held by some in the audience. Head
	hanging low, Mario obeyed the call to switch sides. Bowser was about
	to snap his racket in half, or anybody that got too close,
	especially if he wore goggles and rode a cloud, but he lumbered over
	eventually.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">On the
	defensive side, the difficulty dropped a notch at first, the both of
	them having more time to react. Return volleys didn't end exactly in
	their favor however, Bowser, a power character, exerting himself
	extra to keep up with the speed and technique rivals. The Koopa King
	was drenched in sweat, soaking through his clothes, making them
	stick to his chest and muscles. His visor had gotten flung off ages
	ago, and only the black sweat band held his scarlet hair together
	somewhat, so that with every clumsy but earnest lunge for the ball
	it flicked around. Mario tried to search around for Peach. She
	wasn't in the other umpire chair, so the 'show' was for him after
	all. Somehow he knew it all along..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">How would
	he deal with it when moment the game was over, people would flood
	onto the court and open fire. </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">'How
	did Bowser replace Luigi? How awful was it working with him? He DID
	force you right? He won't return, won't he? What about all these
	Bowser Freaks?'</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">
	The latter sometimes ironically spat by Mushroomites that looked
	identical to such 'freaks'. Then there would be Peach whenever she
	reappeared, who'd masked her views on her ex-abductor since the
	pact. Her sly, calculated quips made him </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">shiver</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">
	sometimes. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Or that
	was from Bowser stomping so hard, the huge jug of Yoshi-Ade on the
	sideline spilt over. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;GHAAAAAA!
	I'VE HAD IT WITH THESE LOSERS!&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario's
	attention snapped towards the net. They were back at another game
	point and Bowser was committing a forbidden Power Shot technique,
	turning the ball into a speeding bullet bill. Daisy finally dropped
	her game face in shock, before a last ditch back-flip brought her to
	the corner of the white line. She reflected the projectile, burning
	to a crisp her racket in the process. The regular again ball flew
	upwards, far enough to make a tiny shadow on the ground. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	followed the shadow. &quot;I got it! I got it!&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	shadow moved over Mario's head. He shook himself out of it. &quot;No,
	wait, you- I'll get it!&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	pushed him aside. &quot;You'll screw it up. Move!&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	shoved back. &quot;What the heck? I'm already here, dummy!&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Someone
	spewed loud gibberish then, first dismissed as a deranged fan, then
	starkly recognized. On the other side of the court Toad was making
	strange noises while Daisy did an impromptu handstand. The ball fell
	in between Mario and Bowser with a 'thunk'. Automatically both swung
	for it, clashing their two iron rackets and launching them out of
	their grasp and into the box stands. They could only then watch the
	ball make an additional sad little bounce. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Game,
	Daisy and Toad,&quot; Lakitu announced. He ducked as cabbages and
	rotten cheese soared over his head. The audience again roared at
	Daisy spinning on her head like a breakdance move and Toad shaking
	violently on the astroturf. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
	broke into a sprint onto the field. &quot;Call the medics!&quot; she
	cried. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Just
	in time! I quit!&quot; Lakitu flew away as medics scurried on the
	field. Some attended to Daisy after she collapsed while others
	attempted to stabilize Toad. It seemed neither could explain what
	happened. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;We
	need space people!&quot; sputtered one magikoopa nurse checking
	Daisy's pulse. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Could
	have used a pause after 'space',&quot; remarked his Kong assistant.
	Just then however, they spotted whom they thought was Tatanga the
	Space Alien in the crowds, so they began to pack up and evacuate
	Toad and Daisy out of the tennis court before any baddie got any
	ideas. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	stomped after some of the medical staff. &quot;How dare they quit!
	It was a three game match! Hey! Yeah you!&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	gripped the back of his shirt. &quot;Who quits while they're ahead?
	Leave them alone!&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	sharply faced Mario, smoke pouring from his nostrils. &quot;Whatever.&quot;
	He leaned against the stone wall of the arch shaped tunnel. &quot;We
	woulda made a friggin comeback! We woulda! ...Where's my extra green
	racket?&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	shrugged. &quot;I don't know. Probably somebody's consolation
	prize.&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	punched the bricks, crumbling them. Mario inched backwards, pale. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Uh..
	or I could look for it maybe.&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No
	no no..&quot; Bowser shook his head. &quot;Just my duffle bag. It
	has a disguise for me and, in case you didn't notice, I can't just
	walk around!&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dang,
	alright. Mario dug in his ears.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi,
	located as low as row C caught Mario and Bowser losing the first set
	spectacularly. Crowds screaming and their gesticulations nearly
	knocked him over. He hoped they would be a little more behaved for
	the second set. Toad and Daisy were 'on fleek'. Eh, no need to go
	there just because Boo was so young. Anyway, the Sarasaland Princess
	had for a certainty made use of the fitness equipment he helped her
	set up in her basement, shortly before they.. He didn't want to go
	there either, taking some arbitrary close ups of her and then her
	maniac partner Toad, zipping all over. Even Bowser flailed around
	being a tryhard for some admittingly nice pics. He couldn't help but
	to snap pictures of his brother with his head in the clouds. The
	sides switched, the game a game and not a massacre. Next he knew the
	game suspended and medics were entering the scene. He shot out his
	seat. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;What's
	going on?&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo froze
	up &quot;We'd better get out of here!&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	packed his camera away. &quot;Clearly, but I already see pileups at
	the exits.&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo
	startled him by grabbing his hand. The green plumber's vision went
	dark for a second or two before he felt his feet on the ground
	again. They were outside the stadium once one, phasing through the
	thick walls of the building. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	looked around, astonished. &quot;Thanks buddy,&quot; He said,
	checking his phone. &quot;Mario texted to go ahead and rush to the
	hospital.&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;..
	It's serious?&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi dug
	in his pocket for the keys. &quot;If he's telling me to leave him
	behind, I'm afraid so. Sorry it's goodbye so soon. Where are you
	staying now?&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo
	plastered on a smile. &quot;Forever Forest. I inherited a cabin from
	my mom. She's not dead dead, just living super far away with
	relatives in Gloomy Gulch. Since I was out of school I was a big kid
	and could watch it and keep the moss off, and protect the antiques
	inside that's where I've been all spring-&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Through
	all that nervous babble, Luigi shifted uncomfortably. &quot;Ever
	rode a bike?&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo saw
	his parked out there. &quot;..Aren't those scary?&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Factually
	yes, but the statistics are skewed by people like my brother.&quot;
	He brought out his helmet. &quot;If you tag along, I could simply
	drop you off home later,&quot; he offered. &quot;Better than being a
	curator of a museum right?&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Y-yeah.
	I would!&quot; they responded. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Soon
	Luigi was cranking up the Mach Bike in a rarely held driver's
	position for the second time that day. Could he regret drawing
	someone like Boo into their mischief and drama? It was possible.
	More optimistically, if Mario and co got more used to seeing Boo,
	maybe they'd would be invited out more. Seemed like a risk worth
	taking, the magnificent coliseum scrolling out of view.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	waded through the dense crowd, slipped into the locker room, and
	returned to the open with Bowser's army tan duffle bag on one
	shoulder and his own on the other. A few steps in he decided he'd
	leave his own heavier bag behind. Peach called security, not so
	subtly for the Bowser supporters and adjacent in the crowd, then
	whisked herself away with Toad and Daisy via medical helicopters. He
	could not help but feel the unceremonious disappearance was
	intentional. There were no barriers to the court and every sort,
	locals, reporters, outsiders, and obvious Koopa Troop could prance
	about. Mario ignored a random fan, a reporter, and a Bowser minion
	giving him a stink eye, and where the net was- </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Mario!&quot;
	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	couldn't ignore this one. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Mario,
	I have enough for the bus. Come on,&quot; said his dinosaur friend.
	Yoshi strolled alongside him, studying his confused expression.
	&quot;Well, ready to go?&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;S-sure!&quot;
	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Who knew
	the Mushroom Bus was a Pinna Park tier experience in his own city,
	mashing the riders into the well worn seats as it swung around Toad
	Town's tight corners, or bouncing several feet in the air when the
	deepest potholes were hit full speed. It was like the driver weren't
	afraid of being reported from the helpful 'How is my driving'
	sticker on the coin collector box. A touch petty, Mario was
	preparing to write that number down, when Yoshi snatched his arm. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Was
	anything peculiar about Bowser?&quot; he asked sharply. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	felt himself flush. &quot;No,&quot; he managed. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The dino
	sat his home d&eacute;cor magazine on his lap, still securing the
	plumber. &quot;So you planned the substitution?&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Okay
	yes, that was weird. Other than that-&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hmm..&quot;
	Yoshi returned to the magazine, concentrating. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	unfamiliar duffle bag Mario cradled didn't have 'Property of Bowser'
	stamped on it anywhere, and no one witnessed Bowser using it, but it
	was obviously not Mario's and it smelt like the cologne Bowser was
	known to spray too much of... Or at least Mario knew that was the
	kind he wore too much of.. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He held
	his breath until they arrived at Mushroom Kingdom Hospital, a three
	story building made of whitewashed stone on the Eastern side of Toad
	Town. It consisted of a center tower connected to a left and right
	wing. A mushroom flagpole was atop the roof which also was the spot
	for their airlift services. The waiting room bustled. After
	pardoning themselves they made it to the darkened reception office
	where the head nurse named 'Nassir Toad.' was stationed, an orange
	cap toad with long straight black hair and purple designer
	prescription glasses. Nass T. did not greet them, facing her glowing
	computer screen, mouse darting around the mouse pad frequently. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Excuse
	me. Hi, it's me Mario. We were checking if Toad and Daisy are in?&quot;
	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Room
	444,&quot; she droned without thought, then her thin eyebrows rose
	sharply. &quot;-They will be there soon Mr. Mario, I mean. So please
	wait until we call you.&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario and
	Yoshi eased themselves back to the front lobby. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Waiting
	around, keeping the bag on the shoulder away from Yoshi when he
	could, Mario believed he recognized some faces from the tennis
	match, toads, nokis, bob-omb buddies, piantas, other friendly
	species.. Then peering out the large glass windows he saw his
	brother in the parking lot. One quirk only he'd notice as an expat,
	the modern architecture was ready for an influx of personal
	vehicles, yet the actual citizens weren't, predominantly using the
	buses, walking, or flying with power up.. Peach's spiciest take ever
	once was that Mario Karts scared many straight. And she wasn't
	complaining either. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi and
	a guest came in, blanched upon ripping off their helmets. Everyone
	gathered before a wall of tourist vouchers. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;How
	did we beat you?&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	glared at his brother. &quot;The buses, yours because I saw you in
	it, speed everywhere. We almost got ran over five times! I was so
	scared!&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Aww,
	come over here!&quot; Mario grabbed him, ruffling his hair to his
	dismay. &quot;It's worse onboard, trust me!&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Mario,
	cut it out. It's serious.&quot; Yoshi admonished lightly. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Sorry.
	They have them but we have to wait,&quot; Mario explained,
	attempting to gel Luigi's hair back to how it was. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	slapped his hand away. &quot;Fine. Mario and Yoshi? This is Boo.&quot;
	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo shyly
	revealed themselves &quot;Hello, hehe..&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	offered a hand. &quot;Hey, I'm- nevermind you know who I am. You
	seem like a swell guy.&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Actually,&quot;
	Boo began. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Girl?&quot;
	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Well..&quot;
	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	should stop, shouldn't I? Cool to have you here. Now, where's the
	cafeteria?&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	lightened up, sniffing the air. &quot;Great idea!&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	took the new friend's arm. &quot;We'll be back. Not hungry.&quot;</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	was sorta hungry.&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh
	really? Sorry about that.&quot; He turned to the boo with him in the
	grass lot in front of the hospital, watching as the double doors
	continually swiveled open to devour more occupied cots. Flipping
	through the contents of his camera's memory card hadn't revealed
	anything like he was desperately hoping. &quot;It was a quick
	excuse. I didn't want my brother or 'Detective Yoshi' to see any of
	this. You can go back if you want.&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No,
	I was hungry. Now I'm not..&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The green
	plumber stood up. &quot;This next place I want to check out is
	calmer. You might like it.&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">... </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
	parked on the sidewalk before the Mushroom Press, office space in
	the heart of the city. In a perfect version of this day, Luigi would
	have donated his best photos to whoever was bored enough to want to
	write about the zero stakes tennis match. Did he ever wish he was
	right. On the way in, Luigi noticed the boo shaking. They quickly
	assured him it was nothing but a tick. The press had an open floor
	plan, office cubicle walls sectioning it off. Luigi scanned around
	for Kylie Koopa, ace reporter and writer of Koopa Kronicles, a
	newspaper detailing events and happenings with a less stringent,
	'allied enemy species' leaning than the unregulated Toad Town
	message boards. She'd responded on the nearly dead forum, and
	recommended the camera Luigi ultimately bought. He spotted the back
	of her pink shell in a cubicle and approached while Boo remained
	behind. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hey
	Kylie. It's Luigi,&quot; he greeted. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Sup!&quot;
	A female koopa in a green hat stumbled out, sending paper
	everywhere. Others around her eyed her exasperatedly. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She'd
	initially planned to skip covering it, but two superstars needing to
	be airlifted in the middle of the match piqued her interest again. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Wow!&quot;
	She pulled him into her space, lowering her tone with great effort.
	&quot;Maybe we gotta dig deeper for a clue. Cameras don't lie.&quot;
	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;That's
	what I kept telling myself.&quot; Luigi unhooked his lanyard. He
	just wished he'd developed the eye better. &quot;Would you like all
	I have?&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	plopped into her chair, digging around in a drawer for a card
	reader. &quot;Thanks fella, finally some exclusives! Phew! To keep
	us from fighting, Steve just hired some Susie Que over there to do
	it. He has this bonkers ideal that us journalists are a team.&quot;
	She swiveled around, unamused. &quot;He's a great boss, keeping this
	a neutral place. Let's just say we let him wishful think.&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	watched over her shoulder while clicking through the photos from the
	computer. The gallery started from most recent, medics on the field,
	to hovering over Daisy, a powerful woman who didn't faint even in
	one-hundred degree weather sprawled out in agony. Queasy, the green
	plumber realized how much he was suppressing his panic. That was his
	girl friend, spacing intentional, and his best friend possibly
	dying. Kylie kept it moving to his relief, to the less macabre
	content, but that wasn't enough. He actually small talked for once. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	noticed that new plaque at the entrance. Is that the 'Mitch Toad',
	the other guy that get's called Weegee sometimes, I think?&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">From the
	reflection in her other shut off monitor, he saw Kylie roll her
	eyes. &quot;Yep. Superseded me a month ago, and sly as ever. He's
	right there by the way.&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	twisted around to the cubical across. A green toad in a suit was
	seated in an more furnished space. A steaming coffee mug sat next to
	a gold name plate with his name on it. Detecting his eyes it seemed,
	the toad paused whatever he was doing and rolled his chair partially
	into the hallway, thick black eyebrows down turned. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Don't
	waste that guy's time, babe.&quot; Mitch antagonized out of nowhere.
	He had a deep voice and a thick Mushroomy accent, unanticipated for
	such a small time villain. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah,
	toad or not Luigi remembered. That was Peach's old heckler,
	weaponizing his free speech protected newsletters against her. He
	had a bike route the old school way, highly successful. There was no
	phone or internet competing then, so why not pour over his rumors
	with an unsettling amount of truth to them. Luigi wished he knew
	what made the switch flip, why he went to targeting random
	celebrities and 'influencers' for the entertainment block. Either
	way his work now was more scrupulous... Well by the way Kylie
	chucked a pink eraser at Mitch, starting a shouting match, maybe
	not. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&hellip; 
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo was
	getting some water from a dispenser beneath the cork board, clipped
	articles pinned, some awards, and an emergency post-it. Signed by
	Mario himself, it had his personal number and another for Peach's
	Castle, only for the purpose of contacting him if the other failed.
	Boo couldn't fathom being that open. A contact list that fit on one
	screen gave them anxiety when one actually called, and yet Mario
	invited anyone. Boo spun around, startled an other boo entered the
	Press. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	blonde stringy wig bounced as they floated across Boo's vantage
	point. Locking on to them, the dark boo smirked. &quot;Hey, bro.
	Long time no see, hahaha..&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The cup
	of water slipped from the little boo's hand as they bolted outside. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi ran
	up, catching the front door clack against the stopper and made his
	egress, leaving behind his memory card. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Darn,&quot;
	Kylie grumbled, picking up her papers and newspaper clips crumbled
	during their quarrel. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Darn
	indeed, babe.&quot; Mitch kept taking up space in the hall, fixed on
	the side with the photographer. &quot;Don't mess with Susie,&quot;
	he warned spontaneously. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	huffed, dropping them on her desk. &quot;Can't be worse than you!&quot;</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Pssst!&quot;
	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	turned to his red plumber friend, inches from the helpful map of the
	hospital's layout tacked to the wall. &quot;What?&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I've
	found the room.&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Mario,
	we... Can we?&quot; Yoshi replied with some hesitance. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	chuckled, wrapping his arm around the dinosaur. &quot;We can. Relax.
	We won't enter, only wait closer. It's efficient!&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Placated,
	Yoshi allowed himself to be nudged along. Room 444 was on the
	opposite wing of the hospital and it was hectic everywhere. Codes
	kept blaring over the intercom and so many patients were being
	wheeled around. Yoshi waited until they reached the West wing's gray
	painted walls and a pale beige textured floor, then he bite the
	bullet and held the phone to his hear. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hey
	baby. I know you're worried sick. I'm okay.&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Worried
	about what?&quot; Birdo answered impatiently. &quot;It's over
	already?&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	stumbled a bit. &quot;Yes, canceled,&quot; he explained, detailing
	all the bits up to where they were now, waiting outside the rooms
	Toad and Daisy were purportedly in. He waited anxiously for her
	response. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I...
	Need to process this.&quot; She hung up, gaining some inflection
	before she did, but he wished she gave him more. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	glanced at Yoshi and then away, whistling idly. Door 444 was before
	them, no light leaking from underneath, and Luigi wasn't texting
	that he was back yet. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Sorry,
	Mario. Couldn't delay calling the missus.&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;...Oh&hellip;
	It's okay to not tag along sometime.&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Nonsense.
	Not when Bowser is forcing you to play with him, potentially riling
	up supporters to break the peace pact! Just think of how much debt
	they put the Kingdom in, and it only takes one of the KT scum to
	usurp a hotel sized facility. Remember that scheme of Bowser that
	nominal fans of yours like to forget about or discredit to this
	day?.. Well I do!&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	exhaled. &quot;You do all my adventures. You're the best, pal. Ha
	ha.&quot; His phone made a sound. &quot;(Oh thank God..) Luigi's
	back!&quot; Mario ran to meet his brother, carrying around a small
	admissions ticket. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;They
	just gave me this when I came in and asked about Daisy or Toad.&quot;
	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ignoring
	that episode, Yoshi examined it, stamped 'visitor room 444'. He
	handed it back, a flicker of fear on his normally reserved face.
	&quot;The volume must be out of control, and staff overwhelmed to
	resort to this archaic system.&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;So
	that golden ticket equals permission?&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;It's
	Princess Peach pink.&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;It's
	an expression, Yosh, you smartarse,&quot; he laughed. &quot;I'm
	going.&quot; Mario knocked before they could say otherwise and
	pushed himself in. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Inside
	the room were Toad and Daisy in beds, white blankets up to their
	necks. There were numerous iv and medical instruments attached to
	them, displaying readings rapidly fluctuating. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Nurse
	Azul, I told you!-&quot; The koopa doctor exploded. He noticed
	Mario's stunned face and staggered back from Daisy's bed. His
	disposition changed in an instant. &quot;Ah hem. Hello, I am Doctor
	Professor Koopa. If you received a visitation pass, I'm afraid that
	might have been preemptive.&quot; His dark black eyes locked Mario
	in place, so that the koopa doctor met him in the doorway. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;..Oh,
	whoops! Sorry doc. We'll let you do your thing.&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Perfect,&quot;
	the doctor replied, thin fingers curling around the door handle.
	&quot;Give us half an hour. Alright? Alright.&quot; The door shut in
	their faces. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	made a show of pulling up his sleeve, aggressively clicking the
	timer on his digital watch. &quot;And now!&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Doubly
	so.&quot; Yoshi said, starting his. &quot;Where is Boo?&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;At
	the food court.&quot; Luigi stifled his laugh. With Mario still and
	simmering, what was wrong was clear. &quot;Earth to bone head
	brother, that's not your bag!&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	switched the strap to the opposite shoulder. &quot;Whaaaaaat? Guess
	I'll have to deal with it on the way to Peach.. waiting for us.&quot;
	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Way to
	change the subject, Luigi plainly saw as they continued through the
	West wing. With a blue shy guy nurse almost running them over with
	his cart, he chose to see it as a blessing. Outside were tables for
	luncheons and where fundraisers or other activities may occur. They
	were drawn towards a blue tent furthest back, a 'Make a wish on a
	star foundation' booth where Princess Peach was seated and engrossed
	in conversation with someone else. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I'll
	take that, plumber-breath. Thanks for holdn' it!&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario's
	mouth went dry as Bowser snatched his duffle bag away. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Bowser,
	I suggest you get back before someone sees you!&quot; Peach warned. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;How'd
	he get here?&quot; Luigi demanded. &quot;And with you, Princess?&quot;
	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;He
	bullied his way onto one of the last medical helicopters from the
	stadium, justifying it because 'Mario stranded him'.&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Conjecture.
	Besides, if so it would only even the score.&quot; Yoshi nodded to
	Mario. &quot;Would it not?&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Don't
	start this!&quot; Peach said, visibly strung out. &quot;I wanted to
	inform you all that I know Dr. Professor Koopa is on the situation.
	He once worked at my castle and I'd have none other than the best
	for Toad and Daisy.&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hey,
	he was with me too!&quot; Bowser boisterously added. &quot;I
	remember that wacko. He was a mad scientist at my castle for a
	while.&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	wasn't sure what to make of those two sharing a hiring choice, or
	Bowser lingering around. &quot;Bowser, whatever. Get out of there!&quot;
	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	jumped out of his seat again. &quot;Our tennis rivals are here!&quot;
	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Unconscious!&quot;
	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	marched in his face. &quot;Duh! That's why I have this!&quot; He jut
	out before Mario a yellowed tattered scroll, the official
	Darklandian decree of defeat. &quot;Those losers left the court
	first, so they forfeit and WE WIN!.. Don't look at me like that,
	moustache. I was the other half of your team, why can't I be here
	too?&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	turned to his friends. &quot;Hey.. Is it really that worse than at
	the stadium? At least in here it too busy to notice a Koopa King is
	shuffling around.&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach's
	countenance was covered by a brochure. Why wasn't she surprised?</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo
	hovered around in the bathroom following the last panic attack. The
	relative at the press was one of their cruelest, not that they could
	articulate it much to Luigi. Exact details seemed blotted out in
	their mind. Boo tried to relax in the food court until the lunch
	time rush made it too loud, leading to this moment. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Shake
	yourself out of it. How are you going to help Luigi when a random
	relative and crowd of people do this to you?&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Squeaks
	of shoes traveled past the door. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yes
	sixty at this point. Why?..&quot; a person said. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Someone
	else mumbled something. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Well,
	I just got a call from that partner. I've decided we will do things
	different- Hold on, we have a code blue on floor three. You answer
	my calls only while I'm gone, and if it is who I told you about just
	now, put it on hold and tell Nass.&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yes
	sir. I won't leave here. Even for lunch...&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p>&hellip; 
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A minute
	later. &quot;Lunch break! Guess I'm leaving,&quot; the same voice as
	the last said. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo
	pressed open the bathroom door. No one was around the section of
	rooms: room 441, 442, 443, </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">444</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">.
	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo crept
	out slowly when the strangest coincidence occurred, an older modeled
	cellphone identical to theirs went off with the same 'Ashley's
	Theme' ringtone Boo had for years. Without thinking they answered
	it, picking it up from on the medical cart. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hey
	this is Isle Falsa Hospital again. I just called my bank and the
	funds will totally be on your way tomorrow. You can do what we
	agreed now.&quot; Beeps and blips of a computer game was in the
	background along with some clacking of a typewriter. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo let
	out an exclamation, trying to hang up and shove the phone back where
	it belonged. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hey!
	Transfer me to your boss!&quot; the person on the line hissed. &quot;If
	you try something funny, you'll regret it. You'll be found in a
	freaking puddle of blood and brain matter!&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With a

	Koopa circled in red ink a particular spot on her fold out map of
	Toad Town, specifically where the tennis stadium was. Since Luigi
	informed her about the illness many were stricken with, including
	Toad and Daisy, she had to pinpoint the source of infection.
	Scanning over his photos the only curious details were the unusual
	representation of Koopa Troop in the crowds and little lime green
	objects reflecting the sun&rsquo;s glare, ostensibly something
	edible like a beverage. This food object was predominantly found on
	one side of the stadium where mostly Toad Town locals were. Upon
	zooming in on Toad and Daisy&rsquo;s court, their trash cans even
	had that object in it. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	pondered, idly tapping her pen against her notebook. That thing
	could have originated from any vendor outside the stadium.
	Furthermore Susie Que&rsquo;s snapshots of the same match
	predominantly omitted the object, along with care and skill
	befitting the professional photographer they claimed to be, but that
	was another matter.. Clinging to that flicker of a lead, she grabbed
	her purse and slipped on her walking shoes from under the desk. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Strolling
	out, her gaze wandered towards the other main row of cubicles, the
	one that eventually led to her boss Steve the Bullet Bill&rsquo;s
	office. Susie appeared to be flagrantly goofing off on the office
	computer yet again, but she didn&rsquo;t want to lay it down on
	their first day and earn a nickname like &lsquo;Karen Koopa&rsquo;.
	Something caught her one foot out the door, a small buzzing
	sensation. She rolled her eyes hard, knowing the source instantly.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Whaddya
	want, Mitch?&quot; She forcibly swiveled Mitch's chair around to
	face her.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	need to speak to you, babe. That new guy down there-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	don&rsquo;t wanna hear it.&rdquo; This was the toad that told her he
	got a headache the moment Susie stepped in. Maybe the photos were
	lackluster but that was plain rude. &ldquo;Just worry about
	yourself, greeney.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	don't think you understand,&quot; he replied chillingly. &quot;If
	you have to go to the stadium, be careful. That's all.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After
	Kylie departed, Mitch kept watch over Susie's space until the lunch
	bell rang. Everyone working made their way out in one group. When
	the dust settled, as predicted, Susie was missing.</font></p>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">For the
	people of Sirena Beach, the only worries on their mind was if their
	sunscreen would be up to par against the rays of the tropical sun.
	Tourists dotted the golden shore, lounging in chairs or under
	umbrellas to soak up the last of the daylight hours, some even
	intending to hop on the short ferry to Pinna Park later for the
	after dark parties. No one paid attention to the dark blue shelled
	noki passing them by on the trail to Hotel Delfino. The most average
	tourist imaginable, he had sunglasses and wore a red loose fitting
	Hawaiian shirt. The hotel's lobby was moodily lit, tropical and tiki
	styling all around, along with the ubiquitous fresh fruit.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A bemused
	pianta clerk quickly glanced over and stamped his documents. Filled
	out legibly, he was certainly not local despite species, nor had a
	sip of Chuckola Cola. &quot;So, here's the card key. Enjoy your
	stay, brah.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Merci.&quot;
	The guest climbed the stairs. Less traffic than the elevators. On
	the top floor was his single bed room with all of the usual
	furnishings, and a great view of the shore from the patio. Just one
	issue&hellip; The guest corrected the slightly crooked watercolor
	painting showing off Noki Bay. Alluring, and surely more so in
	person. It would have been his travel destination if maintaining his
	identity wouldn't be near impossible around so many of his own. He
	slung his giant suitcase onto the bed, free to do so vacationing
	alone. He packed flowery shirts of all colors, a wet suit, a wallet
	with a badge, and a silenced handgun&hellip;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After
	settling in his phone vibrated. He answered. &quot;Here safely. No
	interference.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Glad
	to hear, Agent 0064,&quot; Agent N, the voice on the other line
	replied.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh,&quot;
	becoming casual, &quot;I think I packed some of your neckties by
	mistake.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Ah!
	No wonder I had to settle for the bows today.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Those
	look good on you, Jeremy!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No
	one else at HQ thinks so. Anyway, an issue sprung up just as your
	plane left,&quot; the normally monotone agent ventured uneasily. &quot;My
	niece saw some 'Mario game'- don't know which, and got sick.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Mon
	dieu!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-I
	know, Jelectro. Don't come rushing home yet. With the
	counter-terrorist operation you were just on, too much movement
	might alert enemies. Alright? I'll call later, babe. Don't have too
	much of that cola stuff until then. Over.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The line
	disconnected before enemy spies could trace the call. Watching the
	beach from the high vantage point, Jelectro found his inner peace as
	fleeting as the light on the horizon. He had to do something, and
	not that 'cola stuff', not that he drunk without his partner N
	anyway, and packed right back up. He knew without needing to
	physically look, that the desk guy was away from his stations
	drinking some durian tea, and he could sneak right out. He also knew
	some lifeguards were picturing some beach goers with less clothing,
	and they really needed to not do that with a telepath around.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Five
	people re-entered the hospital from the employee back door. They
	bypassed bundles of inventory on way into the large kitchen. In the
	middle of the noon lunch rush, the brigade of cooks were busily
	preparing a variety of meals. Peach darted to the head chef, a toad
	with a brown twirly mustache and a tall white hat, whispering
	something in his ear. He nodded just as the others spotted Bowser in
	the rear. A chain reaction of screaming, pots clanging, white flour
	clouding the air, and eggs cracking to the floor resulted.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The chef
	clapped two pans together. &quot;Ze Princess has spoken! Ignore Big
	Koopa!&quot; he ordered.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
	scoped out into the cafeteria through some round windows. &quot;I am
	afraid we will have issues beyond here.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	gave out a frivolous laugh to their annoyance.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	have to catch up Boo,&quot; Luigi said, stepping beside the
	princess. &quot;You see them anywhere? Especially since we're
	</font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">tolerating</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">
	King Koopa now.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	wasn't even doing this for 'that' reason. It was only fair, he
	screamed inside. &quot;Luigi!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Luigi
	what, Mario?&quot; He marched up to him, their noses almost bumping.
	&quot;It's enough wondering what the heck's happened to our friends.
	Now we also have to chaperone him??&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I-&quot;
	Mario noticed something. &quot;Everyone follow me real quick! Except
	for Bowser..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The red
	plumber shuffled them into the closest secure place.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;M-mario,&quot;
	Peach wrapped her arms around herself, shivering. &quot;W-why d-did
	you p-push us into the f-freezer?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Just
	for a sec Peach,&quot; he turned to his brother. &quot;Luigi, did
	you snap pictures of the game?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi's
	deep sigh fogged the space, holding the camera. &quot;I was still
	learning and I didn't want to be pigeonholed as your photographer by
	revealing this too soon. This is also the second time you've avoided
	the subject.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Make
	it a third, because what did you notice?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	shifted his weight. &quot;..It's a reach isn't it? There was a green
	soda going around for anyone without a Koopa Troop stamp. Typical to
	exclude them.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Of
	course, Bowser people don't deserve freebies like what the message
	boards were advertising in the park this morning,&quot; Yoshi added,
	scrolling on his phone.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	princess was officially intrigued. &quot;That reminds me of
	FungusUp, though it's long gone and the factory shut down ages ago.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Darn..&quot;
	Luigi muttered. He wasn't sure if the road he was going down was
	terminated or if that was his cue to divert. Either way, Peach spoke
	his mind.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-And,
	can we leave the walk-in freezer now, Mario? Frozen peaches are not
	a menu item here!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	relented to her. &quot;Okay, just, let's keep our eyes peeled. I'll
	keep Bowser in check, don't worry, until we can see Toad and Daisy.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
	emerged, the warmth from the kitchen blasting their faces. Promptly
	they split from Mario. Bowser was leaning around against the back
	wall when Mario walked up to him, tapping his foot.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Don't
	get too comfortable, Koopa. If we're gonna take up space back here,
	we're gonna be useful. What size apron will fit around your giant-?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	looked at him crazy. &quot;-What?&quot;</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
	went through the entire building to the front, surreptitiously using
	side passages. Her passive outer face hid many nerves. An emergency
	like this during peace times? How fortunate for her that Dr. Prof.
	Koopa worked in her sanctioned health facility. He was a little too
	conciliatory on the helicopter pad, but she could forgive that with
	wicked Bowser there and spreading fan-fiction about his reputation.
	That's why she sought to speak to him again and clear it all up
	immediately, not play Sherlock like the men. The sterile, brightly
	lit lobby was quiet now; a patient in a cot had not shot through
	those double doors for a quarter hour.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;May
	I ask, where is Theodore?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Nass
	filed freshly spat out by a printer records. So dense of a stack,
	Peach prayed they didn't represent every new patient. &quot;Wait at
	his office,&quot; the head nurse answered.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
	power walked there, finding the door locked and the lights out. &quot;How
	wonderful..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	resisted the urge to fuss. Back in the day when it was only staffed
	toads, they'd stumble over themselves to accommodate her. Alas that
	was outdated and not particularly relevant thinking..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Don't
	they know I got a bad leg? Screw the weight limit,&quot; mumbled a
	whomp at the end of the hall, suited in a wrinkled white doctor's
	coat. Back facing her, he trudged to the elevator.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
	ignored the cautious voice in the back of her mind. Mr. Toad was
	everything to her, and poor Daisy.. It made no sense to be mere
	acquaintances with another princess like they were. There was always
	a divide, especially when Peach was reminded of how much of a well
	oiled machine Sarasaland comparatively was, and it got to the point
	where she didn't even return all of her messages. It couldn't end
	like this, and she didn't need more regrets.. She sprinted up to the
	third floor, exploring the seemingly deserted area where 'Board room
	#6' drew her attention. Out spilled some staff, an elderly toad
	woman, the whomp from before, a blue shy guy nurse, a first
	responder, several junior assistants, and lastly Doctor Professor
	Koopa, slipping something into his pocket.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	quickly came up. &quot;Dr. Professor?&quot; she called softly.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He spun
	to her slowly. &quot;Hello again. What is the matter, 'Sweat Pea'?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Not
	to interrupt, but is there a prognosis now?&quot; She hesitated
	before adding on, &quot;For my friends and any others?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	corners of his mouth stretched into an even wider smile, not exactly
	the response she expected. &quot;My dear, what 'others'? You know
	your hospital is the superior option to that Dr. Toadley locally, or
	those hillbillies down South. Logically we're swamped with sufferers
	of various ailments.&quot; He gently lay a hand on her shoulder,
	scanning a pda. &quot;Your folks need a little extra time. Precisely
	five minutes.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Very
	well, Doctor. Thank you.&quot; Peach blushed. The first thing she
	swore to do after taking over the kingdom was to be more patient and
	listen compared to her predecessor, and she had to exercise that
	now.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Good
	girl.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	princess departed with one elevator while the second next to it
	opened. A nurse, a toad girl resembling a shorter version of Nass T.
	rushed out, colliding and collapsing with the koopa doctor.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Sorry!&quot;
	She pulled him up, snapping his joints. &quot;I'm Emery T., roof top
	emergency services dude. Did I miss the big vote?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Doctor
	Professor slapped away the girl's hands and climbed up on his own.
	&quot;Miss Emery, your ballot wouldn't have counted anyway. Keep
	your butt out of private matters!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">As he
	yelled the pipe above rattled, the main water line leading below.
	Someone on ground level was flushing over and over to make a
	dinosaur deterring ruckus.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	tapped repeatedly on the stall door anyway. There didn't need to be
	any feet to spot underneath, he'd heard the sniffling. &quot;I know
	you are in there. Luigi is searching everywhere, worried. Again
	what's wrong?&quot; he reiterated as comforting as he could.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Y-you
	wouldn't understand.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Can
	I try?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;...It's
	a lot of things. T-the game, the chaos, and.. some people I saw..
	and.. Bowser and..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	carefully found his words. &quot;Boo, if you don't mind, how old are
	you?.. Twenty-five? I experienced many troubling events even younger
	than that. No the trauma doesn't magically go away, especially by
	steeling yourself through it and nothing more. Who else do you have
	besides Luigi? ...No one? Well we can all support each other. Take
	Mario for instance. He was going to be prominent and successful,
	maybe president in the Real World before had to start from scratch
	here.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The stall
	door unlocked and crept open with one beady eye looking out. &quot;Was
	he?..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	leaned away, thinking back. Some of that were inference rather than
	from the plumber's mouth, not that he was trying to be some Sherlock
	or anything, but he believed in it. &quot;Er, basically. My point is
	the greatest, flawless seeming people had been though difficult
	things too, so there's nothing wrong with you-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;There
	is something with...my cousin.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Huh?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The door
	was kicked open, Luigi panting heavily and gripping a plunger
	tightly in the doorway. Their stunned faces and no pipe bursting
	catastrophe to be found, dropped his stance, understanding then that
	he'd been trolled by a nurse. &quot;Never mind this, guys. What's
	up?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	held his tongue, letting them handle it.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;N-nothing.
	I mean, I didn't want to sound like a weirdo at first but.. I
	changed my name to Booigi the Second..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	stepped up, studying his friend. &quot;That's why you were here?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yeah.
	Just practicing saying it outloud, hehe.. Also the first Booigi name
	was taken,&quot; Boo clarified nervously.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Nothing
	else happened?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Umm.&quot;
	The boo circled slowly. &quot;I have vintage style phone and this
	nurse did too, so I picked it up accidentally and heard some weird
	stuff.&quot; They relayed some of it.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	slapped himself. &quot;Quick, put that down so we can show Mario.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi did
	so, hiding his attitude. Wasn't the onus on him? &quot;While didn't
	want to be pigeonholed as Mario's photographer OR Boswell, that
	doesn't sound like normal procedure. Since it's time, let share this
	at the room..&quot;</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
	koopaling yanked off his headphones, springing up from the couch in
	a huff. The den of Bowser's castle was here he and his siblings hung
	out often, spacious and full of lounging furniture and
	entertainment, and no pesky military influence. For the teen with
	the blue mohawk, the issue was that it was never concurrently.
	Everybody navigated their day differently when school was out. This
	should have been his time. Instead he was needing to confront the
	'Wendy Menace' as some of them were calling her now that she was
	seventeen and an adult *almost*. Well just Iggy said that, but for
	once the nerd came up with something cool-</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Pause
	whatever you're downloading. We're out of bandwidth!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The ocean
	princess remained stomach down on the carpet, playing the
	Playstation 4, and the wide projection tv didn't change from the
	account setup screen either. If only Dark Land didn't have lame
	ISPs, even for literal royalty...</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	scowled. &quot;Hold on, gosh! It's just an update.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
	turned to the screen. &quot;Why are you making a new account anyway?
	Iggster's not good enough?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Indeed
	it isn't. It was one thing when I played casually. Now I'm gonna
	scream if I have to explain to my friends one more time why I have
	all of these cringy, thirsty, avatars and achievements.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Thought
	the problem was that yo friends and his beefed?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;What
	friends of Iggy? Sam Koopa and.. something? Their usernames are in
	l33t, whatever don't care. No. I gotta credit card and I'm gonna use
	it.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No
	more freeload'n.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	tossed a spare controller at the fifteen-year old, making him dive
	on the couch. &quot;Hush. I have privileges to use this TV and you
	don't anyway. ~Buh-bye!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
	groaned, punching a pillow over and over. Yeah, because he was
	caught doing the worst thing ever according to Kamek. ..Speak with
	Mushroomites online. Such a sin.. Meanwhile Wendy and Iggy had
	unbridled Sony supremacy up in here and Lemmy in the other smaller
	rec room with Nintendo (which was for babies). He grabbed his beat
	up laptop, hinges getting looser by the moment. A present from last
	year, the teen had already worn it out. It was his only outlet for
	music production and web activities, forbidden or not.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Attention!
	All koopalings meet in 'the room', now!&quot; a text went to all of
	the koopalings simultaneously.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Nope!&quot;
	Larry replied.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Now
	you sound smart, sugar!&quot; Wendy's bejeweled phone sat aside, she
	proceeded to download 'Princess Parlor 7'.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After
	checking for prying eyes, Ludwig reentered 'the room' and seated
	himself on an upside down mop bucket under the single flickering
	light bulb. Their secret meeting location frequently shifted, and
	this dusty broom closet certainly wasn't the most luxurious of them,
	but more Koopa Troop in the castle than ever necessitated it. Only
	Roy, Lemmy, and Morton showed up to the cramped space.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	got koopaball practice, Luddy. Make it quick.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Roy,
	I told you to cancel that. You cannot be present for it today.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Roy shot
	up and gave his eldest brother a noogie, completely ruining his
	styled hair.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Stop
	it!&quot; Ludwig struggled with him.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Psst,&quot;
	went Lemmy, twirling a broom handle between his fingers. &quot;We're
	doing like, a thingy today Roy. It's not Luddy being Luddy.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The large
	koopaling let him go, sheepishly. &quot;Oh yeah!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Will
	I have time to send off the draft for my 'Bestest, Most Superior,
	Most Exquisite Thesaurus Ever'?&quot; Morton asked. &quot;It was
	funded, subsidized, sponsored!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yes,
	Morton, if soon!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Can
	I call King Dad about something unrelated to our plans?&quot; Lemmy
	revealed a cellphone with different colored buttons and a pink
	plastic shell, a gift from turning twenty-two last month. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Somewhat
	concerned, Ludwig remarked bluntly, &quot;I thought Vater purchased
	you a real cellular phone?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy did
	a sort of 'trick' and uncovered his hand again, revealing a
	different one with a giant FHD touch screen, unused and still
	covered in plastic. &quot;Psych! I knew that.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	parted away some blinds, viewing the airship field. Why the closet
	had that feature, he was unaware, but it was why it made the
	potential secret hideout list. &quot;You know what? If discreetly,
	brother mine. You are all dismissed. Our preferred ride isn't
	present anyway.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Airship
	one?&quot; Morton piped up, excited. &quot;Kammy took it on her
	spending sprees, her flea market rummaging, her marketing
	massacring...&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">On the
	way out, before tapping his father's contact, Lemmy savored the
	protective plastic peel off. The budding circus star was certain
	that was how they got people to annually camp outside the
	Yoshi-Apple store for the new model. It was just that satisfying!</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Do
	you want to deliver koopasta?&quot; the chef asked, poking the
	biggest baddest 'cook' with a rolling pin.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;DO
	I LOOK LIKE A DANG WAITER?&quot; Bowser bellowed. With a puff of
	smoke he returned to the one task the red plumber supervising from
	across the large salad table could convince him to do without
	blowing up.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lunch
	proceeded at breakneck pace. Most of the patients weren't eating,
	but the extra staff called in to handle the surge were starving,
	along with visitors. Mario must have prepared fifty bundles of hand
	made pasta, so much even he was almost getting sick of it. Routinely
	he'd check on Bowser as he'd promised, in fact it was hard to look
	away, not that he was enamored or anything. Bowser fumbled basic
	measurements and boiled water wrong somehow, yet perfectly slice the
	Gorgeous Steak on the grain. Due to the Koopa King, the protein
	station with meat, bone-In Cut, and hamburgers was on point, ahead
	of the other stations. Only one Mistake early on to boot. Mario had
	a feeling that was only the fringes of Bowser's culinary skills..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Zat
	ist it for now!&quot; the chef declared, hanging up his hat. &quot;Good
	job on zat last ticket.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Phew!&quot;
	Bowser went, stabbing the sharp butcher's knife deep into the
	cutting board cathartically.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario,
	rather bravely after witnessing that, approached behind him. &quot;We
	still have time to help with the ala carte and the buffet menu
	items. It'll be fun. Get over here. Hear me? Let's go!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Paws
	off, Moustache!&quot; he growled, foreignly being tugged along by
	his rival.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Miserable
	and having his guts squeezed up by that tight apron, he was tasked
	to stay cooped up out of direct view, serving scoops of green peas
	through a small window to presumably whatever staff and visitors
	couldn't afford the fancier menu items, like what he'd grilled for
	the mushroom brats. Meanwhile Mario was free to run around in the
	open like an idiot, delivering dishes to some of the tables who
	would predictably fawn over his presence. What doofuses. He bet they
	knew little about Mario, especially not the small stuff: That his
	favorite levels are the water ones contrary to popular belief, that
	he created Mario Kart based being a cabbie for a week, that he's
	allergic specifically to the orange chocolate candies, or that in
	the Real World he was called, instead of 'Mario'-</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hello?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Waking
	up, Bowser gave the toad girl two giant helpings of peas. &quot;There.
	Get your vitamins in.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Emery T.
	glanced up from her tray. &quot;But I hate peas, Bowser&hellip; Wait
	it's BOWSER?!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Nope!
	I'm uh, a fake one!&quot; Bowser ducked out of the window, only the
	spikes on his green shell visible.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Dude,
	your sprite has the exact colorization. I would know, I've dressed
	up as a Fake Bowser a few times. It's really you!&quot; Emery
	gushed, holding up the line. &quot;I'm your biggest fan!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	leaned up, baffled. He was used to some desperate koopa chick going
	through this spell before he let them down, not so gently. Was that
	mean, yeah, but everyone, at least that was old enough to be a
	contender, knew that Clawdia was going to be his last.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Okay,
	I get that look when talking about you alot. Lemme prove it.&quot;
	Emery raised a gold Bowser brooch necklace. &quot;See? Only you can
	save this hospital.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Someone
	impatiently tapped her shoulder. &quot;Excuse me ma'am-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Go
	around me then!&quot; she barked at the panser ambulance driver.
	&quot;-But anyway, doctors are being ordered to administer some
	'sedative'. I missed an important meeting so I don't know who to
	complain to anymore. You're not Koopra Wenphry, I get it. Great show
	by the way, but people still listen to you. Help, please!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Whoa!
	Slow down, gal. What's that to do with me?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Emery
	paused. &quot;..King, I'm talking about Mr. Toad and Princess
	Daisy!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh..&quot;
	Bowser showed himself too much, as angry staff waiting for Emery to
	move her behind noticed him. They ran, dropping their trays and
	shrieking for Mario. Bowser quickly shoved the serving spoon to the
	nearest cook. &quot;Take this. Uh, I left my clown car's lights on!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	have no handsssssss!&quot; the fire snake complained in his wake.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	scrambled through the kitchen and rolled through the back doors.
	Catching his breath, he expected a mob to pour out after him any
	moment, then he felt absurd for getting spooked so soon.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His phone
	rung, shocking him twice. Now he really hated life. &quot;Hey, this
	is Bowser. Who is it???&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hi
	King Dad,&quot; Lemmy greeted, bouncing down a long red carpeted
	hallway with Ludwig watching him close. &quot;Remember those minions
	who left to the Mushroom Kingdom to see your tennis game?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;That
	thing I didn't ask for anyone to do? They came back didn't they?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Most,
	why I needed to talk to you. The tally is-&quot; He began mumbling,
	&quot;Mmm mm mm!...&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	kept his arm around Lemmy's face. &quot;Give me the phone! Hello,
	Vater?...Never mind those absent Koopa Troop operatives. We will
	handle the matter so do not hurry your way home.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
	sick of me?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Great.
	I wanna go home anyway.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	mean, we are. It's terrible here.. And a 'slow' internet day. Stay
	there.&quot;<br/>
Well Ludwig rarely lied, so Bowser considered it
	seriously. &quot;Fine, go away.&quot; He hung up.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
	didn't have to lie,&quot; Lemmy said, the moment he wasn't being
	strangled. He didn't sustain any injury or scratches, but wore his
	mean face, making Ludwig lose some confidence. &quot;King Dad has
	more than enough incentive to say there. He's definitely sticking
	close to Mario.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Why?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Do
	I have to say it?&quot; Lemmy rolled away.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Now
	Ludwig was really freaked out.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">When
	Bowser dragged himself back in, as unsuspecting as possible, he
	found no hysteria in the cafeteria anymore. Peeking further out the
	window, the crowd had thinned out and only a few were still eating
	at tables . As he ripped his hair net and apron off, he noticed a
	little note near his station with a number scribbled on it. He
	pocketed that, not knowing what else to do right then.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Is
	every first day gonna be like this?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;As
	long as we're at max,&quot; replied an older hammer bro, washing
	dishes.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The young
	dorky lakitu that inquired seemed pretty disappointed wiping down
	the stainless steel pass, which is where Mario appeared, motioning
	for Bowser.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Thanks
	for making me have to convince a dozen terrified people that they
	imagined Bowser serving peas.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	tried to shrug it off. &quot;Least I did what cha said!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	smiled then. &quot;You did good. Better than I anticipated, frankly.
	Peach says it's go time. Wait a sec.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Moustache?
	I can just walk out of here?&quot; He watched Mario retrieved
	something scarlet from the storeroom, tossing it over.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yes
	you can, grandmother.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	untangled himself from it. &quot;The heck?&quot; He slipped his arms
	through the thick woven fabric of the hooded cloak. Mario added two
	accessories, a medical face mask and a silver walker.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;There,
	we'll come around and reenter from the front with you as an old
	grandma I'm helping in.&quot; He encouragingly draped his arm around
	him, a little too comfortable with this plan already, Bowser felt.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He went
	along with it anyway, strolling onto the sidewalk together and
	rounding to the front double doors. How did Mario lure him this far
	down the trail of stupid? They retained the semi embrace too, when
	it wasn't needed for sure. A lot of folks mean mugged him, even
	ostensibly as a koopa that needed help. Okay, Mario being so close
	to him, enough for his body heat to spread over- koopas were
	sensitive to that, was possibly needed. A little.</font></p>

	Koopa departed from the bus a block down from the tennis stadium.
	There were yellow banners blocking the entrances but no competing
	reporters or police. The latter not in the traditional sense, but
	there were entities out there aside from Mario and she'd dread to
	end up in their cruddy clutches for trespassing. She sleuthed the
	area, camera hanging from her neck, starting with the rear of the
	colosseum-like structure facing away from busy Starman lane.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Her spine
	was then rattled by a frigid sensation, mistaken at first for a cool
	breeze but dismissed just as quickly. It felt like it came from the
	inside. In seconds her fingers were too stiff to handle the buttons
	on her camera. Rubbing her hands together desperately, she trekked
	through the dark tunnels into the tennis court, quickening her steps
	when she heard a motorcycle purr coming closer from the streets.
	Trash and other items blemished the court, redolent of a rapid
	deterioration of order. Crestfallen, she rationalized that the green
	object she was after would now be like a needle in a haystack.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	couldn&rsquo;t give up however. Looking around, she was jolted by a
	shadow moving in the corner of her eye. The source of such evaded
	her despite her efforts. She found nothing out of place in one
	locker room, but upon leaving she stumbled over a red duffle bag
	laying round. Kylie gleamed, it was Mario&rsquo;s, proving further
	the audience were abruptly dumped outside after the tragedy.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Before
	she could check the other locker rooms the chill went away and now
	her skin smoldered, like she was melting. She was stumped at what
	was psyching her out during routine reporting. Stubbornly pressing
	on, she took note of the orange hair band on the ground and- bingo!
	There stood the waste baskets, well used since Luigi&rsquo;s photo
	was taken, and filled to the brim. She prepared to dig in as gross
	is it would be when-</font></p>
	<p><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ding
	ding ding..</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">
	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Those
	chimes seemed distant yet frighteningly in her ear simultaneously.
	Woosily she lost her balance in that moment, bumping and tilting
	over the can. Emerging from that brain fog, she was startled again
	by the gruff voices of two men in an altercation. Cursing and
	yelling, their voices bounced around from somewhere under the
	stands. It could be guards, civilians, anything, she feared. The
	koopa reporter hurriedly photographed the contents that had spilled
	out of the trash can and sprinted out, picking up Mario's bag on the
	way. If this was indicative of her performance when she skipped
	lunch for 'the scoop', she vowed to never do it again. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Grandma&rsquo;
	Bowser took up three seats and scowled behind his mask at anyone who
	crossed the &lsquo;bizarrely intimidating old koopa lady&rsquo;. He
	didn&rsquo;t </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">want</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">
	company of Mario, or specifically his mushroom freak friends, but
	that was better than the alternative. Whether he liked it or not his
	brain was on a different mode when things were casual and not in a
	&lsquo;game&rsquo; so he couldn&rsquo;t help but acknowledge that he
	was, dare he say, &lsquo;vulnerable&rsquo; in enemy territory. To
	bat those thoughts away he grabbed the closest magazine, something
	rather suggestive and unexpected for Peach&rsquo;s hospital to have
	on hand, an old &lsquo;Play Koopa&rsquo;.</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Far
	down the West hospital wing, Mario abruptly stopped before room 444,
	making the others step on his heels. Not meaning to get caught up in
	himself like that, he apologized and let the others trickle in ahead
	of him. On edge like this, having Bowser stay back was definitely
	the right choice. Inside the dim room stood a whomp doctor, his
	large blocky form hiding whatever the monitors stationed in between
	Toad and Daisy&rsquo;s bed displayed. Unceremoniously, he spun to
	face Mario and crew.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Just
	checking records,&rdquo; he droned, waddling around them. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Excuse
	me, doctor?&quot; The door slammed shut behind Peach. She had not
	done hiring here for ages but she knew that one was an oldie, an
	expat from some land, &lsquo;Isle Falsa&rsquo; or something or
	another. That matter slipped her mind when she ventured closer to
	Toad&rsquo;s bed. She gasped and covered her mouth, unable to speak.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi&rsquo;s
	older but discerning eyes caught something on Daisy as well.
	&ldquo;..Mario, do they look green to you too?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	bolted forward. The bed squeaked as he leaned against Daisy&rsquo;s
	bed in shock. &quot;Oh man! Bro, getta look at this!&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	flicked on the light switch located near the door, brushing past Boo
	who had remained frozen since they&rsquo;d come in. When their eyes
	adjusted to the bright sterile lighting, it was obvious what
	petrified the boo diddly. Toad and Daisy lay stiff as a board in the
	bed, skin hued sicky putrid green, the computers continually
	flashing foreboding yet uninterpretable readings. There were no
	sounds in the room, not even the beep of a heart monitor. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;&hellip;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">This
	room looks..more..like..&rdquo; Boo choked up at what came next. &ldquo;A
	morgue.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
	caused the princess and Luigi to wail sharply. She latched onto
	Mario. &ldquo;Eldstar, it cannot be!!!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I-It&rsquo;s
	not!&rdquo; Yoshi corrected, struggling to keep his voice steady. He
	brought his ear up from Toad&rsquo;s chest first and then Daisy&rsquo;s.
	&ldquo;They're still alive- for now.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">As his
	own palpitations clashed against her&rsquo;s, Mario gently eased out
	of the princess&rsquo;s embrace, holding her upper sleeves. &ldquo;Look,
	Peach. It&rsquo;ll be alright. We&rsquo;ll get them help, okay? I
	need to update &lsquo;You Know Who&rsquo;. Probably better in person
	than texting. In the meantime please, PLEASE drag one of those sorry
	white coats back in here. If they can&rsquo;t give a real
	explanation I will personally give them the &lsquo;plumber whack&rsquo;&hellip;&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser in
	the lobby had one leg crossed over the other, flipping through the
	second crinkly magazine he found laying around, &lsquo;Kart and
	Driver&rsquo;. That previous one wasn&rsquo;t to his taste he
	realized quickly, but this last one captivated him enough to
	convince him to try to sound out the bigger words. He could use a
	new kart or two whenever they got back to doing that sort of thing
	again. Eventually there was only one other thing to read within
	arm's reach, the short note from that nurse. Scrawled on it was a
	number with a Town Town area code.. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hey.
	I'm.. &lsquo;You know Who&rsquo;. This is Fangirl chick, right?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">On the
	roof at the hospital's airlift station, Emery hopped up and down
	squealing. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yeah
	yeah...&quot; He asked her to recount her story..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	eagerly did. &ldquo;...And the staff here aren&rsquo;t helping the
	patients, King. When I first started I had a few people I was cool
	with, but they got steadily replaced with these weirdos. I need your
	help!&quot; &quot;Okay chick, I mean.. sure but watch out yourself.&quot;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Don&rsquo;t
	worry about it. No one pays attention to me up here. Oh, and thank
	you thank you thank you! You know, when I was young my mom Nass, a
	total trip, would try to tell me scary stories about you, but I just
	thought they made you sound cooler and I was a fan ever since. I'm
	kinda still a social outcast because of that&hellip; or maybe
	because I don't mind seeing blood and guts and stuff... Sorry I&rsquo;m
	rambling. I have an old coworker who can help me out I think if I
	call his- Gotta go, King. Bye!&quot; She hung up as an helicopter
	was approaching for landing.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Back
	inside, the Koopa King remained skeptical of the narrative, but she
	had a point. What was so complicated about letting him walk into a
	patient room? He suspected this wasn&rsquo;t a big deal anyway, just
	theatrics that he&rsquo;d be able to suss out in record time. Mario
	was just imposing extra rules to flex, to revel in holding the
	power. Safe in his home turf, this contrasted their typical out of
	town secret meetups where the plumber had to watch over his back
	warily.. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He stood
	up, yanking his mask off figuratively and literally. Next he ripped
	off the scarlet cloak, allowing its frayed remains to bundle at his
	feet. Someone noticed his presence in the lobby and screamed,
	causing a chorus of alarm. Their terror reignited Bowser and he
	belted out a maniacal laugh involuntarily, unceasing until someone
	stood before him. The red plumber dropped his head towards the
	disguise reduced to shreds, confused and horrified alike. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	snapped shut his dumbphone, staring his rival down with extra
	intensity. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m seeing our tennis rivals whether ya like
	it or not!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	leaped acrobatically to Bowser&rsquo;s side and pulled his spiked
	collar down to his level, flipping into character in the blink of an
	eye. &ldquo;I don't think so, Koopa! Time to take out the trash!&rdquo;
	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Underneath
	the spontaneous applause from the grateful dozen eavesdropping,
	hidden behind the heavy double doors that partitioned the lobby from
	the East and West wings, Mario dragged Bowser through the automatic
	doors with him. The moment they were outside and out of ear shot he
	crossed his arms. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Why&rsquo;d
	you do that??&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	just wanted to see 'em.&rdquo; His frenemy smirked again. As
	infatuating as they were, they simultaneously made Mario&rsquo;s
	blood boil. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	was just about to let you. Jerk..&quot; He seized the koopa&rsquo;s
	arm. &quot;I&rsquo;m serious. It&rsquo;s awful in there so let&rsquo;s
	go. We can sneak in the window.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sure..&rdquo;
	Bowser replied airily as they walked along at a leisurely pace.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">When a
	bob-omb on the public sidewalk looked at them puzzlingly and turned
	the opposite direction, something dawned on the plumber and his face
	flushed. &ldquo;Crap! Hurry!!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	started to tug Bowser down the sidewalk then, even as sparks
	threatened to fly from the koopa&rsquo;s dry hardly moving feet
	scraping across concrete. Next a bemused birdo on a bike spotted
	them hand in hand from across the street and was so distracted she
	smacked into a stop sign. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Cringing,
	Mario looked back. &quot;You can try lifting those things, you
	know!!&quot;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	freakin know that!!&rdquo; Snapping out of a daze, enwrapped by
	seeing Toad Town somewhere other than from the vantage of an
	invading Doomship, Bowser cooperated somewhat and they briskly made
	it around the block to the West wing. There were a few camera
	flashes Mario noticed from some passing cars. He guessed he didn&rsquo;t
	have to be holding on to Bowser publicly like this, but how else
	would he make sure the most feared enemy of the kingdom couldn&rsquo;t
	bounce? Bowser must have taken sick delight in this, or at least
	Mario thought so with how much the Koopa King kept giggling at
	nothing.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Enough,
	dummy!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toad and
	Daisy&rsquo;s window was partially obscured by bushes and shrubs
	that they wasted no time diving in. Mario heard some sort of alarm
	blaring over raised voices, all muffled by glass. He felt in vain
	around the sides for a latch. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Of
	course a plumber can't operate a window..&rdquo; Bowser carefully
	applied pressure to the entire pane, making something creak.
	&ldquo;Whoops!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser!!&rdquo;
	Mario jut his arms out to catch the glass. It then slid off his
	gloves and inside the room, shattering on impact with the floor. It
	bumped one of the computer status monitors and it went out of the
	dummy mode it was in, displaying a standard Mushroomsoft 10 OS
	screen. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
	gasped, spinning away from the blue shy guy nurse she was speaking
	with at the door. &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	lifted up the blinds, revealing Mario and Bowser. When Bowser leaned
	his big head in, his smile dropped abruptly, stomach churning at
	Toad and Daisy&rsquo;s state. How affected he was all a sudden
	surprised even himself.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;So
	it wasn't a false alarm after all. Like, I gotta tell someone, bye.&rdquo;
	The nurse swiftly left, sneakers squeaking down the hall.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi,
	Luigi and Peach collectively groaned or close enough as the only
	nurse around willing to talk to them slipped away. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Did
	you learn anything?&rdquo; Mario asked, climbing inside.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No,&rdquo;
	Peach responded curtly. &ldquo;And the alarms mean some sort of
	security is showing up. Dare I ask what prompted such?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	pinched between his eyes. They had no choice but to do the
	unthinkable. Explain the situation.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dark Land
	had a diversity of environment seldom recognized, super stormy in
	some urban areas, swampy in others, and dry and parched around
	Bowser Castle. That soil became the cushion for an out of control
	airship, sending an enormous dust cloud in the sky.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
	yanked off his headphones after he felt a particularly large quake
	in the floor. &quot;Sis! That's too much bass from the stereo!&quot;
	he yelled over the TV. &quot;Even for me!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Without
	diverting her attention away from her dating simulator, Wendy flung
	an extra extra controller at him. &quot;That's Morton's craptastic
	CD that still plays even after I've scratched it five times on
	purpose!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The music
	cut as Morton spun around from the trio of 18 inch stereo cabinets,
	suspicion in his grey eyes. &quot;Did you just say that you damaged,
	defaced, vandalized, my limited edition, rare, compact disc from DJ
	Deadbone5?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy was
	in the opposite corner of the room scooping up the multicolored
	blocks from his life sized structure that was rattled apart by that
	same thud. He was adapted to ignoring most of the fuss going around,
	but getting a whiff of smoke in the air made him second guess.
	&quot;Anybody smell smoke?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy's
	head snapped up from the green translucent Gameboy he was buried in.
	With a lanky shape, and lime green hair gelled to sprout from his
	head, he didn't need that collectable to be unmissable. &quot;My
	radioactive microwave downstairs!... Hahaha, no that blew up last
	week because of Roy's burrito.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Shuddup,&quot;
	Roy griped from the other more ragged couch, one of the older and
	larger koopalings.<br/>
All the while, trying to drown it all out,
	Larry kept feeling more anxious. He knew why when they got a group
	text.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Attention!
	Mandatory meeting behind the castle!&quot; the message stated.
	Unanimously, his sister even pausing her game which she would never
	otherwise do, the koopalings filed out.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;F!&quot;
	Larry whispered.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Behind
	the castle, their primary airship was embedded bow first. Orangey
	red dirt mounds from the impact were littered up to a mile away,
	some even making it onto the rooftop of the castle. Despite all of
	that, Kammy Koopa was able to squeeze out of the emergency hatch on
	the top and slid down from the hull to the ground like nothing had
	happened, arms full of bags. Evidently, she'd shopped till she
	dropped.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;~Dearies,
	I got something for you!&quot; Kammy sang, shuffling across the
	field.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	crone, their 'cool grandma' was cheered for. Larry compartmentalized
	it, having nothing else to do as the last to come up: Kamek was the
	'koopalings are ordained warlords', Kammy was the 'you're just
	kids!' and Bowser in the middle. Sheesh.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Meanwhile
	a particularly Ludwig sized dirt mound started to jiggle, scaring
	him.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Freaking
	what is that?&quot; he gasped.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bloodshot
	eyes appeared from the mound, followed by a red hot face and then
	the rest of the body. &quot;What in Eldstar's name is wrong with you
	crazy woman?!&quot; Ludwig screamed.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kammy
	coyly strolled up, her head poking around the stacks of shopping
	bags. &quot;Luddy-dear, you know how I have lil problem reaching the
	brake pedal sometimes, ee hee hee! Now chill out, boy!&quot; She
	tossed a yellow Banana Bird Republic bag full of hair spray his way.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	eldest koopaling caught it on reflex then dropped it to the ground.
	&quot;Everyone focus!&quot; He snapped his fingers. &quot;Time?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
	checked his artsy 'wrist watch'. &quot;There's been exactly zero
	minutes and no seconds since we've been standing here.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Lemmy,
	your watch is drawn on your wrist with crayon. Ooh, I should invent
	a watch that can freeze time like yours!&quot; Iggy giggled.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With a
	loud aggravated huff, Ludwig went ahead and dashed inside the
	airship so fast Kammy spun in place, shopping bags flinging off.
	They waited awkwardly until Ludwig emerged from the hatch. Using a
	thick colorful quilt, likely as-seen-on-tv at some point, to shield
	his nose and mouth from dust, he sat there instead of sliding down
	and seemed to be busy dialing a number on his phone in an irritated
	manner. They all knew who it was, and that it wasn't to call
	anything off either.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
	squeezed his eyes shut. Most of Ludwig's schemes didn't make it off
	the ground. How did this crazy one? He was almost desperate enough
	to approach Roy, Morton, and Wendy rummaging through Kammy's outlet
	mall treasures. They didn't really want this did they? Then again
	they were such Koopa Troop supporters.. He diverted his attention to
	Iggy, hoping the eighteen year old would even get it. He was
	outsiderish too.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hey,
	Iggster!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Hands
	off, sonny! I need that to keep up with the sock, cauldron, and
	cooking ware collection,&quot; the elderly magikoopa slapped Iggy
	with her broom.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy held
	the pocket calculator over her short stature. &quot;And I'll totally
	trade you another, but first let me borrow this and harvest the
	proprietary and out of production CPU microchip. Sam and Slam took
	my other one before they left this morning in the trucks!...&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry's
	conniption had him kicking dirt and getting his foot stuck. All that
	was left was Lemmy, Ludwig's secretary if only due to strict
	hierarchical rules, patiently balancing on his ball and drawing a
	new minute hand for his watch. Larry knew he was screwed, as
	embedded in this mess as their airship was in their rotting
	backyard.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Very
	good, we may proceed on our trip,&quot; Ludwig said upon returning.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yeah
	right.&quot; Wendy pouted. &quot;Daddy's gonna freak.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	dropped a bundle of shovels before their three toed feet. &quot;Are
	you certain? Riddle me this, sister mine. What has two thumbs, a
	shell on its back, and Ludwig Von Koopa as their supreme commander?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy
	quickly answered, &quot;About 432,283,432 nearby organisms,
	Luddy-sama!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;That's
	larger than the Koopa Troop today. And under the last regime. And
	the previous. Combined!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;He
	was complementing you,&quot; Lemmy snuck in there. &quot;Basically,
	you'll rule the world?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh...
	Well the answer is you all. Get to work!&quot; Ludwig ordered, tying
	that quilt around his neck. Coastal breezes made it unexpectedly
	cold if no volcanos were erupting. That was his maneuver, not hiding
	his blush.</font></p>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mitch
	Toad&rsquo;s black luxury sedan skidded to a stop at one of Starman
	Lane's many red lights. Scratch papers rolled up in his lap
	contained interview questions for a movie star, among other
	appointments for the day. The glove compartment was unsuccessfully
	ravaged for more facial tissues and aspirin for the searing pain
	behind his eyes, and his nosebleed continually stained his expensive
	suit. Despite this he was glad he braved venturing from his hidey
	hole at the Press. That &lsquo;creep&rsquo; knew better than to
	target his ex and coworker, fully aware Mitch knew what they were
	capable of the moment they walked through the Press&rsquo;s doors..
	The light changed green so he mashed that pedal. Traffic was thin
	except for a bus about to pass on the opposite side.</font></p>
	<p><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~Ding

	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Fingers
	curling around the leather covered steering wheel rigidly, the
	toad&rsquo;s blood ran cold. Ringing behind his head was the sound
	of- Then before he could react, a mushroom bus was veering into his
	lane head on. The vehicles collided with a terrible metallic clash.
	His car&rsquo;s aluminum frame warped and compressed, shards of
	glass from the windshield spraying Mitch as it flipped into the air
	and somersault off the street into the park. The public
	transportation vehicle kept rolling for some time, the driver a warm
	corpse in the seat before the crash occurred. The ghost bus came to
	a grinding halt when it overran a brick hedge down the block. Back
	in the park, within the mangled remains of the Lexus, an airbag
	deployed at last. This partially awoke Mitch buried inside,
	conscious just enough to realize that he could neither move nor
	scream&hellip;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The first
	person to notice the accident was Koopa from the park. Jogging in
	place he began to call emergency services and remained on the line
	until he was whacked in the back of the head with an object, a green
	Bowser racket a number of people might have caught a glimpse of at a
	certain tennis game. The unconscious fitness junkie collapsed at the
	feet of a dark figure with no feet at all. Surveying the carnage,
	the attacker's eyes squinted slightly due to astigmatism, but their
	lips curled upwards in satisfaction.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Write
	a story on this, bro,&quot; the person mocked, leering into Mitch's
	driver window. Then they vanished like the boo they were&hellip;</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Back in
	Room 444, Yoshi, Luigi, and Boo remained with their friends for the
	moment to watch out for that security to roll down the main street
	and hopefully give the others a heads up. When Yoshi excused himself
	to make a call to his fianc&eacute;, Luigi shyly glanced over to see
	how his friend was holding up.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Are
	you okay?&quot; Boo asked him first, catching him off guard.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Not
	really. It feels like for every step forward it's two back.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo kept
	their focus unwaveringly on the highway, the bright shiny colors
	from the occasional vehicle sweeping by mesmerizing. It wasn't new
	to them, but living in Forever Forrest for that short time had made
	it feel so. &quot;I think I'm used to that,&quot; they said vaguely
	as a more vibrant than usual work van was crossing&hellip;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Up front
	Peach concluded, &quot;-So you did not need to raise alarms. Bowser
	is roaming I must admit, but 'civilly' I suppose you can say. A more
	important matter is that- let me just say we highly suspect the
	staff of squandering time.&quot; While the ringing alarms were
	disabled in the lobby, they were still faintly audible in other
	parts of the hospital and red lights continually flashed as well.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;We
	are still determining their condition,&quot; Nass answered.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-These
	people giving you-? Ah, uh, nevermind. Hmm hmm hmm..&quot; the whomp
	doctor hummed in passing from the East wing to the West.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
	forced herself to ignore that. &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she lied.
	&ldquo;You stated that the call for security came from within this
	facility, so would you know who authorized that unnecessary
	measure?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">We
	do not know that either.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...Oh
	why did I ever hire you back then as the receptionist!&rdquo; the
	princess blurted, immediately regretting it.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Nass
	stared blankly before shooting up from her chair. &quot;If you have
	a problem with how I do my job, take it up with Dr. Professor for
	crying out loud! Don't complain to me! I&rsquo;m following orders!&quot;
	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">This sent
	Mario over the edge. He&rsquo;d stood beside his princess for
	support, letting her handle the matter to add credence to the fact
	that she owned the place. It was obvious now the staff were just
	messing with them.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh
	of course you don't know. Just like how our friends are changing
	colors and you think we're stupid enough to believe that none of you
	have a single clue of what's wrong with them!&quot; Mario slammed
	his fists down on the desk. Meanwhile Bowser entered as 'himself'
	and remained near the door, unnaturally silent and downcast.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	defiance visibly drained from Nass as she collapsed into her seat,
	holding down a button. &quot;D-Dr. Terrace, please come to the front
	again, thank you!&quot;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Is
	he willing to be honest for once?&rdquo; Peach cut in, emboldened by
	Mario. &ldquo;Because so far I am wholly unsatisfied with your care,
	organization, husbandry, and communication!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ahh,
	well that&rsquo;s too bad,&rdquo; the whomp, Dr. Terrace, said
	behind their backs. &ldquo;Nass, you knew better to rope me back up
	here. This lady don&rsquo;t own the place anymore as of the big vote
	this morning. Just kick her out.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	pulled the rock baddie closer by the stereoscope. &ldquo;Sure you
	wanna try???&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Watch
	it, freak!&rdquo; Bowser exclaimed, followed by a thud.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He was
	flat on his spiked back, bowled over by a yellow blur that was
	barreling inside and zoning on the front desk. Mario dropped Dr.
	Terrace and scooped Peach into his arms, launching them both out of
	the way just in time. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The dust
	cloud settled- &quot;Dis is Jimmy M. of the Mushroom Kingdom Disease
	Control Unit!&quot; announced a short monty mole in a bright yellow
	hazmat suit. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Nass
	peeked over her desk, familiar with the agent&rsquo;s round furry
	face. &quot;There must be some mistake, James. We were expecting-
	No, you cannot- Stop! You are not authorized to-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">James had
	the temerity to jump into her office and the file cabinet next to
	her computer, sending papers flying around. As Mario was helping
	Peach to her feet, both dazed at whatever just happened, they heard
	tinny chatter from a radio.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	got somethin,&quot; James said into a walkie talkie, choice
	documents spread on Nass&rsquo;s desk before him.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No!&rdquo;
	Nass repeated, sliding her crooked glasses back up. She drop to her
	knees attempting to retrieve her data files spread about the marble
	floors. &ldquo;Terrace, someone help me!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Do
	I look like I can bend ninety degrees? Ha! Guess again!&rdquo; Dr.
	Terrace shrugged, standing amongst her papers. &ldquo;Be useful,
	will ya?&rdquo; He nudged the shy guy nurse &lsquo;Azul&rsquo;
	rolling up in a food cart. The younger nurse flashed a rude gesture
	but obeyed, albeit begrudgingly, picking up a pink slip that Peach
	suddenly identified. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Young
	man. May I see?&rdquo; she asked him, before boldly snatching it out
	of his hands anyway and retreating to the safety of Mario. The
	document James had plucked was procedure guideline for &lsquo;T-Virus&rsquo;,
	the unofficial name coined for the disease. Strikingly there was a
	pencil mark &lsquo;X&rsquo; over the entire list of recommended
	steps. She nearly lost her balance, and not just because one of her
	heels had broken a second ago.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	quickly steadied her as she was on the verge of tears. &ldquo;Peach,
	I think these jerks are sabotaging your hospital!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Then the
	alarms everywhere totally silenced and the red lights became
	neutral, eerie silence punctuating his revelation. A somewhat strung
	out Dr. Prof. Koopa made his entrance into the lobby, clothes and
	lab coat mysteriously ruffled. As he strolled towards Mario and
	Peach they subconsciously backed up until they were pinned against
	the automatic front doors.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">My
	Dear &lsquo;Sweat Pea&rsquo;,&rdquo; he began petulantly, &ldquo;I
	must inform you that the rumors are true. You are no longer the
	director here. Now, I have made it clear that we are handling this
	case so I suggest that you do not chide my staff or interfere with
	our new methods.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Wait
	a minute. Who the heck is in charge?&rdquo; Bowser demanded.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Prof.
	turned to the Koopa King, pausing with an air of recognition. &ldquo;That
	would be I, dear old Bowser..&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Great!
	Just needed the owner present according to protocol. Get on in here
	boys!&rdquo; James said into his receiver. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">This
	prompted a mega goomba, a koopa paratroopa, and a wiggler to rush in
	from outside, stepping around Mario, Peach, and Bowser. They split
	up and went down all of the halls, shaking the entire building in
	moments, banging down doors. Every nurse and patient that could was
	shoved outside during their emergency. They were soon swarmed by a
	stampede of folks and ejected on the grey asphalt of the parking
	lot. Mario woozily leaned up. Countless others were displaced,
	blocking his view partially of the huge vibrant 'MKDCU' truck parked
	in front of the entrance. On autopilot he was trying to rush back in
	when he caught sight of some of the health inspectors wheeling
	patients out. There was a yoshi, a koopa, then a toad- Toad Toad,
	and a girl- Daisy!<br/>
&quot;Waaaait!&quot; Mario shouted as the
	snifit driving the truck shifted into gear. The MKDCU sped off into
	the distance with his friends. Panting, he slung his hat to the
	ground. Then there was another layer to this catastrophe. His Mach
	Bike appeared to have been stolen from the park lot, leaving an oil
	puddle only. </font>
	</p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Four
	people regrouped at Club 64, a landmark diner in Toad Town known for
	its cozy atmosphere over the decades, a notable distinguisher
	against sleeker and larger competitors like Club Gamecube across the
	street. Mario got his friends a seat far in the back of the
	restaurant, near the often therapeutic fish tank. He kept her arm
	around the princess's quivering form, the tears that once marred her
	face long dried. The spinning ceiling fans and the bubbling of the
	tanks projecting blue light on them were the only sound. Yoshi's
	attention remained on the bulky old television screens usually set
	to closed caption only, no reports pertaining to them found among
	the mix of miscellaneous news&hellip;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;That
	Bowser&hellip;&quot; Luigi spat all a sudden.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	swiveled his chair around and nodded.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	implications were clear and with some guilt, Mario faced the
	princess. &quot;Nobody knew about Bowser until those alarms I
	thought, and the hospital was acting crazy WAY before then. There is
	just no way!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Don't
	be so certain..&quot; Peach answered. &quot;When we were searching
	for answers I couldn't help but feel that some of the unconscious
	patients were familiar. They were. They were sitting near me during
	the tennis game drinking that soda!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	eyed the princess sympathetically before returning to Mario. &quot;We
	know the source of the disease is the tennis game. It was a mixed
	crowd yet is a single koopa scum on the mends? No, only people like
	us, coincidentally the only partakers of that soda. It's a targeted
	attack, Mario! Of course we all disagree with the scummy hospital's
	ways, and this does not explain why they're not treating our
	friends, but I can't think of any other reason why they would kick
	the princess off the board like that except for permitting our worst
	enemy Bowser to stick around. &quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	remained silent. Yoshi seemed so logical as usual, and the rousing
	conviction in his voice, the way he pieced it all together with
	proficiency.. He'd successfully thrown Bowser under the bus, not a
	Mushroom Bus however as they had suddenly ceased to run in the last
	hour, but he was six feet below regardless and Mario didn't know how
	to dig him out. -Or if he should.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	checked a message. &quot;Oh Boo got my text to meet here. Good cause
	they know how to get into some of the private chat rooms on the Toad
	Town message boards. They have some 'juicy' info on Bowser.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	sprang up from his seat. &quot;Lemme go to the bathroom real quick.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	slipped out a back door, rounding the block on the lookout. He
	craned his neck upwards occasionally, pacing back and forth in the
	shaded alley next to Club 64. When he spotted at last a Clown Copter
	in the sky, he was anxious, so much he was shaking. Somewhat ashamed
	of that emotion, it quickly morphed into rage.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Bowser,
	because you can't ever be patient for five seconds now everyone is
	freaking out thinking about conspiracy theories and!!!..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	yawned under Mario's rant, his parked clown car barely squeezing in
	the alley. &quot;Done, Mario? What they're blabbering about is
	wrong! It's the hospital that's dirty, I had a lil toad fangirl rat
	on 'em to me. I was think'n at first maybe those losers staged their
	own fallout so that they could force a reschedule- Let me finish! -
	but I threw that out when I saw em. I bet not treating them is some
	experiment from that Dr. Professor creep runnin the place,
	slithering back to his old ways!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	slowly fizzled out. &quot;Huh?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Way
	back the dude was a mad scientist with me. You don't walk back form
	that.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;People
	don't change?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Bleh.&quot;
	He prepared to get back into his clown car. &quot;We can talk about
	that on the phone. Ya know, the only thing you like now.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hold
	on!&quot; Mario rolled his eyes. &quot;Eldstar, you're annoying. But
	to clear it up: You have nothing to do with anything, right? Nothing
	involving sodas? Nothing with your soldiers?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Of
	course not!&quot; he explained vehemently.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	believe you, but I'll be the only one in the entire Kingdom who
	does- aside from your fangirl I guess. Problem is every new piece of
	evidence rounds back to you, Bowser. I guess what I'm saying is..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	stepped closer, his red eyes flashing with intrigue. &quot;Spit it
	out!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
	don't want to just read about how we solved this mystery in the
	paper instead of doing something about it, right? ..Besides it's
	kind of neat seeing you.. Here. In town for once. &quot; He detected
	a smile creeping onto his rival and consequently himself. &quot;If
	they're the bad guys , what if we return to the hospital and teach
	them a lesson? I'll plan it out and in the meantime I know somewhere
	you can stay where no angry mobs would </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">ever</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">
	look.&quot; He presented his house keys from his pocket.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser's
	demeanor lit up like he was in a steakhouse. &quot;I finally get to
	see your old shack in person? This IS a Boo Moon!&quot; he said, a
	Darklandian calendar period where inhibitions were vanquished. &quot;By
	the way&hellip;been meaning to say.. Is 'Moustache' gonna be a name
	I can use anymore or something else?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;What
	are you talking about?&quot; Mario laughed. &quot;I need to not
	scare them into thinking I fell into the toilet. Again. Don't let
	anyone or anything see you, or break anything, or order too much
	pay-per-view, or break the TV when you can't beat my high scores&hellip;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His keys
	clank softly as they fell into the calloused open palm of his
	nemesis. That sealed it in his mind. He'd made a mistake, and
	worryingly he didn't want to turn back!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">When
	Mario snuck back into Club 64, he learned that the message boards
	predictably pinned the epidemic on the Koopa Troop. Boo looked
	nervous and uncomfortable about that 'juicy' detail on Bowser and
	wouldn't share it, even after Luigi and Yoshi plead.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No
	matter, Mario knew what he wanted to do next, but it wouldn't be
	easy. Not with his friend's unanimous next plan of action.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	Koopa made it back to the Mushroom Press and returned to her
	cubicle, tossing her notebook on her desk and dropping Mario&rsquo;s
	heavy bag in her chair as she checked her task organizer. Across
	from her space, Mitch&rsquo;s area was vacant and his items
	unguarded she noticed. Aware of his obsessive compulsive tendencies
	this concerned the reporter, more so when she found his lunch box
	under his table with uneaten sandwiches in it.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Jessie,
	have ya heard from that ol' Mitch since this afternoon? Just
	curious.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The desk
	lady shook her head so Kylie returned to her space, trying to reign
	in her erratic mind. Before she had that unexplained episode back at
	the stadium, she had enough wit to take photos. At the bottom of
	Toad and Daisy&rsquo;s trash was a can. Fungus Up! She just needed a
	way to prove a person shown drinking one is also checked into the
	hospital and vola! She didn&rsquo;t like the pattern. Bowser bad
	guys were there, Bowser was in the city, Bowser was </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">still</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">
	in the city.. This wasn&rsquo;t her first rodeo.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
	roadblock was that MK East ignored her calls. She could not skip on
	over right away because for some reason the buses suspended all
	routes due to an ongoing investigation. That would be a scoop for
	some other reporter. Anyway she still had Mario&rsquo;s bag picked
	from the scene of the crime. Her hand rested on her chin. The
	Kingdom&rsquo;s hero shared a locker room with the Koopa King, could
	there be a clue within? But then again, she couldn&rsquo;t bring
	herself to snoop on their greatest hero out of respect. Anyone else
	was fair game though..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She left
	a voicemail for Mario, then went back to blowing up MK East&rsquo;s
	lines. Office phone pressed against her ear, she overheard someone
	entering the press for a paper.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Right
	here, sir,&quot; Jessie said. Kylie rolled her computer chair back
	slightly so she could see the customer, a noki in a Hawaiian shirt
	and black sunglasses scan the newspaper nearly as tall as him and
	nod his head.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;See
	your stories?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The noki
	rolled it up under his arm and handed over coins to Jessie. &quot;Merci.&quot;
	He waltzed out and through the windows she saw him get into an Aston
	Mushroom sports car, a fancy 'thang' as she'd put it, at a parking
	meter. The Toad Town license plate didn't fool her. She clocked him
	as a tourist.</font></p>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	heard a snap as the bouncy beige colored couch's legs broke beneath
	him. Idly switching through pay-per-view, the Koopa King had to
	admit this was unanticipated, no not that, rather the state of the
	Mario brother's house. Gift boxes labeled 'Mario' lined the walls in
	high wobbly stacks, resembling a storage area instead of a living
	space. D&eacute;cor was mostly absent, with unsightly recreational
	items taking its place, video games, a weight set, etc.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	wondered how the younger brother was allowing such an inelegant
	home. He always got a neat freak vibe from Luigi, but then again..
	Anyway, Mario letting him stay here was more calculated than he'd
	realized at the time. The plumber knew Bowser's bulky shell would
	prohibit him from getting anywhere beyond this point, like to the
	bedrooms. Not that he was curious or anything. Whenever they met up
	again Mario would probably play good cop while he delivered the beat
	downs at the hospital. There would certainly be a brawl. He caught a
	number of those doctors trying to suppress their Darklandian
	accents.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">When the
	doorbell rang, he checked through the peephole.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Sup.
	Sorry this is late, bro. Also it's old but whatever. Here ya go.&quot;
	It was a paperboy squinting as he looked all around, his bike
	farther back on the curve. &quot;Hey, you home?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Grrrrr...&quot;
	Bowser leaned against the frame, thinking it over. &quot;-Oh hello,&quot;
	he answered, opening the door a hair and trying to lighten his
	voice. &quot;I'm.. a maid. (What? No. Wrong word, dumbo.) I mean
	housekeeper, heh heh. Mario's not in! Just leave it there.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The dark
	boo in an orange ball cap tilted down dropped the paper in a jumpy
	fashion. This suburb's quaint picture perfect houses had that
	goody-two-shoes thing going on, like out of a princess-approved real
	estate magazine.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh
	right. Here's the dough!&quot; Bowser flicked some gold coins out
	the door, hearing them bounce everywhere.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;...For
	real bro? One day Imma be a CEO. You'll regret that!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	sighed heavily.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yeah,
	I'm talking to you!&quot; The paperboy swung the door wide open
	before Bowser could react. In the stand off they both got a better
	look at each other and knew they'd made a mistake.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Get
	in!&quot; Bowser growled, snatching the dark boo inside and closing
	up the door before neighbors could see, and pressed him against the
	wall. &quot;What's yer name again?!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Y-yah,
	uh&hellip; Z, sir,&quot; he stammered.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Say
	the Mushroomcratic oath!...Gotcha! You're.. Huh? Are you my soldier
	or not? You said both versions.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The dark
	boo relaxed. Bowser could see no light reflecting back from his dark
	glassy eyes, sorta eerily. &quot;I'm a temp for you, boss. Had to
	switch stuff up, like you.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	stepped back, feeling exposed all a sudden. &quot;What? Me?? No!!
	And what makes you think you can?!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;What
	makes you think I can't? It's like this 'Boss', you're lukewarm. </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	know things like this. </font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
	should try being full on liberal and gay like I do. Then you'll get
	what you want in life. See ya, haha. You got me monologuing.&quot; Z
	dashed out, phasing through the door. &quot;I'll just be, ya know,
	covering my tracks. With less talking!!!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Confused
	out of his mind, Bowser watched the 'paperboy' or mook or whatever
	he was with that fake name leave on that oil leaky red painted Mach
	Bike.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wait a
	minute. Oh, never mind, he backtracked as one of his sons picked up
	the gosh darn phone finally. That weirdo was... but he was right. He
	had to get out there and do something! </font>
	</p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	scanned the dreary faces of Peach, Yoshi, his brother, and Booigi as
	they stood before or sat on the bench outside of Club 64.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	raised a fist. &quot;Mario, together we could pummel that old man. I
	could even take him alone if we squared off, and you know I'm no
	spring huffin' puffin..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	seemed to be holding his breath. Booigi quietly listened, watching
	whoever was speaking- Unless it was Mario.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach's
	thin eyebrows furrowed, seated moodily. &quot;It should not have to
	come to violence, but I admit I'm losing respect for everyone there.
	No I will not grovel for my position back. It's not about that
	anymore Mario! I can just build another hospital. It's about the
	patients, it's about Mr. Toad and Daisy, and we must do something
	about their schemes.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;So
	we agree on the sabotage angle, not Bowser.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yes
	Bowser!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;They
	aren't contradictory,&quot; Yoshi tacked on. &quot;Where's the last
	sighting?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Booigi
	checked their phone. &quot;No more KT since.. Somewhere near
	Pleasant Path.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	remarked, &quot;Where we live??&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario bit
	his tongue so much he could taste metallic traces.. &quot;Here's the
	plan. I need somebody to get my duffle bag from this reporter, Kylie
	Koopa at the newspaper press. She left a voicemail. It has my
	deodorant in it!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;That's
	not an emergency is it?&quot; Peach asked.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He seated
	and reassuringly held her. &quot;Well, we have to be careful.
	Shouldn't we confront them AFTER they find out where Toad and Daisy
	were taken?-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	gave a start. &quot;-You didn't tell us that, Mario! That kinda
	changes everything!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;My
	bad! 'MKDCU' can be researched from your castle, Peach. You have
	been gone since this morning, now aren't your toads worried? They
	need to see your pretty face to know you're okay. Once we've settled
	that, then we talk bashing skulls together.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
	remained unhappy looking, though her blush hinted otherwise. &quot;All
	right Mario! Gosh..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	thought for a moment, checking his camera. &quot;Fine fine fine.
	I'll get your bag.&quot; He stretched his legs, preparing for the
	walk. As anticipated, no one offered to call a ride.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Several
	minutes and blocks away, Luigi and companion Booigi were still
	winding around town under the beating heat. He'd never missed their
	motorbike so much until now. The pavement was melting his boots and
	foot traffic was thick enough for there to be traffic jams at some
	spots, in front of item shops, or restaurants he'd never bothered to
	visit, or games stores, some with headlines tacked on to the window
	fronts. Booigi loitered in front of &quot;Tennis game of Terror&quot;,
	and then sped forward to catch back up, tugging on the green
	plumber.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Weegee,
	hold on! I have to show you something. It's sensitive I guess.&quot;
	Booigi slipped inside the empty Toad Town cleaners and Luigi
	followed. &quot;So... Check your phone.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">When
	clicking the link, Luigi's heart stopped. Courtesy of an anonymous
	message boards user with a simple yet enigmatic caption of 'lol it's
	like fanfiction or something', a photo showed Mario and Bowser
	walking on the sidewalks casually holding hands. Mario appeared
	henpecked yet content while Bowser had a face of glee he'd never
	seen before, captured today very close to the hospital. With his
	keen eyes there were no traces of editing, manipulation, or any
	other photo trickery.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	kept his nose down at the bright screen, eyes shut and watery. The
	only sounds were the low whirl of the washing machines.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Booigi
	inched closer. &quot;Sorry.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Don't
	be. Toad and I were.. reluctantly in on it I g-guess. Mario became a
	squeaky wheel to Peach about introducing a Peace Pact for a reason
	including, but not limited to ceasing princess kidnapping
	adventures. This sucks.&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Luigi,
	I don't know what to say..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
	couldn't.&quot; Luigi folded his arms, sniffling, letting the tears
	roll off. &quot;People in this world don't realize that a 'Mario'
	was created to be the champion of the Mushroom Kingdom. Ripping that
	purpose away, well intentioned or not, made him go haywire. Let's
	go.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">?Boo
	swiveled as he marched out. &quot;Huh?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Let's
	go.&quot;</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	plopped down in between Peach and Yoshi as Peach was making a call.
	By her light casual tone it had to be a distaff subordinate. Or the
	only. Well, toads were technically.. Eh, anyway Toadette rose to the
	rank of personal assistant recently. Peach scooped her up straight
	after college, and would have sooner if the toad girl wanted. Next
	he knew, Peach was eyeing him covertly. He checked with Yoshi who
	winked in return.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	princess caught herself. &quot;Oh nothing.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario saw
	his reflection in the windows of the building across the street from
	them, Club Gamecube. Forgetting to shave this morning, his finely
	trimmed facial hair style was accompanied by thick black stubble
	heavily spotting his chin and cheeks. Why didn't anyone say
	something? Soon a fancy pink Birthday Girl kart picked them up.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Should
	we post a wanted ad for your bike?&quot; Yoshi asked.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	drummed his fingers on the leathery armrest. &quot;I almost feel
	like that would ensure I never see it again. You know how my fans
	are...&quot; he trailed off as he noticed they were taking a detour.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
	made a stop at a northern cultured market not far from Royal
	Raceway. Mario empirically knew that If Toadette wasn't there Peach
	would conveniently snag fresh whatever from any common merchant on
	the street and they'd be none the wiser at the castle. Yoshi read
	the descriptions of mundane produce inscribed in old Shroomish,
	though he'd evidently learned via a book, so the pronunciation was
	butchered in spots. Still, he made it thoroughly known that he
	wasn't too old a dino to learn new tricks.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach's
	Castle had banners in support of Toad winning the tennis game hung
	high, beyond even what a ladder would reach. With that sobering
	reminder of their predicament, Mario couldn't wait to storm that
	hospital with Bowser and- he took this one step at a time..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Too
	many of you are speaking. Where did it start?&quot; Mario asked the
	toads standing around. Another road block, they stepped into a front
	room filled with ankle high water. Others in the background were
	dragging water logged furniture from the inner rooms to the dry
	mezzanine.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;The
	kitchen. The basement. Upstairs. Outside. Inside,&quot; they all
	answered at once.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Enough
	excuses!&quot; grumbled Toadsworth at the top of the red carpeted
	staircase. The older brown spotted mushroom man shuffled down each
	step, walking stick in tote. The other toads tensed up or pretended
	to be aloof. He slid up his glasses one more time upon reaching the
	bottom, with a little start. &quot;-Master Mario! I did not know you
	were arriving so soon to help us with this predicament. The pipe
	downstairs burst today. My Princess,&quot; he added gravely. &quot;Your
	castle has been in a deluge for hours now. We were trying to handle
	the matter, for we knew you were dealing with other ordeals.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yeah,
	like the tennis game and the bus driver murderer on the loose!&quot;
	a blue toad added.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadsworth
	directed his glare his way. &quot;Bucken-Berry, the latter is only
	hearsay at this time!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh,
	stars help us,&quot; Peach mumbled, slumping somewhat.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	wrapped an arm around her. &quot;I got it, remember? Just look up
	that MKDCU.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He gave
	her a quick peck on the cheek. Some of the toads watching cooed and
	Peach herself flushed bright red. As Mario left her side to tread
	downstairs, she felt flustered. While inseparable, they weren't
	together together, and mutually confirmed that, yet he repeatedly
	and successfully did things like that to crowd out other
	reservations. Thousands of coins worth of damage was happening
	before her eyes, their friends were in peril, and no matter how much
	his bravado was especially attractive today, that didn't change it.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Batting
	distracting feelings aside, she brought Yoshi higher into the castle
	and through corridors where it was quiet and undamaged.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Mario's
	great, isn't he?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Then he
	had to say that. Yes, the fade style he sported with his dark hair
	instead of that old comb over. Then his stubble, and the was his
	biceps were getting large enough to stretch the fabric of his red
	long sleeve shirt...</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">But Yoshi
	probably wasn't going for that angle. A simple, 'He is, Yoshi,&quot;
	sufficed.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Along the
	way, Yoshi's eyes glossed familiar artwork until the nature prints.
	He favored the sunset at Dinosaur Land's Vanilla Dome. Leaning in,
	the photo credit was 'Luigi Mario'..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	castle's library, tucked away down a lonely section, was unlike any
	other room in the castle. Always unoccupied and books consisted
	mostly of antique children's story tales or dry historical
	documents. Creepy wasn't the word the dinosaur would use, more like
	neglected, everything organized yet covered in a thin layer of dust.
	The only standout was a desk that consisted of the 'computer lab'
	with out of place looking desktop.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He took a
	seat beside her, lightening the mood. &quot;Here's another reason I
	need to convince Birdo to move with me down here. Computers cost a
	billion dragon coins on the island, yet each of your toads had one
	in their back pocket. If she doesn't budge again, this might do it.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That was
	a little surprising to hear. She thought there were calm waters over
	there. &quot;I'm sure it will.&quot; She clicked on some sort of
	search box on the screen and pulled up a page on the Mushroom
	Kingdom Disease Control Unit.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ran by
	James Monty and 'Parabilly Koopa' a co-founder, with additional
	agents 'Richard G.', 'Wiggletron B.', and 'Sebastian B.' , they were
	strictly commission based health inspectors. The snifit, Sebastian
	Bullet, seemed familiar. Maybe he was a friend of one of her toads
	in the past. Or not. Their office was stationed outside of Toad Town
	city limits, but the affiliate drop off was that crazed Dr.
	Toadley's clinic..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	jolted when Yoshi touched her shoulder, losing herself in thought
	for a while. &quot;Oh my!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-No,
	I'm sorry, Princess. Let's update Mario. Are you alright? Come on.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	nodded to the dinosaur. Silently she pleaded to the stars that a
	clear path revealed itself soon. Her intuition told her that this
	web of misunderstandings, terrible coincidences, and strange
	decisions were darker than imagined.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-For
	instance, this one's outta date, Steve! Just muddling the case!&quot;
	Kylie Koopa ripped a paper from the wall mounted cork board and
	crumpled it in her hands.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;My
	mistake, doll. Lost my reading glasses yesterday. Jessie, c'mere.
	You verify new submissions for now. Rest of ya, if the police tells
	us of another homicide, we're gonna hafta tell somebody inclined to
	do somethin'. Like Mario.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The green
	plumber lingered at the Mushroom Press's front door when Steve, a
	bullet bill with a graying mustache, removed another slew of false
	clues down from the board. Other reporters were standing with him
	eagerly pacing, waiting, or reading clues. Jessie the receptionist,
	a red headed human in a blue dress suit, hid her face further with a
	newspaper. Another co-worker, a Big Bertha, glanced at her and
	consolingly patted her back with a fin. Kylie was discretely
	noticing that when she caught the guests at the door. She motioned
	towards her office.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi and
	Booigi followed, both fearing what they'd stepped into. &quot;I see
	it's busy here. We'll get my brother's stuff and my memory card and
	skedaddle.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	with a sigh collapsed into her chair. &quot;I do think the soda is
	the key. Good tip, fella. I got through to the hospital finally and
	hounded 'em until the receptionist admitted that the patients are
	who you have on film with it.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No
	doubt a Bowser scum setup...&quot; He almost never disparaged the
	mooks Bowser roped into his party out loud. Now it was flowing like
	the bitter waves of agitation within him. &quot;Erm, so Toad and
	Daisy were taken by the MKDCU, Kylie. Heard of them?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	paused, clearly weighed by something. &quot;Mitch might, but he's
	still missing. Besides that problem, we're trying to solve
	homicides.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Booigi
	gave a start. &quot;Ms. Kylie?!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
	heard me, lil buddy. Within the last hour or two somebody's killing
	folks around town. Murder method's so distinct we're pretty sure
	this 'Phantom' as we're calling them began the spree with the
	Mushroom bus driver.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi's
	stomach churned. &quot;We hadn't heard..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Give
	it till evening news. They're unidentified 'enemy species', hate to
	use that term, with weird stamps on their appendages. I'm just
	afraid.. You know darn well some folk will stick their nose up and
	say good riddance!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	loathed that slip up even more. The Koopa King was the crux of their
	Kingdom's issues, not his Troop. He pined for them to have a decent
	life ever since Mr. Toad got him on that wavelength years ago.
	&quot;Eldstar help us.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Amen,&quot;
	she continued with her head low. &quot;There are some crime scene
	photos. You are a Mario brother so you might notice stuff we didn't
	if you wanna take a peek&hellip;&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi was
	caught off guard for a second. &quot;-Yes. I-I'd better.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Excuse
	me.&quot; Booigi backed out of the cubical before corpses were
	visible. They briefly caught Jessie spying from down the hallway.
	The woman withdrew.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Finding
	that strange, the boo followed stealthy. In a back area Jessie
	finished guzzling down fountain water and spun around.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-O-oh,
	I didn't mean to- You are Mr. Luigi's sidekick, correct?&quot; She
	clasped her hands behind her back, hazel eyes darting to the floor,
	ankles pressed side to side. &quot;I was just seeing how Ms. Kylie
	was fairing. Such a workaholic. Heh.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The boo
	wasn't used to people being more afraid of them than they were of
	the other person. They asked extra nice, &quot;Oh. Okay. Umm. How
	well do you know Mr. Mitch?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;He's
	great! ..His work. He writes Mushroom Enquirer. Big time guy.
	Wouldn't normally be out of office at this time. And his phone- &quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Wait,
	you have his personal cell?-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;...
	Okay I give up! Please don't sic Luigi on me! On my break I heard
	some gossip at the bus stop that was out. Then I recalled that Mitch
	said he might go missing after he took care of something. He wants a
	parcel delivered to him, but I don't know where that is or if he's
	alive. They were talking about this 'crushed' black car and a
	crowbar being needed to pry a guy out.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;..The
	office doesn't know..?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No,
	no.&quot; She shook her head. &quot;His work is volatile, just ask
	Kylie. They have history. Actually don't, please! I'm only the desk
	girl and if I get wrapped up in what he's into-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh..
	Thank you, Miss. Can I.. tell Luigi? You won't get in trouble, I
	promise. He's not like that.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;O-okay.
	Just him.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;S-sure.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The shaky
	duo split, Boo totally understanding freezing up because of unasked
	for burdens.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Meanwhile,
	Luigi revealed to the reporters the little gems they'd overlooked
	regarding the victims. He drew from two sets of photos for each
	body, no one able to definitely prove which was taken first. One set
	was donated by Chief Inspector Douglas, a Snifit Patrol partner,
	grainy from an older camera (thanking his new skills), but
	proficiently done, and the other set courtesy of the new
	photographer Susie Que, in HD resolution but not framed property,
	also bodies in slightly shifted positions. The discrepancy was that
	Susie's tended to obscure the marking Luigi identified as Koopa
	Troop tattoos. Odd, like how all bodies were all found near places
	seeking extra hired help.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	afterwards, carefully considered Booigi's discreet lead on the toad
	who was considered their best reporter. Remembering Mitch's
	antagonistic past, why should they mind that matter, and behind
	Kylie's back. Then, the possibility hit him. What if he knew about
	this tennis disaster, and that's why he'd vanished?</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After
	handling the two minute repair job with ease, Mario exchanged his
	waterlogged boots for a spare pair. He wondered if Peach had
	replaced her soggy high heels. The ideal of her prancing around in
	pastel fuzzy slippers entertained him while he laced the boots up
	and tucked his pant legs in. Climbing up from the basement he
	expected the soaking wet main room to be clear. Instead, Toadsworth
	stood in the door frame looking out, as if a guard. He was once a
	soldier, most wouldn't believe, but this was a new habit..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Master
	Mario! Yes, come here for a moment, if you would be so kind.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	jumped. &quot;-Oh. Sure.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;We
	appreciate your selfless efforts as usual. You are a paragon
	Mushroom citizen, but I must caution you on a matter.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	kept listening apprehensively. &quot;...Mmhm?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The old
	mushroom cast him an impish glance. &quot;Just pulling your leg, old
	sport! I say, will you grow that out? Or is that 'grizzled 90s
	action hero' style what you are going for, Master Mario?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	took that in and then laughed. By tomorrow, he might have a beard.
	&quot;Ah&hellip; not sure yet,&quot; he answered honestly. &quot;Hey,
	I just gotta run real quick and get something. Keep everyone away
	from the wet areas till I'm back.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">While he
	was working in the basement he texted Bowser to prepare to meet him.
	He checked his watch, cleared out the stopwatch he forgot to before,
	and broke into a sprint. As he was tearing down the castle's green
	front yard he heard hushed voices. Over to the side Peach had a mini
	bridge with a shallow stream underneath. Bending his head under, he
	found two young toads.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
	stepped away from Bucken-Berry, waving and flushing. &quot;We
	totally weren't goofing off or anything, hehe!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;What's
	up?&quot; the blue toad went, far more naturally. &quot;Mario, I
	need to tell you-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Don't
	bright that up now,&quot; She tugged on his dark blue vest.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The blue
	toad pulled it back onto his shoulders. &quot;Sorry baby, I gotta.
	Not being funny with Mr. Toad in the hospital, but if it has to do
	with Bowser Freaks it makes sense. He has connections with bad guys
	ya know.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Diplomatically.
	Would you apply that to Princess Daisy too?&quot; she fired back.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	shrugged. &quot;I mean, we don't know her like that. Maybe. That'd
	be Daisy's perigynous. She has no Koopa Troop history-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Prerogative?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;That.
	-Unlike Mr. Toad, who knows all about Princess Mush IV in 444 AD,
	having a secret relationship with a koopa prince and starting a huge
	bloody war.&quot; He teased her with a smirk. &quot;See, I do pay
	attention in history class like you're always moaning about!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	rolled her eyes. &quot;Try the rest of them sometime, Blue.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	backed up slowly. &quot;Thanks for the heads up, Cool Blue. Lots to
	consider, ha ha. Talk to you later.&quot; He loosened up the collar
	around his neck. &quot;...Eldstar&hellip;&quot; he mumbled a
	distance away, off of castle grounds.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">When he
	made it to the city, he was drawing close to Snifit Patrol's
	station. Painted silver, it used to be a fast food joint. A whomp
	officer, Sergeant Howie, leaned idly out the drive through window.
	The garage was empty, the others likely patrolling. Mario diverted
	to another block. There was an unwritten rule that none of the
	Mushroom Kingdom vigilantes stepped on each other's toes, influenced
	somewhat by how distrustful the princess was of those other guys.
	Too bad, Mario thought as he came upon MK Hospital East. In some
	alternate universe he would have loved to be part of a team even
	bigger than his brother and maybe a blue and yellow toad&hellip;</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Following
	the unwelcome MKDCU intrusion, Mushroom Kingdom Hospital struggled
	to recover rather blatantly. The automatic door was permanently
	stuck open and leaves and dust from outside piled up. Doctor
	Professor Koopa, after attrition, invited a janitor from their
	sister hospital in Southern Mushroom Kingdom to assist.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Nass T.
	returned to her desk, freshened up. A minute in, she was glued to
	the clock already. Combing her long black hair down, she was
	convinced she appeared sound, aside from the discolored oblong
	bruise on her wrist. For one call-in her brevity failed her and now
	that injury was her penalty.. She drearily reflected on how it got
	to this. She connected with 'Theodore' over some shared experience
	in royal medical service. She would later find out some of his was
	from the OTHER side. Now here came that help..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Howdy,
	Mr. Probabilly Koopa here,&quot; greeted a mature koopa paratroopa
	in a blue janitor outfit. A gray pony tail reached his winged shell.
	Unceremoniously he began tidying up the debris without further
	instructions.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Meanwhile,
	Mario climbed into room 444, predicting they wouldn't notice the
	missing window pane. He couldn't locate Bowser anywhere, even
	peeking down the halls. Then he thought he heard commotion up front.
	When he marched there however, the disturbance involved someone else
	near and dear.. Luigi moments ago slipped up on the wet floor and
	knocked down a stand of traveling pamphlets and ads. As the janitor
	was helping his brother and apologizing repeatedly, Mario felt a
	wave of nausea, unable to move his feet. Nass's hand hovered over
	the intercom, but then she simply ducked under her desk. Probabilly
	laid down a wet floor sign and gestured for the brothers to scatter.
	The Marios dodged the approaching doctors, not saying a word until
	they hit a secluded alcove down the East hall.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Well,&quot;
	Mario squeaked. &quot;You first.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I'm
	trying to help with a murder case.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	whipped his way. &quot;..?!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-And
	you?...&quot; Luigi impetuously leaned towards his ear, venomously
	stating, &quot;You were gonna meet 'him' here again, weren't you,
	just like in your little photoshoot before?!&quot; He turned away.
	&quot;How can you live like this? Lying to all of us?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Living
	like this??&quot; Mario whispered, gently facing him around again.
	&quot;..I was dying inside for a long time brother. Yes, BEFORE the
	pact, okay? Believe me when I say that with all my heart, I think
	Bowser is innocent. We were supposed to meet here and bust this
	place, now we just need to scram. Will you come with me? I'll get
	into it more, I promise!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario's
	pleading eyes were rare. At this stage in their well established
	lives, Mario didn't really 'need' him like that. In exigent
	circumstances, hoards would help the hero. Of course he was his
	brother and a good person, so naturally he 'wanted' Luigi to be
	involved. This was different. He needed him to listen, and Luigi's
	well mortared defenses were cracking by the moment.</font></p>
	<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Take
	his word for now and get outta here!&rdquo; </font></em>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	checked over his shoulder.</font></p>
	<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Go
	to the Toadley Clinic. Tell him the disease is so and so..&rdquo;</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">
	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	reached out and stabilized him as he held his temples.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oww.
	Toadley Clinic. Oww my head!&rdquo; Luigi groaned.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario&rsquo;s
	attention snapped to a thin red line running down Luigi&rsquo;s left
	nostril. It was time to go&hellip;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Back up
	front, an older toad woman in a pink outfit, Mariam approached Nass
	after someone tipped her off. &ldquo;-And you saw those brutish
	Mario brothers? Girlfriend, report them as Dr. Prof said.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">N-no.
	I was mistaken!&rdquo; Nass replied. &ldquo;The wind blew that junk
	over, but while you cover my break you can call security if you
	insist. Not that &lsquo;fake&rsquo; MKDCU security like before&hellip;&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">As they
	spoke, the janitor leaned up from vigorous mopping he did near the
	seats. &quot;That 'splains it,&rdquo; he laughed to himself.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A few
	moments later, in walked a noki with sunglasses and a red Hawaiian
	shirt. He weaved around the wet floor signs and still drying bleach,
	even picking up one of the travel brochures Luigi knocked over along
	the way. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Visitation
	is suspended, dearie,&quot; Mariam informed him.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	understand,&rdquo; he replied, flashing his white teeth and holding
	up a pamphlet. &ldquo;Are there more of these somewhere? I am just a
	tourist.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;From
	somewhere exotic I see..&quot; she murmured mischievously. &quot;Ah
	hem. Down the hall to the left.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	shortly ignored magazine rack, a visitor's station rising to the
	ceiling, diverting as soon as he wasn't being watched. All he knew
	was that Agent N's niece, Ashley was somewhere. He scanned a
	directory of the room numbers.</font></p>
	<p><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Try
	room 26, Mr. Bond.&quot;</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">
	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The noki
	froze in his tracks, hands reaching to see if the inconspicuous ear
	plugs were in place.</font></p>
	<p><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;If
	you weren't so handsome, Jelectro, I'd call you stupid. You really

	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No
	one asked you!&quot; Jelectro said out loud by mistake. The
	detective covered his mouth.</font></p>
	<p><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Just
	get to my room already.&quot;</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">
	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The last
	thing he expected, the noki calmed himself and pressed on for Agent
	N's sake. He navigated to the room of a toad with a green cap, under
	covers resting. Bandages were all over his face and his monitors
	indicated a sluggish heart rate and strained breathing.</font></p>
	<p><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	know you but you don&rsquo;t know me,&quot; </font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">the
	toad communicated without looking, or moving his mouth. </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;But
	long story. Not just showing off. If I jabber they&rsquo;ll realize
	I ain&rsquo;t half dead. Did you like Sirena Beach, French boy?&quot;</font></em></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Trying to
	mask his jitters under a stony composure, Jelectro stood beside the
	bed. &quot;I am sorry something happened to you, but it does not
	appear you have the same medical problem as the others.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Uh,
	you think?? Got hit by a bus &lsquo;cause of the freak that has
	something to do with it though. Plus there&rsquo;s a conspiracy here
	but only Theodore knows some of the details and that wacko can keep
	me out of his head somehow.&quot;</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">
	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Who?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Doctor
	Professor Koopa. Just focus on the thug that works for Bowser-&rdquo;</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">
	Then his body stirred ever so slightly. </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&ldquo;Friggin..
	He&rsquo;s gettin close. It&rsquo;s a problem. His mind.. So
	fascinating. I&rsquo;d love to mentor him if he wasn&rsquo;t a

	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What

	</p>
	<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh

	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With a
	grunt as the info was hot wired to him, Jelectro felt like a Bowser
	bomb went off in his skull. He stumbled backwards and into a
	recliner in the room, knocking it over and then out into the
	hallway, disoriented by the cacophony of the thoughts around him
	until he remembered how to lower the volume mentally. Just in time,
	as splotches of red dripped onto the white tiles. He pressed a
	handkerchief to his nose. Quel Salaud! The toad was at an impressive
	level he didn't expect.. Heading out he found someone making a fuss
	at the service desk, the type Jelectro had knocked around a million
	times, a young punk.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No
	exception to the visitation restrictions I'm afraid,&quot; the nurse
	told the dark boo, forcing a smile.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Aww!
	But he's my favorite coworker!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I..
	thought you were just hired today? Dearie?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The dark
	boo snatched her lanyard, snarling, &quot;Listen 'bro', you're gonna
	tell me which room my 'pal' is in!!!!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yes..I..will..tell..you&hellip;&quot;
	she replied robotically.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jelectro
	dashed up. &quot;There you are, mon ami!&quot; He wedged himself
	between the dark boo and the nurse, severing their eye contact.
	&quot;Don't you recognize me.. 'Zoo Diddley'? Hm?&quot; The noki
	briskly flashed his Super Spy HQ badge so that only Zoo could see
	it, then he got amiable again. &quot;Mon ami, let us converse as we
	depart. Oui?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Blindsided,
	Zoo allowed himself to be dragged outside by the detective. Then
	like a switch went off on him, he dropped down and begged
	pathetically- &quot;Wait! The others broke the rules first! Boss
	would do the same if he found out.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jelectro
	tightened his grasp on the thug's stubby arm. &quot;Hm? Which
	'others', which 'boss'? You refer to your journalist gig or King
	Bowser?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;It's
	complicated, see..&quot; Zoo replied vaguely. &quot;Anyway I can
	always come back. Not like this guy's going anywhere soon, Bond.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hey!
	Don't you-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	phased through him and away, towards a motorbike parked illegally on
	the sidewalk. The detective slid his sunglasses up and gave chase,
	reaching for the anti-boo gas. More French cursing ensued, the
	canister empty. He just happened to have a fellow agent boo that he
	didn't particularly gel with..</font></p>

	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Princess,

	been additional homicides now!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The toads
	listening in behind closed doors recoiled, particularly Toadette.
	Yoshi had just reentered, needing to step outside to get a signal to
	call Birdo. Peach Castle was a dead zone for 4G, something about the
	concrete.. His fianc&eacute; was patient upon learning how things
	kept escalating, but he still detected frustration in her tone when
	he confirmed, carefully wording it, that he intended to stay the
	rest of the day. She&rsquo;d understand later. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-But
	Toadsworth dear, I saw where Mario fixed the problem with the pipes.
	He only needed tape so it should not take this long!&rdquo; The pink
	princess huffed. &ldquo;Toad and Daisy must be at the Toadley Clinic
	and- I&rsquo;m just trapped in my own home!!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Stars
	in heaven! So no hope of recovery soon? ..Do not give me that
	petulant look, Princess. I feared you were censoring yourself to
	spare us the most severe details. Well, do not do that!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	am sorry..&rdquo; she groused. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Regardless,
	I will allow it,&rdquo; he continued warmly. He rang a bell. &ldquo;All
	we need is a chauffeur for you, Princess. My sincere apologies,
	Master Yoshi, but there are regulations on who may transport our
	princess. Ah hem!... Yes, thank you Bucken-Berry, but alas you have
	not a license. Tut tut. Since you are present you may take down the
	banners for Mr. Toad however.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">About
	time,&rdquo; Buckenberry said, making Toadette who accompanied him
	give him a light slap. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mr.
	Toadsworth, I know I&rsquo;ve already been out today but may I take
	them again?&rdquo; she volunteered, seeming eager to distance.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Welcome,
	do you have an appointment?&quot; the receptionist asked right away,
	a younger toad woman with blonde medium length hair.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi and
	Mario approached the desk. The brothers nor Booigi spoke on the way
	there, which made the hitchhiking they did with a random fan of
	Mario&rsquo;s somewhat awkward. Booigi in particular felt a little
	bit of revulsion towards Mario. They just couldn&rsquo;t erase that
	sickening image of the hero and villain crossing the line. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-No
	we don&rsquo;t, but it&rsquo;s me, Mario. Tell him that,&rsquo;&quot;
	Mario spoke up.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	intern pressed a buzzer. &ldquo;Doctor, I&rsquo;m sending some in
	without an appointment. They&rsquo;re pretty important people, so..&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Am
	I ready? No I am not!&quot; A voice boomed from behind large double
	doors walling off the waiting area from the rest of the Toadley
	Clinic. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The three
	were permitted through and into Dr. Toadley&rsquo;s lab, a dimly lit
	larger room partitioned into two halves. One side had beds with five
	patents in them. The recognized Toad and Daisy spontaneously, tinted
	green as before, but also connected to proper looking equipment.
	Booigi remained over there. On the other side of the room was Dr.
	Toadley&rsquo;s shrine, library, and desk space all at once. The
	titular doctor dressed in purple was his table, surrounded by
	shelves of various herbs and powders.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Am
	I working day and night to find out what is wrong with my patients
	here? Yes I am. Reluctantly, can I answer anything else? Yes I can.&quot;
	Toadley asked impatiently. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	stepped forward. &quot;..Actually this isn&rsquo;t a question and I
	can&rsquo;t explain how I know this, but they have the.. Mushroom
	Flu.&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">When he
	said that the world seemed to stop, especially for Mario. &ldquo;..Luigi,
	they can&rsquo;t! That only ever broke out in Dark Land!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	know.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Brilliant!
	Did I suspect such? Yes I did!&rdquo; Dr. Toadley exclaimed,
	animated and less cantankerous as he jumped onto his laptop with
	research. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Over his
	mad clacking of keys, Mario heard someone sparing off with Mary.
	&ldquo;L-Luigi. Please see about that. I-I need to check something,&rdquo;
	Mario panicked, fiddling with his cellphone.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Numbly
	Luigi obeyed, unable to discern what implications Mario saw in that
	that he didn&rsquo;t. A dry bones was at the desk while Toadley&rsquo;s
	intern shielded herself with a clipboard. &ldquo;I said, no! We&rsquo;re
	not really hiring, Phil!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yo,
	but imma chemist. Got connections with Reggie J. business bro. He
	runs Fungus Up.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That&rsquo;s
	been discontinued. For years.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Fo
	real? I saw people drankin em though today.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That&rsquo;s
	enough. Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; Luigi said, forcibly escorting the
	baddie out onto the sidewalk. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Aww,
	man!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Shut
	up and go back to where you belong.&rdquo; He watched until the
	baddie was down the block.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	took in the fresh air, the scorching heat lessened by a haze in the
	sky. He was only broken out of his musings by the mirage-like sight
	of his Mach Bike pulling up in front of the clinic. Aside from a
	bunch of extra dirt and grime it was exactly like it, down to the &lsquo;I
	heart Sarasaland&rsquo; sticker on the back, the vanity Toad Town
	license plate that spelled &lsquo;644evar&rsquo; even though long
	outdated, and the oil leak Mario was supposed to fix last week. The
	stranger riding it shook his head like he&rsquo;d just missed
	someone he was trying to meet. With a pang of anxiety, Luigi clocked
	him as yet another Bowser mook- they really were everywhere, and of
	course one of them would be their bike thief! </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	firmly held onto the handlebar. It occurred to him that he actually
	had to speak now.. &quot;Hey. This belongs to my brother and I. Piss
	off and there's no trouble beyond this. Something else is taking
	precedent now.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Up close,
	this guy was around Booigi's age, maybe a tad younger. The plumber
	getting light headed, he hoped he wouldn't spar off. The dark boo
	was handsome, putatively sophisticated beyond the bikejacking part,
	but laced underneath.. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Really
	bro?..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Really.&quot;
	Luigi warned, shaking out of it. &quot;I'd skip town if I were you.
	Somebody out there's taking you guys out. No, It's not Mario and I.
	We'd never. (I hope).&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Eyeing
	him impressively, or at least Luigi thought it kind of looked like
	that, the dark boo abandoned the stolen property without protest.
	&quot;Tell my cuz in there I said hi,&quot; he remarked before
	vanishing.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After
	following around that bike until it went off road, through parks,
	and even through the Toad Town dump, Jelectro had to cease giving
	chase. If he irreparably damaged the car for the sake of a mission
	he wasn&rsquo;t sure he was going to accept yet, he&rsquo;d never
	hear the end of it at home.. He pursued the other part of his lead,
	returning to the Mushroom Press. Walking in, he had a foolproof idea
	on how to access the items of Mitch Jamerson Toad, &lsquo;Mushroom
	Enquirer&rsquo; author, aged forty-one, technically 'single', living
	in a complex around Pleasant Path.. He kept reciting those facts,
	just in case he was quizzed. He wouldn&rsquo;t need them. He
	strolled beyond Jessie at the front desk, patting her eyes
	repeatedly with tissues, no questions asked. Jelectro found the
	cubicle with the &lsquo;Mitch Toad&rsquo; gold plate. Before he
	could try the lock, a koopa blocked him.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What&rsquo;s
	up sir? This stuff over here&rsquo;s private, alright?&rdquo; Kylie
	told him, crossing her arms. &ldquo;And locked behind a password.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ah,
	but I am Mitch&rsquo;s intern, mon ami. He was involuntarily
	relocated and needs me to retrieve his items. If I may..&rdquo; He
	eased around her and she responded by not bulging.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No
	offense sir, but I know &lsquo;em a little too well to believe that.
	You only got this far because half the office went home early.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">On
	this busy day, madam?&rdquo; He effortlessly input Mitch&rsquo;s
	password, unlocking his cubicle space.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	started blankly at first and then rubbed the back of her neck
	tiredly. &ldquo;Okay so maybe you do work with that ol Mitch. Gee
	whiz!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Why
	is this building empty?&rdquo; Jelectro reiterated, locating a
	folder titled &lsquo;Stars&rsquo; and then &lsquo;Chimes&rsquo;.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Paranoid
	they&rsquo;ll be mistaken for a Bowser freak. Since you're an
	associate I guess, I can tell you that it&rsquo;s only Susie, Steve,
	Jessie, Betty and me sticking around. I can&rsquo;t drop the tennis
	game investigation going on.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Behind is
	dark sunglasses, the nokis beady eyes sparkled with interest.
	&ldquo;Perfect. The tennis game is my topic as well! I know what
	they are sick with.&rdquo; He revealed the answer under his breath.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	nearly flipped out of her shell. &ldquo;Get whatever ya need from
	&lsquo;em. We gotta tell the Princess!!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Eldstar,
	high above in his great and awe-inspiring temple, found it too
	insurmountable to leave. Yes. It had finally occurred. Simplify the
	layout his celestial companions begged. There's only us living here
	and a few star kids. Never! Star Temple had been sculped before the
	strands of time were woven by the Lord he appointed. How dare he
	alter it, even now with a haze settling in the upper chambers. If he
	only located the source, for there were many in space, the issue
	could be handled. He wandered continuously, even as the time passed
	for future appointments.</font></p>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The sharp
	ticks of the wall clock rattled Luigi's soul as he waited. However
	the conversation with Peach went as Mario hid in that storage room,
	it didn't bode well. Ear against the door, Luigi captured a few
	defensive responses on his brother's end, followed as quickly by an
	obsequious apology.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Let
	me talk to you,&quot; he said as Mario was leaving. He shut them
	back inside, leaving a sliver for light to bleed in. The dark square
	shaped room housed bird feed, a sack of potatoes, emergency bags of
	stardust, and a hair dryer to list some. &quot;Let's start again. I
	had contact with a reporter, Kylie because we suspected 'You Know
	Who'. I was only back at the hospital because another guy from her
	office, long story not relevant, might have other clues. Why do you
	think it's impossible that it's Bowser?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	cornered older brother absorb the question wearily. &quot;..Because
	if Bowser was going to stomp all over the pact he wouldn't do it
	like this and you know it. It's.. really that simple.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Mario.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	mean it. I can go into how he behaved the entire time and how he
	never had an inkling of trouble, but it comes down to that right?
	Because even if this is Bowser 'related', no I'm not blinded by his
	fire breath or other capabilities or whatever, it's not </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">from</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">
	Bowser, okay?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi had
	to support himself with that box of test tubes. So some other worser
	villain?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Like
	I said, I was trying not to rant, lil bro. Especially not about 'You
	know who'. Not when I'm.. kinda confused right now. -About multiple
	things, not just him..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">While
	Luigi remained on his feet that time, the blow was like that of a
	bob-omb. No, it would have been a lesser betrayal he felt if Mario
	pulled out a fire flower and shot him point blank in the face. &quot;How
	is it confusing to you and none of us that sees what's going on?
	You're a known thrill seeker and there's nothing that tops a secret
	relationship with Bowser!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Waitaminute!&quot;
	Mario dove for the door handle just as Luigi was about to slip out.
	A struggle ensued. &quot;You really.. wanna know why.. it's because
	I can be myself..&quot; he grunted. &quot;Firstly, he's not
	terrible.. it's just some stock role! Remember he found terrorizing
	the kingdom pointless after a while too, even though most of his
	league were against conciliatory treaties. See, he doesn't care what
	other people think. I wish I could say the same. Whatever scrutiny
	Bowser has, I have quadruple!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Forfeiting
	the tug o'war, Luigi sighed heavily. &quot;-Almost like you're a
	MAIN star or something.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	leaned against the adjacent wall, worn out. &quot;Yeah, on thin ice.
	Remember how some fans reacted when I added that car to Mario
	Party?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
	gotta be..&quot; Luigi bite back a lot of that, clearing his throat.
	&quot;SO their capricious too. If they are used to being defenseless
	and you're their savior, you expect stability?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No,
	but there could have been sooner, if I didn't build this ideal image
	in the first place. Luigi.. I can't emphasize enough how frustrating
	it is that any detail about me that isn't from a game is treated as
	this huge reveal, when I've been like that for decades. Thrill
	seeking with Bowser? No, we'd just go somewhere and not fight, and
	talk and I'd be treated like a normal guy. That's all. Then I'd come
	back home and be plunged into this world where I had to be some
	super hero because other wise how would the Mushroom People react to
	some 'doofy' fat plumber? The pact was supposed to, besides make the
	world better, let me drop the charade, let me go back to the
	mechanical stuff I wanted to do, the zero stakes games, even the
	coaching jobs I wanted to pick up, but it actually happened and I
	just.. I was paralyzed.. &quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Mario..&quot;
	Luigi raced over, his older brother not hiding that subtle quaking.
	&quot;Let's start over. Again again. Yeah I remember what you were
	studying for on the side.&quot; Wait, did he? That unlocked a very
	old pre-Mushroomite life memory when Mario was glued to a black and
	white TV at the shop, knowing the basics of every sport, even
	'Calcio Fiorentino'- which only their old Italian grandparents could
	pronounce correctly. &quot;The worst thing we can do is keep this
	going.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No
	this is something of a comeuppance.&quot; Mario wiped his eyes with
	his sleeve, his affect flat despite that contradicting evidence.
	&quot;Truth is, no matter what's going on, it's a conflict of
	interest for me to investigate. So.. I leave it to you. Full trust.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi let
	him go, blankly. &quot;Wait, what??&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After a
	loud bang outside, Mario brothers scrambled out the closet. A white
	song bird flew around erratically repeating some phrase about a
	'cuz' that mortified Booigi, shivering under a chair and barely
	opaque.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Miss
	Intern, make it stop!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">In the
	chaos, her mocha was splattered on the floor and reception desk, so
	from there, scrubbing with towels, she hit a clicker to attract
	Birdley. He preened silently then from a wooden perch near Mary.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;What
	happened???&quot; Mario asked.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;That
	bird kept mimicking 'Susie', my bully cousin from the press.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-No..
	no!&quot; Luigi piped up, pressing against the windows outside.
	&quot;What do they look like??&quot; He was told. &quot;But.. that
	matches.. Oh God..&quot;</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadsworth
	manned the castle entrance, eyelids growing heavy as a white haze
	obscured the sun gradually. He snapped awake, straightening his
	posture. With a yawn he accepted defeat moments later, and rang his
	special gold bell for assistance. Since peace time began three
	months ago there was a chronic deficit of labor on weekends, Peach
	refusing to task too many to clean up her home all day when they
	could be 'out there, enjoying life' in her words.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">As if
	there was more to a Mushroomite's life than serving their princess,
	Toadsworth scoffed.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Someone
	put away their dust pan and approached, leaner and taller than most.
	&quot;I'm free, Mr. Toadsworth brah.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The elder
	masked his apprehension at the golden yellow toad with tanned skin.
	With a newly miniscule workforce he knew everyone intimately..
	&quot;Thank you Ala-Gold. I will return after a brief recess.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Using
	wifi Ala-Gold messaged another staffer. A shorter, more muscular
	blue toad soon raced down the steps. Having an identical track
	record for accompanying the Mario bros to fight the Koopa Troop in
	wars long past, they gave each other their secret handshake and
	laughed.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Later
	Ala-Gold leaned lazily against the castle's white outside walls.
	&quot;Hate I was stuck on laundry. What's up again?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bucken-Berry
	sat on the bridge's edge, feet dangling down. &quot;'A boat load' as
	you'd say, Gold. I was thinking about hunting the killer down
	myself. I have this grappling technique now and..&quot; he went on,
	loving to talk about fighting.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Whatta
	bout the virus that got Mr. Toad?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He could
	faintly see heat radiate as Bucken-Berry grew silent, balling his
	fists. &quot;..Look, I don't want him to die or anything, but he's
	freaking overrated. He hasn't helped Mario on an adventure in
	decades so why people get googly eyed over that guy I never know.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;It's
	just bout that, bruh?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yes.&quot;
	He swiveled his way. &quot;Or else we're one in a million toads. Get
	it?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	yellow toad dropped that argument for then. Besides, someone was
	walking towards the castle. The stranger's exposed skin was marred
	with old abrasions and holes in his shoes were visible from a mile
	away.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Greetings.
	I have arrived at Princess Peach Toadstool's request for additional

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ala-Gold

	stranger scurried closer. &quot;Umm. Hi, I'm Thomas.&quot; He held
	out his hand and received an awkward shake in return from both. &quot;So,
	I can do literally whatever for Princess Peach Toadstool. I'm ready
	to start now.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-You
	sound funny, man. I can hardly understand you!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bucken-Berry
	shook his head exasperatedly. &quot;Listen better, Gold. This
	'Thomas' has a foreign kingdom accent, kinda like your island one.
	Speaking of.. You sound Darklandian!&quot; Thomas yelped as
	Bucken-Berry twisted his wrist around. &quot;-Ah ha, a Koopa Troop
	tattoo!&quot; He seized the toad, lifting him over his head.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Chill
	out!&quot; Ala-Gold repeated as Toadsworth and two others, the cook
	in an apron and a banker with crumbs in his mustache, shuffled
	outside and onto the bridge.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadsworth
	barged between them. &quot;Are you having a row out here? Cease
	that, I say! What is the matter?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bucken-Berry
	dropped the miniscule toad. &quot;A cretin from Dark Land wanted to
	say hi.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-But
	I don't know rotten Bowser! The tattoo was just to get past a
	checkpoint and I hitched a ride here with some others. I saw an
	opportunity and took it. I promise!&quot; Thomas dropped to his
	scarred knees before the elder. &quot; I only survived this long
	because I moved up to Mayor Koton's office in Neo Bowser City. Just
	about every civilian works for a warlord. Please!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadsworth's
	scowl faded. &quot;Goodness&hellip; You are a Dark Land citizen? Oh,
	you were kidnapped rather. When?.. Too painful to remember?.. I
	won't distress you further. We shall see how your onboarding
	unfolds.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Now, he
	anticipated the grunt of derision from Chef Tim. Mr. Zeror the
	financier in turn, watched expectantly, the thirtish green toad
	begging for more on the payroll lately..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thomas
	bounced back to his feet. &quot;Thank you thank you thank you!&quot;
	and so on&hellip;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toads and
	humans from allied kingdoms were the exemplary servants of the royal
	Toadstool line. Neutral kingdoms, territories, and of course other
	species, were qualifiable too, only subject to more thorough checks.
	Since the Peace Pact, Dark Land was pointedly in the latter
	category, and there was nothing the chancellor could do about it.
	Not when he signed the documents himself.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bucken-Berry
	pinched between his dark eyebrows. &quot;No. Friggin. Way I just
	heard that.&quot; He inhaled deeply. &quot;We haven't verified
	crap!! Excuse the language, Mr. Toadsworth, but we've never done
	this before!!!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Tolerating
	his attitude by a taut thread, Toadsworth replied, &quot;We've never
	had these circumstances either. Until the Princess returns, there is
	no obligation or desire to repel our guest. Now Thomas, who would
	you prefer as chaperone?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thomas
	studied them acutely. &quot;..Yeah, that one. Thank you again, Mr.
	Toadswell.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Ah-hem,
	</font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadsworth</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">.
	Much appreciated volunteer spirit, Ala-Gold. I will return with
	refreshment for you both. Tally ho!&quot; And they went back
	indoors.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ala-Gold,
	standing back the entire time, shuddered. A first for him, he was
	picked. Bucken-Berry leaned into his ear. &quot;Have fun..&quot; he
	said, brushing past his shoulder. Sometimes Ala-Gold wondered why
	Mario coined him 'Cool Blue' in the past except to be ironic.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Once the
	coast was clear, Thomas dove down into the trimmed green grass,
	combing the blades between his fingers. &quot;Can't believe it's
	real!&quot; He rolled onto his back. &quot;And a blue-ish sky. Oh my
	God!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Who?
	And how old are you, bruh?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Just
	an expression. I'm Seventeen.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ala-Gold
	asked if he wanted to experience the opulence of the castle, which
	was refused for some reason. He absently watched the younger red
	toad prance around, skipping, hopping, doing cartwheels and more.
	Bothered, he stepped up to him hesitantly. &quot;Hey, I don't think
	the forty hour work week will be too gnarly, but it's something
	else.. This job is super serious, brah. You ain't hiding nothing,
	right?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thomas
	landed from an acrobatic leap. &quot;Of course not.&quot;</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	continued to wear track marks in the beige carpet. &quot;No no no!
	Check again!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">At Bowser
	Castle, the koopa that was wandering around with a tool box and
	dragged along to act as impromptu accountant, ransacked the small
	room in the northernmost spire.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
	bite his nails watching the guy fling documents around. &quot;-King
	Dad, no one sent an airship..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	almost crushed his dumbphone. His heart was thumping like crazy, and
	yes, for once, he DID care what a couple of people- or to be honest
	one particular person, thought. He'd blithered like some idiot he
	didn't do 'it'. Well, his minions were in town, long after the
	tennis game doing something. What, nobody knew.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;There's
	no way the runts WALKED into town! Ahhhhhgg! I need you kids to come
	down and round them all up for the dungeons. 'Peacefully' I mean!
	And I'm not sure where I want you to meet me yet, so stand by when
	you get here.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;S-sure
	King Dad&hellip;&quot; Lemmy gulped after the call ended. &quot;..He
	wants us to come down and do something about our missing minions. I
	told you Luddy that this might be a problem.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	nodded with a brilliant if mischievous glint in his eyes. &quot;Vater
	has spoken and we shall comply!&quot; He spun to the others, rubbing
	his claws together. &quot;Iggy, configure the systems. Wendy and
	Larry, please prepare the ropes and chains for bondage. Stop
	laughing. Roy and Morton, prepare the artillery. General Lemmy and I
	must prepare a flight plan. We can wake up Kamek to come along as
	well.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Excuse
	me, Luddy-sama. Did I hear something about missing minions ?&quot;
	Iggy lingered as the others scattered.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Affirmative,
	if suspect. The only vehicle that departed this morning was Vater's
	Clown Copter and your friend's shipping truck. I am certain as I was
	watching.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oooh.
	Okay okay, hehe.&quot; Iggy dithered as the others squeezed into the
	old undersized elevator. He darted for the stairway instead.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	brushed that odd behavior off. Perhaps Iggy had wised up to the
	ideal that he should use deodorant in the mornings AND afternoon AND
	evenings. He pressed the ground floor button for them all and the
	steel doors shut. &quot;Yes?&quot; Ludwig groaned after catching
	Larry giving him the stink eye.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
	childishly puffed and faced the elevator back wall like a weirdo.
	&quot;Nuthin!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Morton
	poked Larry's blue shell. &quot;Cheer up, rejoice, celebrate! We
	will get to see the city!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;And
	ya only hafta be 21 to get the Japanese version of Chuckola Cola in
	dat Kingdom!&quot; Roy chest bumped with Morton, making the elevator
	wobble and lights flicker.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Roy,
	you're not even twenty-one though.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
	weren't gonna card for us, Lem? Sheesh!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No!&quot;
	Lemmy answered vehemently. If there was one way to get him serious,
	it was to ask him to do something that could threaten his job.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Roy
	teased. &quot;Yer too lame!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wendy and
	Morton giggled senselessly. Eventually, as the elevator grind
	towards the ground floor, Ludwig gave Lemmy a pat of condolence. By
	Dark Land standards they were the only 'adults' in the room.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	had to leave and start fixing problems now. He frantically moved
	junk out of the way, tripping over a stack of 200lb weights, sorta
	impressive if Mario was deadlifting that stuff, flopping in front of
	the bedroom. Inside were two made up red and green beds with a black
	dresser in-between. He rummaged through the two wooden drawers for
	some disguise, flinging about shirts and overalls until he reached
	the lowest one on Mario's side. A robe was folded around an old
	album. One photo slipped out featuring someone, face obscured,
	cradling Bowser Junior, a helpless baby koopa belonging to a newly
	widowed father.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Not what
	he was expecting..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~Bowser
	Junior was Junior because Queen Clawdia didn't get a chance to
	settle on one name for him. When Bowser as asked, he stated
	'Junior', giving the eighth and final child his name as assumed. The
	funeral afterwards was for himself as much as his wife. As the event
	dragged along, a stealthy cloaked figure drew close to him, evading
	his guards. The 'magikoopa' reached out and touched him. Bowser
	stiffened, opening his crusted over eyes, he realized he was being
	eased into a hug. He recognized the face of the so-called stranger
	and didn't resist. He wasn't sure why at the time, just glad he
	didn't. He needed what his subjects wouldn't dare do at the tense
	moment. The 'stranger's' words of encouragement still echoed in his
	mind to this day.~</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Back in
	reality, Bowser kneeled at the drawer long enough for his back to
	hurt. He cleared up his runny nose. &quot;Stupid Mario you.. Why do
	you still have that?&quot; He shoved the items back where they were.
	He had a better way out of this joint anyway.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-No
	I mean not like together together, just to hang out at the mall?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dave
	tossed his army jacket off and onto the coat rack, just completing
	the last helicopter landing for the day. &quot;Thanks, maybe later,&quot;
	replied the first responder, a handsome Boom Boom about three years
	Emery's senior. She had a cute face to him but he'd been dodging her
	crush forever. He knew workmate romances were like petting an
	untamed chain chomp. You could only get away with it so many times.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Tail
	between her legs, Emery T. retreated to her workstation on the
	opposite side of the landing pad when her personal phone rang.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Hey,
	fangirl&hellip;No, just allergies. So how ya doing? ..Good. I know
	it's crazy but I need a hand. Could ya send a wagon over for an
	'emergency' at so and so?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Whatever
	you say, King. I'm on it!&quot; That area code seemed oddly close to
	Pleasant Path, the last place her favorite villain would be, but she
	dismissed those concerns. Emery caught up with the boom boom at the
	timekeeping terminal.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Dave,
	I got one more call!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Let
	the next shift get it.&quot; He rolled his eyes, walking off.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Doctor
	Professor Koopa waited at the stairs, appearing out of nowhere.
	&quot;Miss Emery? Report to my office please.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Emery
	followed him down into the doctor's office. Doctor Professor closed
	the heavy door behind her and then took a seat at his desk. Every
	time she was sent here for 'behavior' she despised it more, full of
	old furniture, wall high cases of thick dusty books in old
	languages, and shelves presenting as trophies rusty barbaric medical
	equipment fit for a dungeon.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Do
	you know Sebastian Bullet?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Sir?
	I- in the past I guess.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Satisfied,
	Doctor Professor clasped his hands. &quot;You are a smart girl. You
	know unscrupulous service reports, such as those courtesy of Mr.
	Bullet, harm this facility greatly. If only we could determine who
	incited them..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Turning
	into stone, she sputtered, &quot;Check with my mom. She ran the
	phone lines.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Doctor
	Professor leaned closer, adopting a challenging glare. &quot;Nurse
	Nass was indeed, but I think that's irrelevant my dear, since those
	cellular doohickeys exist. -Like the ones we've caught you on all
	day!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	blushed. &quot;Sir, I'm sorry!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He opened
	a manila folder on his desk, containing perfectly intact original
	documents for the MKDCU's patient discharge. Emery was
	unquestionably the nurse that had signed it off. &quot;Not enough.
	You are fired.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Her
	termination did not register for a moment, as she was certain, as
	certain as Peach hating Bowser, that she had burnt those papers
	hours ago and scattered the ashes into the wind.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach's
	shimmering lake awed the young toad. It was ages since he'd seen any
	large body of liquid that wasn't lava. Like a mirror, it reflected
	the sky, the vibrant pink roof of the castle, and his rather scrawny
	self. Every other toad he'd encountered, even old Chancellor
	whatchamacallit, was taller and or more filled out. That might be a
	problem..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He took
	the last slip of the herb tea, keeping the ceramic cup in his paws
	while questioning. Ala-Gold, reticent at first, proved to be a trove
	of information. Apparently he got hired when his only previous
	experience was at a Ricco Harbor inn. Thomas learned if Mario lived
	at the castle, and why not, if Princess Toadstool still had family
	around, how life was in Toad Town, the coin conversion rate, and the
	hardest one yet, if everyone was nice here..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ala-Gold
	didn't answer, standing from the bank. &quot;-Giving ya a crash
	course is fun an all, but I gotta ask, what do you know?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Nothing.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;At
	all brah? No offense but I've met all sorts. Unless ya from Vortex
	Island, you should know this stuff.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thomas
	dropped his cup, backing from the broken pieces. &quot;I am! Or near
	enough.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Brah...
	Then the paradox should make you fifty by now, not a teen-&quot;
	Ala-Gold's naturally low voice was buried under a rocket like
	engine.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Snifit
	Patrol's signature spacey hover car dropped off a dark boo in an
	orange ball cap on the edge of Peach's lawn. The snufit had heard of
	'Susie' via his chief inspector, and picked them up to get a read on
	them. Unfortunately he had to let him go here, the princess not
	liking his squad on her territory to avoid inciting panic. Not a
	decision he agreed with, but 'Susie' wasn't a Bowser minion and
	there was no need to ruffle feathers with other events going on.
	He'd adjust his patrolling route to sweep by another thirty minutes
	from now. Not much should happen until then.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Meanwhile,
	the dark boo's jagged sharp teeth were on display, smiling. &quot;Just
	investigating! There's no Bowser people around here, right?!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After
	motioning for Thomas to go inside, the yellow toad ran up to hold
	him off in the middle of the field. &quot;They call me Ala-Gold
	brah. Steward here. The Princess doesn't let people snoop.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The boo
	produced a laminated card. &quot;But I'm a local and it'll be super
	quick.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ala-Gold
	stifled a laugh at 'Zoo S. Diddley's' Mushroom identification photo.
	Besides it expiring on this very day, he made the most unnecessary
	dumb face with an oversized pink polka dot bow tie in the pic. Legit
	was legit though. They already had a weird reputation with the Press
	and that didn't make it easier. &quot;You gotta get that renewed
	real quick. Not sure how you miss that unless you forget your
	reading glasses or something, man.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	did, in fact.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh,
	no offense, so if you work for the paper come on I guess. We're
	cool, just make it quick like you said.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The dark
	boo licked his lips. &quot;Certainly.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ala-Gold
	tepidly followed him towards the castle. There was something about
	the photographer's eyes, black instead of yellow like most dark
	boos, bottomless black pits that held him captive until Zoo
	voluntarily broke the contact. Sometimes a sailor would stagger into
	the inn like that, but only after treasure hunting and finding a
	Black Chest. Otherwise-</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;While
	I got ya, can I ask something brah?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;...&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Mr.
	Toadsworth keeps finding our paper tossed into the moat. Who do we
	complain to in the office?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;...&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-And
	when does that subscriber promotion kick in?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	stopped abruptly. &quot;Here's your promotion, </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wolley</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">.
	Say cheese.&quot; He snapped a dazzlingly bright photo in Alagold's
	face and stuffed the polaroid in his shirt pocket. When the stars
	cleared from the toad's vision, he was stuck like a statue, muscles
	completely locked.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thomas
	leaned on his tiptoes to see through the peephole. &quot;Mr.
	Toadsworks, there's a-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	have it!&quot; Toadsworth descended from upstairs briskly. &quot;And
	it's Chancellor- Never mind.&quot; He chuckled wryly as he answered
	the door. &quot;Oh, a representative of the Press are you? Due to
	our circumstances we cannot accept presently, thank you.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	phased through the closed door. &quot;Rude bastard.&quot; He glided
	closer making Toadsworth shriek and stumble backwards. Thomas fled
	into the closest inner room. &quot;Is there a Bowser baddie here or
	not?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadsworth
	grumbled, leaning on his stick to stand up. &quot;Tut tut! This is
	Peach Castle innit? So of course not! Be warned, belonging to that
	meddlesome Press downtown, and not on the good side of it, does not
	afford pests like you impunity to trespass! This will teach you-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With a
	ferocious growl Zoo teleported to him and snatched his bell out of
	his grasp before he got one ring out of it. &quot;Funny how little
	it takes to embolden little toadys, like stupid antiques.&quot; Zoo
	examined the shiny weighty bell again. &quot;Actually this one's
	alright. Dad collected stuff like this. Ha ha.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A bead of
	sweat rolled off Toadsworth's forehead. &quot;May I have that back?&quot;
	He ventured as benignly as possible.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yes
	good sir, you may!&quot; Zoo bashed the old mushroom in the forehead
	with the bell. Toadsworth collapsed, dropping his cane, and his
	pince nez cracked when his face smacked the checker tiled floor&hellip;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thomas
	thought he heard mewling in the distance, but he couldn't be sure,
	lost in the maze-like layout of the castle until the painting of
	Wet-Dry World became a landmark. The diagram he'd memorized of the
	castle must have been very outdated as much was now renovated.
	Decisively he rounded another corner and found the fire ax in a
	glass casing. He smashed it with his callused fist without thought
	and bolted to help Toadsworth, he got it right that time, but the
	extra weight from the weapon made him barge uncontrollably through a
	star door, colliding with a servant.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The tray
	of clean plates and cups Bucken-Berry carried crashed everywhere.
	&quot;What the?!- It's you again, you little... What are you doing
	with that, psycho!?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No!
	I wasn't gonna- There's a guy up there and-!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Shut
	up, kid.&quot; Bucken-Berry pinched Thomas's lips closed as some
	ringing became clear. &quot;That's Mr. Toadsworth calling for
	something.&quot; The blue toad piled into the corner the broken
	china with his foot. &quot;Gimme that, now march.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He forced
	Thomas down a long brick hallway to the front where they joined all
	of the other toads working today in the lobby, no one having a clue
	what was going on until Bucken-Berry in particular noticed a shadow
	blending in with the busy floor pattern. He tilted his head upwards
	and cries rippled through the crowd soon after. Their chancellor was
	suspended by his vest on the high glass chandelier, pale and limp
	like a doll discarded by a bored child. A line of blood ran from his
	bruised temple.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	materialized above the sun pattern ornate rug in the center. He
	tossed aside Toadsworth's bell, marred by dry blood. &quot;I don't
	do monologues and I got other appointments so uh, let's be quick.
	Someone here is a buddy of Bowser. C'mon. Which?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;He's
	lost, confused, maybe on drugs,&quot; Chef Tim remarked snidely.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	adjusted his cap. &quot;Oh ho ho, am I? This Peach Castle, 64 Royal
	Lane, built 350 years ago, inherited by Princess Peach Toadstool
	from her dad eighteen years ago, along with chancellor 'Samuel'
	Toadsworth and head castle director, Mr. Toad Toad. Current staff
	working today: assistant Toadette, steward Bucken-Berry, steward
	Ala-Gold, banker Mr. Zeror, tour guide Lester, Chef Timothy- whose
	cooking sucks, gardener Joseph, PR/correspondent Lionel Kinopio-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-How
	did he do that? Someone call Mario!&quot; Chef Tim bellowed.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;How?
	By ringing this for him too?&quot; For effect Zoo rang the bell from
	his reporter's bag. However, it wasn't Toadsworth's gold bell like
	he mistook it for, instead one of his own antiques, one dull and
	yellow and so worn it created only dull thud with each jostle.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bucken-Berry
	shook himself out of that stupor and charged the distracted boo. He
	propelled Zoo backward into the wall, chipping the paint. His next
	punch struck the bricks as Zoo faded away and reappeared behind him.
	Zoo slapped his head against the wall, the toad feeling a chipped
	tooth in his mouth afterwards. Bucken-Berry spun around and caught
	Zoo's arm during the second round. Puzzled, Zoo went intangible,
	applying it to the blue toad as well by contact. They both fell
	through the wall and outside the castle.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A purple
	toad, Les overcame the shock from that scuffle the quickest. He
	picked up the ax and glanced at the area where they'd fallen
	through. Only faint wispy smoke marked the spot. &quot;Well, they're
	probably in the drink. That freak was right about something. We
	aren't gonna sit pretty are we? We gotta go out there, 'aight?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With some
	displeasure, as these two never got along much, Peach's busy public
	relations advisor, Kinopio-Kun a lime green toad who wore long
	sleeves chronically, went to Les's podium and began to call for help
	anyway with the clunky rotary phone. While he worked on that, Les
	addressed the others.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Don't
	mind that spoilsport. Tim, use your pan to beat his brains. Joe,
	your pruning shears will do. Everyone else improvise, including you
	new guy. This your first day? Name?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thomas
	discovered that hiding behind one of Peach's house plants didn't
	work. &quot;Uh, my n-name is..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-And
	why do you sound Darklandian?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Outside,
	Bucken-Berry peddled around in the lake. He was inches from the
	surface when he was hit by a debilitatingly painful sensation. At
	the shore Zoo blasted from his fingertips an invisible beam on him.
	The blue toad involuntarily gasped and sucked in water. He didn't
	have the energy to move anymore as his body sunk like a rock. That
	was when something with the speed of K64 running late tackled Zoo
	from his blind side. Both bodies rolled around on the lakeshore.
	Getting the leg up, this person delightfully slammed the dark boo
	down.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Get
	my good side next time, brah.&quot; Alagold slapped the photo from
	before into Zoo's face as the others burst outside and began to
	cross the yard, following the commotion. They were carrying whatever
	dangerous object they could, one even using a stone garden gnome.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Ugh,
	these guys,&quot; Zoo snarled. &quot;You know you're defending your
	slave house right? I freaking know. I'm half toad.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	castle began to rumble from the foundation. Bricks cracked and pink
	roof tiles fell off as the windows warped and wobbled before
	shattering, their shards spraying into the air and raining down over
	the yard.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ala-Gold
	pulled Zoo aside. &quot;Don't matter what cha are brah. Just quit
	trolling! We work here cuz we love it. Now we've rolled in and wiped
	ya out. Bounce!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Despite
	the earthquake the others circled around, shaken yet steadfast with
	their makeshift arms. Hyperventilating from the ordeal and his anger
	alike, Bucken-Berry emerged from the lake, coughing again and again.
	The water on his skin and clothing began to sizzle.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Friggin
	kill him!!!&quot; he managed.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;NO
	BRAH!&quot; That was the loudest Ala-Gold had rose his voice in
	years maybe, but he was grateful for it. Mario, Peach, no one would
	order execution on castle grounds. Actually anyone dying in such a
	place was bad bad news, an anathema. Gripping the blue toad's arms
	however, he was scary tense all over, not uncommon, just how he
	could be around bad guys. Well there was no question of Zoo's
	badness, just-</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;N-no?&quot;
	Bucken-Berry stammered.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No?&quot;
	Zoo repeated, intrigued..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	effortlessly got off the yellow toad. &quot;-Actually, yeah Gold's
	right. New kid should see this. Get a taste of what happens to
	freaks when they... Where did that pipsqueak run off to?-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo rose
	his hand as Bucken-Berry ran off, unambiguously firing that ray.
	Ala-Gold gasped, leaping forward into the dark boo, where that the
	biology tampering wave sliced him in the middle, turning his
	molecules into mince meat. The yellow toad lifelessly slumped from
	left over momentum, blood flowing from his nose and mouth onto the
	sand. The screams and hysterics were so great, the second after,
	that Zoo got out of there easily and mildly guilty he'd used his
	strength up on Wolley instead of who deserved it. He found someone
	farther off, under the miniature stone bridge where a stream flowed.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	curled his lip at the scamp. &quot;Bro. I woulda spared you. You
	ain't even a baddie yourself, you just traveled with a bunch. Eh,
	I'll tell Mayor Koton to leave a slot open for ya, maybe, if I head
	around there again. Sayonara!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">From
	Royal Raceway outskirts Zoo snapped a headliner photo of the
	property. Using his dad's antiques always had weird effects, but
	this one took the cake. Fitting, since this involved Peach Castle.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	sat around back on the couch, repeating the cycle of checking behind
	the blinds every thirty seconds. Mario texted him 'Toadley Clinic'
	but otherwise wasn't answering calls, which was quite common, the
	plumber having a way to rig his phone. Bowser wished his had such
	features, but he had to use a brand subsidized from his kingdom,
	lead by example an all that. (Meanwhile every one else were using
	import..)</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Some
	funky ambulance, a multicolored truck stamped 'MKDCU' pulled up.
	Bowser threw a bed sheet over himself and rushed out to it.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Can
	I have an autograph?&quot; gushed Sebastian in the driver's seat.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	passenger, an older red shelled parakoopa troopa in a straw hat,
	slapped the younger man lightly. &quot;Quit, this is s'pposed to be
	secret! Howdy, pard.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The back
	doors opened for Bowser. Dreading this all a sudden, he stuffed
	himself into what suspiciously looked like a cage regardless. The
	truck pulled off quickly, bumping him around. He could see into the
	middle and back rows of the car, which seated three other people.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hey
	King!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	detected something off in Emery's tone. &quot;Hey, chick. You
	alright?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She shook
	her head. &quot;I covered all my tracks and that old coot caught me.
	I still don't get it.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Such
	a creep,&quot; Sebastian added, tapping the wheel in beat to some
	Brittney Spearguy song blasting as they tore down a rural path.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Dang&hellip;
	Sorry gal. Wait, I gotta change something. I need to go to some
	'Toadley Clinic' place instead of the hospital.&quot; Bowser
	strained his eyes to see out the tiny slit shaped windows.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Well
	Mr. Bowza, it's your day 'cause we only deliver to the Toadley
	Clinic per contract,&quot; said the monty mole, James. His hazmat
	suit from before was replaced with a formal white shirt and black
	slacks with a fedora.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His day?
	Not even close. Bowser shot him daggers for body checking him
	earlier, succeeding somehow, and then having the nerve to look
	snazzy later. &quot;Whatever, thanks I guess,&quot; he mumbled
	begrudgingly.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The mega
	goomba agent decked out in armor, taking up the entire middle row of
	seating, twisted around, revealing his sour face and bushy goatee.
	&quot;Is this a favor shorty, or are ya sick? We ain't villain
	affiliated!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	agree, for once, with Richard.&quot; A wiggler agent, a glasses
	wearing lanky guy was sandwiched in between Emery and James..
	&quot;Bowser owes five-thousand coins for four units of mileage
	forward and back, plus two-hundred for each additional red light-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Two-hundred
	fifty per red light Wiggletron, jeez,&quot; corrected James, busily
	clacking on a laptop. &quot;We'll go broke cause of you!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	don't have a check book!&quot; Bowser fussed. &quot;Why is this so
	complicated?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;It's
	not..&quot; Emery piped up. &quot;We'll figure it out later. Guys,
	King Bowser has to get there for the sake of the world!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">James
	rolled his eyes. &quot;Pffft. Fine. We'll waive the fee AGAIN..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Parabilly
	switched 'WMUSH' to 'WYMSD?' a folk gospel station. Acoustic
	instruments blared in the truck. The only thing louder was Bowser's
	stomach. Something about the ride made his appetite return with a
	vengeance. He'd been too nervous he guessed in the Mario's home.
	Like they'd read his mind, the van hopped on the mushroom interstate
	and got off on Starman Lane.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;That
	place got NO vegan options for me,&quot; Richard griped as Club 64
	appeared over the horizon.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Parabilly
	reduced the radio. &quot;We're actually head'n to Club Gamecube over
	yonder, Dick. Probabilly gave me a coupon that went bad Hcram, but
	they won't check I reckon if Wigg's can keep his trap shut this
	time!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	wiggler however seemed as though he might compulsively tell the
	truth anyway, making them argue in the drive-thru. Bowser tolerated
	this only because it might save him from ravenously eating a spare
	tire back there.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Bzzt.
	This just in, partners,&quot; the radio host said in a thick, near
	unintelligible drawl. &quot;The total body count is twenty-five
	baddies wrangled for good by that there killer. All up north in Toad
	Town. If yer totin a KT tattoo, stay cooped up somewhere safe, hear?
	We'll hollar at you for the Hootenanny hour in..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Wait
	wait wait&hellip; WHAT?&quot; Bowser leaned up, bumping his head and
	embedding his sharp horns in roof. &quot;Yow! What the heck is going
	on now!?&quot;</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
	princess bum rushed the service desk. &quot;We don't care about
	appointments! Where are they?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Over
	here, princess!&quot; Yoshi scuttled beyond her into the lab with
	Toadette.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Moments
	later, Peach clung onto one of Dr. Toadley's spice racks for
	support. &quot;There must be some mistake!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Is
	it? No it is not.&quot; Dr. Toadley ran some sort of calculation on
	his computers. &quot;Did I suspect as such? Yes I did, so I have
	spoken with partners. They will assist us tomorrow to create a
	cure!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After the
	frenzy settled, they gathered again in the waiting area. As Mario
	scanned their faces, his mental cue cards ineptly scattered in the
	wind so he made it simple. &quot;It's not Bowser.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Eyebrows
	raising, Mary the intern retrieved some earphones and put them on.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
	shot out of her seat, hands on hips. &quot;The Mushroom Flu is from
	Dark Land and it only affected my people today! Why must you insult
	my intelligence? If my enemy is just so innocent, he can tell me
	that to my face!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;He
	can. That's why I told him to come.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	outside doors swung open. Bowser had dark bags under his eyes and an
	understated disposition, plus a headache, but it was him
	nonetheless. &quot;I'm here, that's right. I was about to go crazy
	the way you left me, Mario. Don't you dare do that to me again or
	I'll pulverize ya!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Will
	you?&quot; he replied dryly. &quot;We didn't leave enough in the
	fridge?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Ha
	ha ha.. I only learned from the radio what's going on to my hookie
	playing minions. I told my kids to come here and take care of my
	mooks, what's left of them.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario's
	smile waned. &quot;I wanted to tell you in person but, yeah I'm
	sorry. We had a lead on that we were going to follow after this meet
	up.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh
	were you, plumber!?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	promise.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;O-oh.&quot;
	Bowser couldn't fathom why Mario was acting like that, then he
	blinked a few times, noticing it wasn't just him and his rival, but
	five others watching, three of them so closely they seemed to be
	suspended in animation. Some panic went through the Koopa King for a
	second, but then his jaw clenched. Another way he felt Mario had
	humiliated him today.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Erm..
	Yeah, losers. I didn't make everyone sick and I dunno who did. BUT,
	listen up! It got worse cause Mario wouldn't let me do stuff MY
	way!&quot; He whipped back to Mario, towering over him. &quot;YOU
	don't know what's up Mr. Hero! Why else would you do nothing but
	shove me out of the way, forcing me to have to rely on people I've
	just met today to get from point A to freaking B?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wavering,
	Peach's hands raced to cover her mouth. She noticed Yoshi, Toadette
	and the boo with them in a similar boat, and Luigi only mildly
	perturbed, but still. No evidence of a ruse. &quot;Mario, what in
	star heaven is Bowser talking about? I declare this clinic my new
	sanctioned facility. I will tolerate no more secrecy!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	scintillated. &quot;Perfect, I'm ready to be </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">transparent</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">.
	Finally. I was warring with myself and without realizing it, it's
	compromised the quality of my work. That's unfair to everyone. It's
	like this. I was trying to retire during the pact. You aren't
	imagining that weird period. There's other things I wanted to do,
	and of course I couldn't stop protecting you guys when you needed
	it. Now it's evident it's needed again, pact or not from some
	opportunistic force out there and, with my mind the way it is, the
	best person to deal with that would be: That tall guy right there.
	Yes, you know, my brother, Luigi&hellip;&quot;</font></p>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Who

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That left

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Princess..
	You too Yoshi. I'm in alliance with Mario on this. Messing with

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	had leaned against the window at first, but it began to crack some
	more. He instead settled for standing around in the alley between

	any minute for the red plumber to rope him back and convince him
	that Peach wasn't sneaky. She was and he knew it. Think of line she

	busily crossed by, &quot;You heard me. We are after a purported
	'Zoo'&hellip;&quot; The dino stopped with his back towards the
	alley. &quot;-Honey, regardless of any treaties, the central purpose
	of the Koopa Troop is to disrupt the Mushroom Kingdom. Why,
	doctrinally can't anyone, whether they carry a KT tat or not, attack
	us on their own volition? &hellip;There's no danger of me getting
	killed!&hellip; Hm, maybe a little, this is still a Bowser related
	thing..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser's
	left eye twitched. That shtick yet again..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yosh,
	hold up. Who's your carrier?&quot; Luigi asked from out of view.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Just
	switched to IslandMobile. Why?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;All
	of us YoshiMobile users are up the creek..&quot; He'd checked their
	cellular signal bars. &quot;Toadette, you have Peach's keys and this
	could throw a wrench into things before we've even started. Can you
	verify the outage at their mall kiosk? It's close.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The young
	servant clearly fought between her nice obedient reputation. &quot;Me?
	Umm, yes, but the Princess-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Peach
	is too pouty to go anywhere, so what else would she do with her
	car?...Please?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	couldn't help but to step out from the alley in time to see the
	Birthday Girl Kart and a Mach Bike speeding off from parking meters.
	Wait, so Mario deserted him! The next time he saw him, there would
	be violence&hellip;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Seconds
	later, &quot;For me?&quot; Bowser accepted a scrumptious smelling
	styrofoam container. &quot;Mmm!&quot; His hand was slapped as
	gripped the lid.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Not
	yet.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	walked him back into the Toadley Clinic. Mary the intern flinched
	upon spotting Bowser back indoors. The toad woman cut off her
	conversation with the princess by slipping on earphones and covering
	her face with a Mushroom Inquirer magazine. Mario made sure to stuff
	the receipt from the Dave and Broozers next door deep into his
	pocket and away from the sapphire blue eyes of the princess spinning
	around. A jolt went through her at the way Bowser smirked at Mario's
	side.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	perpetual darkness and crepuscular creatures of Forever Forest, east
	of Toad Town, gave it a gutter level reputation to the masses. Luigi
	suspended his unease at first, Boo would know the safe paths and
	Yoshi an outdoorsman, however the dinosaur couldn't follow them down
	the trail leading in. Trees would block coverage and apparently his
	fianc&eacute; felt she was hung up on earlier. While he got an
	earful, Luigi remained with Boo for a few more moments at the first
	junction.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-I
	can't remember how, I just know my cousin's not normal.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	slipped a hand around them. &quot;We'll be careful. I'll be honest,&quot;
	he continued shakily. &quot;This is about to be the most terrifying
	thing I've ever done. More than rescuing my brother from King Boo.
	More than the first time I even went adventuring in this world. If I
	brought you and things went wrong-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Luigi!&quot;
	The boo went for a hug.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The green
	plumber hugged back. &quot;Don't fret, I got caught up in myself.
	We'll chat later. Okay?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Tense and
	anxious, Boo unlocked their small inherited cabin. They bypassed the
	web filled pantry and marched straight to a back room filled to the
	brim with miscellaneous objects. Just like the stereotype, Boo was
	well aware they were overly sentimental, for them specifically
	manifesting in a kepto-like habit. They thought to tidy up for once
	and clear their mind.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A dusty
	family album was beneath one pile, probably swiped from a relative
	that swiped it from another and so on.. A few pages in were newer
	photos a decade old at most. It showed a huge outdoor arena, and
	then a dark boo in a top hat too large for his head training in a
	red tent. With no whip or chairs he 'tamed', or reduced to a
	stupefied expression a herd of wild red chomps, dino rhinos, and
	rexes by pointing at them only. The youngster smiled at the camera
	gleefully, ostensibly like a parent was snapping that photo.
	Flipping it over revealed a curious handwritten message.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">'Dear
	Drew, I know you are more distant now, and have left the art
	galleries to pursue that doctorate degree, but if you have the
	chance, check up on your older brother more. With our health we
	cannot keep up with his wayward ways. He will listen to you. Remind
	him of older times with this. -Love, Lou'</font></p>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The noki
	detective, now as of this afternoon the temporary intern of a
	hospital bound quasi celebrity, divined his troubles by rushing back
	to the Mushroom Kingdom completely jetlagged. His shoes were on the
	wrong feet! He was masquerading as a tourist yes, but not from some
	backwards place like the Beanbean Kingdom or anything. He mentally
	apologized right afterwards, as an ex-Maple Treeway citizen.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	Koopa turned up his radio unsolicitedly: Snifit Patrol was tied up,
	unable to swing by a famous location. Three people officially held
	the unofficial badges, so as he was technically a vigilante that was
	a call for any other 'vigilantes' step up.</font></p>

	his the push button. &quot;Indeed, madame..&quot; He drove off, if
	mostly because they were next to a Hotfoot Locker, and he hated to
	see the first half of that name anywhere with who it reminded him
	of..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;By
	the way, no way that 'ol Mitch sent ya out the doors empty handed.&quot;
	Kylie unsubtly kept a bulging portfolio on her person as they drove
	along.</font></p>

	anniversaire!&quot; Jelectro tossed a thin floppy folder to her.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	flipped it open in her lap, scanning the yellowed stapled pages in a
	New Donk minute. &quot;This connects to MF? It's his case study.
	We'd hunt down auctions. Once Tutankoopa's necklace was up. We had
	to monitor. Could be 'Special', just a general way we describe any
	kind of object 'blessed' or 'cursed'- don't matter which for sake of
	argument. Either messes people up. A museum can be iffy if okay if
	it's not interacted with much. Some grabby private collector tho was
	a heap of trouble.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jelectro
	divided his attention between her unexpectedly interesting rambling
	and squinting at street signs. Using the car's hi-tech guidance
	systems would reveal private information, and Toad Town developments
	sprung up overnight. He was getting lost and he legitimately lived
	there. Guess it looked different from his usual passenger seat.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The koopa
	reporter closed the report on cue. &quot;Aww raspberries, I let cha
	drive in circles! Royal Raceway is thataway.&quot; She jabbed a
	finger to her far right. &quot;C'mon now! You prolly heard that Toad
	Town doesn't have violent crimes much, but when it happens its like
	a clap of thunder. And then it's done.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hm!&quot;
	Jelectro smiled to shroud irritation at himself.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lilies
	lined the sides of the ramp to Peach Castle grounds. Whenever Kylie
	strolled by on errands she would think about how dedicated her
	gardener was. She'd met the pink toad once. A solid stud, if never
	speaking, only waving. Was he off today? They all drooped at the
	stalks or were withered and brown, creating a motley dilapidated
	sight. Sacrilege, she felt. They were grown like that to commemorate
	Peach taking the throne from her father.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~The
	sepia view, riddled with scratches and distortion, panned around
	rows of corpses lined up in a barren field, only a wiry mushroom
	spotted about divulging its location as the Mushroom Kingdom. The
	carefully preserved WW63 stock footage showcased scenes of the
	Mushroom World's last global war, spearheaded by tensions between
	King Morton Koopa Sr. of Dark Land and King [redacted] of the
	Mushroom Kingdom. As history went, the stars were favorable to the
	human king and K. Morton was cornered in Water Land and diced to
	pieces by allied forces.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A hand
	made a firm grip on Bowser's forearm. That's what his 'friend' got
	for nagging to watch those old reels in the attic. With that out of
	the way, they share the buzz of excitement. They planned to travel
	far to the Waffle Kingdom and back before dark, a location neither
	had seen outside of Luigi's writings. They learned while ambling
	around that he had not embellished one bit. There was a syrup river
	and hills made of pancake. They laid back on the high calorie soil,
	watching the pink cotton candy clouds drift about. Like usual,
	something mundane they were chatting about escalated into debate.
	Bowser thought he always dominated these. He was louder, scarier,
	stronger. His friend on the other hand more observant, unfortunately
	for him. A well timed shove sent him spinning on his shell
	uncontrollably down hill, and splashing into a soda lake. Cherry
	cola.~</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	rose up from the cot and swung at Dr. Toadley, missing by a hair.
	&quot;AHH! THAT WAS CHEATING YOU-... I mean .. I'M NEVER DOING THAT
	AGAIN! ...I just.. It's useless..&quot; he tacked on, coughing.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	doctor grumbled as he lowered the invention, a zapper with a dish on
	the end with a swirl pattern etched on it. &quot;Did I have the
	switch flipped to 'happy place' and not 'sad place'? Yes I did.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	irritably slung his feet out of the bed. In the lab space he took up
	the sixth spot next to the others, including Toad and Daisy,
	remaining unconscious. &quot;You didn't send me far into the past
	during the first Mushroom Flu. You sent me 'kinda' in the past,
	during a moment when I was watching something that predated the flu.
	.. I don't feel like explaining it. When is Peach's turn?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;When
	she's back. Sure you didn't see anything that might help?&quot;
	Mario asked. &quot;You kept mumbling.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Blushing,
	&quot;You were watchin' me??&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;For
	science, jeez!! You've seen me sleep. How else would you know the
	brand of my sleeping mask?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	laughed dryly. &quot;I didn't know that Mini Bowser had a record
	feature. Scary to put that in children's toys, ain't it?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Meanwhile,
	the loud squeak of a cart the intern was pushing around was verging
	on unbearable. She hurried to get away from Bowser, Mario suspected.
	The plumber removed his hat and swapped it for a worn in black
	leather jacket with assorted patches hanging on a coat rack. He
	slipped it on, just a half size too large. Machine oil and beer
	struck his nose.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh!
	Sir?&quot; The intern fumbled with the vials on the rack. &quot;That's
	mine. I mean-&quot;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Yeah,
	your boyfriend or someone. I&rsquo;m just borrowing it for a sec.
	Peach is </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">still</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">
	in Dave and Broozers and I doubt it&rsquo;s because she&rsquo;s
	having a ball. I need to be less recognizable.&rdquo; He heard
	Bowser groaning already. So clingy, he thought with alacrity. &ldquo;Stick
	here, but since you gave this a fair shot and you were dreaming
	about food, you can open that box I gave you,&rdquo; he said on the
	way out.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Inside
	was a slice of yellow cake with white frosting, red and blue candies
	adorning the top. A couple&rsquo;s cake.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jelectro
	slammed the brakes, spinning the car ninety degrees where Royal
	Raceway terminated. Peach's Castle was no longer there, only a deep
	crater with pipes gushing water. All the vegetation, the grass,
	trees, garden in the back, were dead. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Help!!&quot;
	Chef Tim saw the car first, apron stained red. A lime-green toad in
	the lawn whimpered while holding one of his legs, clothes sparkling
	from broken glass. He kept complaining it was broken, and that he&rsquo;d
	never get to travel with Peach and pretend to be a rich socialite
	again. A golden yellow toad was sprawled across the lake shore,
	darkened by his blood. A mature purple toad worked busily to
	resuscitate him.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	Koopa stumbled out of the car, agape.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-One
	of our stewards ran for help because phones are dead,&rdquo; Zeror
	explained.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Start

	dope??&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Les
	slowly stood up from Alagold. &ldquo;It happened in a blink. A so
	called reporter came by, a boo-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	trembled. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she whispered. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-And
	tried to start a witch hunt for Darklandians. Now our latest toad is
	missing, along with the castle, and Old Toadsworth. Got your
	story??&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Where&rsquo;s
	the princess?...With Mario? We&rsquo;ll find them and get you help.
	Hold on-&rdquo; Kylie retreated to the car, appalled that the noki
	was glued in his seat. When she sat down she began to worry. He was
	pale and in a cold sweat, grimacing. &ldquo;Bond, what&rsquo;s
	happening?&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mitch..&rdquo;
	</font>
	</p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	Airship One vibrated and exuded noxious black smoke in places not
	thought possible the longer it flew, a harsh reminder to Ludwig Von
	Koopa that he hadn&rsquo;t personally taken the menacing beast, the
	oldest flying machine in Bowser&rsquo;s fleet, on a proper
	expedition in years. Newer aircraft were at his disposal, but this
	one had a history central to his objective, enough to make him
	overlook the lack of doppler radar, yaw dampeners, and cup holders.
	Scratch the doppler part. Because of that, they&rsquo;d hit a
	hurricane over Water Land, forcing most of them below deck&hellip;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry&rsquo;s
	wooden bench squeaked as he stood up on it to peek over his older
	brother&rsquo;s phone. The MP3 player that was driving his red BATES
	by Dr. Greg headphones at full blast had died moments ago. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy
	quickly flipped it screen down. &ldquo;Oh, Larry-chan, haha just
	texting Sam and Slam. They&rsquo;re luh-olded they keep bragging
	online. Err, think they misplaced a decimal though on their
	paycheck. Puzzling when they are the top math wizards in college. &rdquo;
	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boring.
	Everyone breathed on each other among a concoction of gunpowder,
	soot, and toejam. No electricity or charging ports, just wooden
	splinter filled seating. Larry checked out a foggy porthole window,
	unable to see much. Wendy detached from the &lsquo;cool&rsquo;
	bunch, Roy, her, and Morton, the latter if just for a prop, to seek
	out Iggy. They were discussing some game until Lemmy joined them. On
	the trip until now, Larry only saw his face in a training manual. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Excuse
	me sis. Sup, Iggy! How much did you pay them?&rdquo; Lemmy cringed
	at Iggy&rsquo;s answer, more so upon getting a technical explanation
	involving extra drag from the weight they took on. &quot;Leeet's not
	tell Luddy about that.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Pretending
	to be occupied, Larry snickered. &lsquo;Yeah, squirm goody
	two-shoes!&rsquo; Sam and Slam didn&rsquo;t work for their dad, but
	the mischief they sparked at times rivaled any koopaling. Once at a
	party they triple dared Lemmy to kiss a girl. The chain-chompette
	was flattered and a good sport about the spectacle, but it was so
	awkward it wasn&rsquo;t even funny and she was definitely pregnant
	because of that. Psyche! (In the spirit of Lem.)</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The doors
	above opened, letting wind roll in. A drenched Ludwig stood at the
	top of stairs. &ldquo;We have arrived-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
	trampled him completely in the chaotic rush for fresh air.
	Flattened, Ludwig checked his watch. Only an hour or two later than
	the estimated arrival.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy bent
	all the way over the railing, virtual-reality goggles strapped to
	his face to enhance the signature green hills of the Mushroom
	Kingdom jutting upwards. First the outskirts, Goomba Village, Flower
	Fields, then the dense capital city. Kamek cruised them cautiously
	high. After the threat of suffocation subsided, everyone found their
	vices once more on the breezy slippery deck. Roy never hung up with
	the new name compared to two days ago. Morton and Wendy clung around
	him in mutual interest of who girl #282,938 was, etc..</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Umm.
	Luddy, could you show me that concert hall?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He dusted
	himself off and stepped over. &ldquo;The Royal Toadstool Opera?
	Direct your attention there..&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	younger brother beamed upon locating its golden dome. He got to see
	it for a moment before clouds rolled in.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">..And
	why do you ask, General Lemmy? Only I am aware due to being an
	acquaintance of an acquaintance who is a tenor in composer Bise&rsquo;s
	acapella brigade. Astronomically exclusive, unless of course YOU are
	invited to perform in it. Then you are bestowed indisputable
	permission to occupy that beautiful, glorious- tell no one I
	complement it so- theater.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With
	everyone busy and the town hidden, Larry snuck over to their snoring
	driver. He knew how to time Kamek's power naps. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-
	Interesting,&rdquo; Lemmy giggled forcibly. &ldquo;...What if
	someone with a high position in Dark Land was invited and wanted to
	perform, but not disassociate themselves from the Troop or
	anything?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Checking
	over his shoulders, Larry rolled the wheel subtly enough to hide the
	banked turn. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-That
	poor soul must never grace our homeland with their presence again!
	To partake at the table of the princess for any reason is a renegade
	maneuver. Must I explain their pedagogy?!&rdquo; Ludwig ranted.
	&ldquo;They are unable to eschew their speciest trite about
	non-mushroom people.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	know I know.. Psyche! Ha ha..&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
	matched with the longitude his app told him too. Thank Boogle Maps.
	It cheered him up better than finding a wallet on the ground full of
	cash. On their new course they&rsquo;d head north, rise in altitude,
	and beach catastrophically on Star Hill, ending their trip. He
	climbed into a lookout post to bide time. He wondered what his
	online friends were doing in town. How they may react if they knew
	he was above their city about to -almost- invade?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bang!
	They violently came to a stop, ejecting Larry into the air. When he
	came to, he was back on deck with a headache. Everything not nailed
	down was knocked overboard and their sails were shredded. Even more
	bizarre, he was starting at Peach Castle, suspended in the air with
	them. The windows were shattered, the paint chipped, and the hollow
	darkened structure was plucked from the ground imperfectly, creating
	an eerie left tilt on the impenetrable floating platform they&rsquo;d
	crashed into. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Behind
	him lots were being drawn.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Come
	back here, please. Is it not enough that you allowed us to get blown
	off course??&rdquo; Ludwig fussed at the geriatric magikoopa
	shuffling around, covered in small bandages like the others. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kamek
	muttered something about being innocent, continuing to circle the
	deck except for the bow that caved in from the impact. The results
	were in. Morton was chosen. He eagerly accepted and hurled himself
	overboard without looking down, smacking flat against a low point of
	elevation. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m okay&rsquo; he yelled back. Roy and
	Wendy immediately decided they were accompanying him. It was too
	frosty out here for their blood and they wanted either action or to
	snatch a goodie or two. That left Iggy with a broken and loose but
	fully armed and operational VR headset on his face. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Since
	28.57 percent of us have deviated, how much would it upset you if it

	to scan the castle&rsquo;s interior and find those rumored sealed
	copies of SM64.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	waved him off with a groan. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
	fought his vertigo to stand up. What a sick joke. That was his best
	con he felt. What was left? He wracked his brain. Ludwig owned
	theology books that he'd skimmed through for a pop quiz. One thing
	Larry remembered was that star heaven had disturbing parallels to
	his high school. Maybe they'd dip their divine toes in this mess. </font>

	<p><em>&rsquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yo,
	stars above. Confuse the speech of my enemies!&rsquo; </font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	opened his eyes and saw a fight.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">General
	Lemmy, I concern myself not with those unaccounted for delinquents!
	Do not covertly whisper such to me again. After I destroy the
	Mushroom Kingdom they will effectively be back home anyway. It is
	obvious that the two we actually sent here, Sam and Slam,
	accomplished their mission. Last I checked the hospitals are full.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">But
	we've screwed up so much King Dad's not gonna care about how
	&lsquo;brilliant&rsquo; your plan was!!!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	will when I have the princess!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
	princess? Look!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wendy was
	in the front, she&rsquo;d even taken her shoes off in the mad dash.
	Roy, Morton, and Iggy were behind her and Roy had a body tucked
	under his arm. Wendy took the ladder while her brothers ascended the
	hull with their bare claws, beating her pace. Morton flopped down
	like a dead cheep cheep on the deck, under the snapped and torn
	rigging. A weird gait was normal from Iggy, not exactly the king,
	prince, duke, or earl, of good posture. Now however he slithered low
	to the ground and hid below deck. Roy was over exerted but sound it
	seemed until it was discovered he was mute. The extra person toted
	along was a beaten black and blue Chancellor Toadsworth.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ahhhh!
	What happened??&rdquo; Lemmy lost balance with his ball.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wendy
	made it onboard. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know!!!! OMGOMGOMG-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Sister
	mine, English!&quot; Ludwig begged. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	only got as far as the first big room. It&rsquo;s ruined and
	everything is hazy inside. So crazy. Part of upstairs collapsed too.
	I was gonna go deeper with them, but there was this weird rumble
	thing I kept hearing. I thought maybe not, but y'all know I don't
	just bail on folks..&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Flustered,
	Ludwig nodded. &ldquo;General Lemmy, Wendy, even Kamek, secure
	everyone below deck. Larry, bypass Iggy&rsquo;s password and try to
	use that application he has to trace the location of Vater&rsquo;s
	last communication. I will distance us.&quot; Working in some sort
	of automatic mode, he spun their airship into a deep starboard turn.
	Debris broke off from their superstructure as he pushed the ship to
	full power in a spontaneous direction. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
	didn&rsquo;t know to be afraid or giddy as he traced the location of
	their father. Everything moved turbo fast then. He wished he
	remembered to be... careful of what he wished for!</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
	had a problem. She'd gotten sidetracked, took too long, and now
	things were getting damp and she couldn't get Peach's top on- on her
	convertible rather. She would press the electric switch and nothing
	would happen aside from a faint mechanical buzz. Why did she let Mr.
	Luigi talk her into this? In the mild precipitation, she barely
	caught the royal blue spots and vest of her boyfriend dragging his
	feet on the side of the street.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	swerved over. &quot;Blue! Oh my goodness, this is random but great.
	I've come up with an alibi. Get in.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He perked
	up somewhat, making the suspension creak when he got in the
	waterlogged kart. Though he disguised it under his ordinary steely
	mask, she could tell he'd shed tears very recently.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Where's
	Mario and Peach? I gotta see them now! I told the police.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Frowning,
	she pulled off. &quot;I'm missing something?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He leaned
	over and gave her a quick kiss. &quot;Thank Eldstar you're safe.
	Some batsh- some.. crazy dude attacked us and the castle and-&quot;
	In a sudden fit he slugged the side view mirror. The enclosure
	snapped and dangled by a wire. &quot;Oh stars.. Sorry baby..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	blanched. &quot;..I'll take the fall for that if you get the hood on
	with minimum destruction.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Buckenberry
	broke only one cheap plastic tab pulling it over them manually,
	freeing them from the rain. That might have been a bad deal she'd
	just made.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hi
	there. Is this a fun place?&quot; A man with a shy soft voice seated
	himself on the stool next to a blonde woman in a white doctor's
	coat.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
	crossed leg over the other, training her eyes across the bar where
	there was a dark laser tag room. While there weren't many kids
	playing arcade games, skeeball, ice-hockey, and other activities
	today, she remained hesitant to explore or remove the half baked
	disguise. &quot;It seems wholesome, but I hazard I'd never known it
	existed if not for unfortunate events today.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	refused a beverage from the bartender. &quot;-Like what, doll?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	stirred her hot tea. &quot;You would think I'm hysterical! No need
	to weigh you down,&quot; she remarked playfully.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Surely
	not too heavy for Mario,&quot; Mario replied.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She faced
	him, dumbstruck. In that less signature state he possessed more of a
	glow if anything, the jacket, hair, short stubble. In aggregate
	though, it was another person, and she wasn't so obtuse to refuse to
	see it. &quot;-I told you my contributions about that tragedy won't
	get us a fraction closer to the cure. Leave me be.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His gaze
	bore into her as he returned to her tea, drumming his fingers on the
	counter. &quot;You can't get over Bowser. Is it because he's so
	different or because you can't see it?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Neither
	of those. I'm processing matters.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;So
	am I, but none of us can control the pace now. Least you could do is
	not be another-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;What,
	Mario?&quot; Her cup clank against the table. &quot;Excuse me for
	not being able to change overnight!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Overnight?!
	Am I not tolerable if I'm not stomping bad guys for you?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
	are intolerable when you pester me, Mario. That is what.&quot; She
	sipped an empty cup, flushing. The bartender had not so subtly
	stayed away during that spat, and still wouldn't get her next order.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Two adult
	toads burst inside. Bucken-Berry and Toadette dodged the ticket
	booth, trampled velvet ropes, and tugged Peach into the private
	party rooms, right under Mario's nose. Startled he waited outside
	the room. Peach sobbed something about the castle and.. Mario was
	missing pieces and shouldn't try to pry information now. He decided
	to simply ring up Toadsworth with the castle landline.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	crept into the Dave and Broozers back office when no staff were
	looking. He closed the door, inadvertently locking himself in a tiny
	room. He'd deal with that later. He picked up the grungy beige wall
	phone. While it rang he noticed the old newspaper clips taped to the
	wall and some stale french fries and pizza on the counter.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;HELLO?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	flinched. That was louder than any motorcycle. Louder than a jet!
	&quot;I-is this Peach Castle?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;YES,
	IT IS.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
	particle-like appendage seeped from the speaker, coiling around his
	neck. The strangled plumber was lifted up and slammed against the
	water dispenser, toppling the stacks of paper cups, then across the
	counter, knocking off the food and microwave. He couldn't pull it
	off, consciousness fading. Last he recognized was a thud, the door
	kicked open. Someone stomped over frantically and helped him tear
	the entity off. With a threatening roar it phased away from their
	palms with no trace. Mario would have passed out, blue faced, if his
	rescuer didn't support him by both shoulders.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Well,
	say somethin'!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The black
	spots in his vision cleared. &quot;Bowser, oh God. You must of
	followed me and- A monster or something at her castle attacked over
	the line..&quot; He laughed weakly at how he sounded. &quot;Anyway,
	you had my back. Thank you.&quot; He closed the distance, nestling
	his face against Bowser's collarbone.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	warmth of a human Bowser had become accustomed to, especially today,
	but the brush of that mustache against his thick scale plates in
	that particular way was new, exciting. With a small gasp he pushed
	back. &quot;S-stop. We can't.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Sorry.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	fidgeted. &quot;Nah. I don't know why I said that..&quot; He pulled
	Mario closer, smothering him all over again.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Peach's
	and I's thing that never was is.. extra never gonna be,&quot; he
	droned, lulled by their embrace.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	barely got that.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yeah..
	I.. know.&quot; Mario accepted that didn't want to return to the
	countless adversities waiting outside.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Well,
	believe that I'm not dazed and confused when I say this. Peach's
	castle just broke up with- the Earth!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Darn it.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A little
	boo belched and swayed as they emerged from Club Gamecube, Club 64's
	competitor. It was the happy hour, and Boo took advantage of a half
	price Morel Moxie to not faint from exhaustion running ragged around
	Toad Town. Too worried to think straight, they&rsquo;d had an
	additional sip of another beverage at steep discount, a Chuckola
	cola, the Japanese version. That was quite stupid they understood
	once the stomach began to rumble. Trying to keep right side up on
	the street, they thought they hallucinated a low Bowser Doomship, an
	ugly spot in the sky, diving beneath a cloud. They rubbed their
	reddened eyes and it was still there, going north.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	forces were attacking!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo
	followed the trail into a more rural part of town. Few buildings and
	no high rises, just mushroom fields. Blind sided, they walked into a
	metal road sign, 'Watch for crossing Ostros.&rsquo; Dealing with
	that throbbing on their forehead, they anguished. Why did they botch
	everything? Why couldn&rsquo;t they follow instructions? </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Why
	couldn&rsquo;t they avoid getting ran over by a truck?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">HONK. A
	colorful medical van swerved around the body on the dirt path. It
	braked and went into reverse, parking beside Boo. The paratroopa
	passenger&rsquo;s window rolled down. &ldquo;Partner, now you KNOW
	that&rsquo;s not the place to hit the sack!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo; <font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Let&rsquo;s
	goooooo,&rdquo; whined the ansty toad girl in the back. &ldquo;I
	gotta tell my King something and we can&rsquo;t miss him!!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah.
	It&rsquo;s just a drunk, shorty,&rdquo; Richard added.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Offended
	and more sober, Boo impetuously distanced themselves from the MKDCU
	and returned to town. Glancing at Zoo&rsquo;s photo ever so often,
	the main reason they&rsquo;d ventured out renewed in their mind.
	This was why the phone thing sucked so much. Their cousin had a
	weakness and only they knew it. They had to get to the park.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;We'll
	handle it. Have a good day.&quot; Luigi eased the snufit towards his
	silver patrol car parked in a flower bed.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Gotcha!&quot;
	Snifit Patrol put away his taser, the area cleared. &quot;We're on
	full alert for Zoo. My sergeant will get the toads and drop them off
	at Hotel Mario... What's the issue with it?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	didn't have time to explain, retreating to the picnic area of Toad
	Town park. &quot;Now what's wrong, Yoshi?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The dino
	sat on a tree stump agitatedly. &quot;It's the mingle advert you
	made with my phone. Typing it in Darklandian? Including some kind of
	'emojis' you said represent Bowser affiliation? I'm lost.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	rolled his eyes, then waved to the four others with him at the
	table. &quot;Flare, Gloomba, and Chuck weren't. Yoshi, please scout
	for us again. It's important.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The Toad
	Town park was a donut shaped plot of green, the center tightly
	packed shade trees overgrowing the garden that was once there. Yoshi
	absently patrolled the weathered brickwork of the walking paths and
	around the statues of old patriarchs erected here and there. No
	pedestrians were encountered unless he tread to the street's edge.
	Since the meeting at the Toadley Clinic, he kept waiting in vain for
	Luigi to reveal the extent of his plan. Being given simple orders,
	like he was just some toad and not someone with more experience
	arguably than Mario, embittered him in a way he couldn't hide
	anymore.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A sports
	car skidded to a stop at the Mushroom Press a block down. A short
	noki and a koopa girl argued before he left her behind. As he sped
	away off, the girl recklessly hopped into the trunk.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	ventured inside a quiet office building, the Press. Cold air
	condition blast hit him right away. Birdo worked in a place like
	this before becoming an influencer, so he knew the layout. This was
	ground zero for their target. If Luigi didn't want him to wander off
	and educate himself, be straight with him!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I'll
	try.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh,
	I didn't notice... Yes it's Yoshi, sorry to intrude. A reporter here
	is one of my suspects you may say. Am I allowed to browse?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The guy
	Yoshi stumbled upon in the cubical nodded slowly, his youthful beady
	black eyes narrowing suspiciously behind tortoiseshell horn rimmed
	prescription lenses. He seemed like the archetypical yuppie with a
	dry impersonal tone. His desk was tidy and a touch bougie with the
	fake gold plated office d&eacute;cor, including a framed abstract
	painting. Work related, this person had posted detailed lists. Due
	to the jumbo font they were deliberately printed and the fact that
	his computer displayed the local message boards, Yoshi sleuthed he'd
	been following current events.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Thank
	you. Since you are here, do you have any details on Susie, aka Zoo
	Diddley?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">One of
	the man's thick black eyebrows arched in amusement. &quot;This is
	his space.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Beaming,
	the dino swept the area again. Yoshi anticipated squalor, but
	apparently not. &quot;Wonderful. What were you doing here?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Are
	you stupid bro?&quot; The boo removed his glasses.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Like a
	veil lifted, Yoshi registered he was face to face with Zoo, at his
	throat in an instant.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Shhhh!
	No screaming in the office.&quot; Zoo shoved Yoshi through the wall,
	phasing them both outdoors, the dinosaur specifically stunned on his
	butt. &quot;I HATE THAT FREAKING LUIGI!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	climbed to his feet, flabbergasted. Zoo hiding in plain sight? How
	could he be so na&iuml;ve? He sprinted as fast he could through the
	park. The grass sprouted ten feet tall, making him scale over. The
	statutes animated and chased him, firing off musket rounds that
	hummed past his ear. The trees stretched their limbs to entrap him.
	A sand castle in the lot rose to scale, becoming a labyrinth.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	rushed to where Yoshi collapsed, yards away from the tables. &quot;Yoshi?
	What happened?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	appeared beside him with a whoosh. Luigi jumped back and the baddies
	at the picnic table recoiled. &quot;Me. If you didn't cut me slack
	with the bike I swear I'd.. So why are you luring me here?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	hesitated for a second. &quot;W-what's the password?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo held
	a blank expression.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
	found the ad but you can't read Darklandian. Why did you blend in
	with baddies to try to kill them off later? Without leaving a mark?&quot;
	As the dark boo flushed, he knew his theories were hitting the mark.
	&quot;Regardless, you have something to do with this virus plot. You
	were at the game with the sodas. You've been around the hospital.
	You've been where every dead soldier was. Yet, it's not your scheme.
	Who's is it?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	leered at the baddies, making them screech and scatter chaotically,
	then composed himself. &quot;I give ya a B+ on that assessment,
	Sherlock Mario.&quot; He laughed cryptically, Luigi standing his
	ground. Like he hadn't heard a million boos cackle by then. &quot;Bro,
	the press job wasn't even to watch that boring game. I've been
	trying to be an office worker forever. Better than that the
	entertainment biz. I got caught up in something that led to another
	thing and another thing and on it snowballs. That's all you need to
	hear. Split bro. Or else.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	folded his arms. &quot;I will not.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	will make you,&quot; Zoo said deliberately. &quot;And this will
	leave a mark.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There was
	a piercing sensation across Luigi midsection, like a cleaver chopped
	him. His vantage rose upwards by a couple of inches, but his boots
	were still planted on the ground. Looking down, his face twisted in
	agony. Like a medical diagram, he saw into the lower half of his
	lungs where his body was abruptly severed, into his stomach, liver,
	and upper large intestine, pockets of bile in exposed sections. He
	didn't bleed, like the force splitting and suspending him holding it
	back, but he could still feel every bit of his skin and organs
	ripped apart.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He was
	losing his body, but if he could speak he'd be saying </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I've
	lost my head</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	jolted upwards in hysteria that only lessened when he noticed eye
	movements from the still alive green plumber, trained to something.
	The dino twisted around. He couldn't believe who it was.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Meanwhile,
	Zoo caught slow sluggish Chuck right away, wedged in place after
	trying to hide in a tube slide. The dark boo detected however that
	when the spike was done with that nervous breakdown, he was going to
	live with his mom in Ice Land and never talk about this again. Those
	others were the problem then.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Flare and
	Gloomba tore across the field, almost out of the park. Flare was an
	older koopa, getting left behind constantly despite his protests.
	They came upon a portapotty and Gloomba dove in first, shutting out
	Flare.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He banged
	the plastic panel. &quot;Soldier, you will let me in!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Tough!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	benignly walked up behind Flare and snapped the lock. &quot;GET
	OUT!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hey
	buddy!&quot; Gloomba, younger stubbly faced foot soldier, stumbled
	into the open. &quot;I'm on your side, for real.. That guy stinks.
	Kill him instead!&quot; Flare gave him a poignant look.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	clicked his tongue. &quot;Don't tell me what to do.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Gloomba
	wailed, his dark grey flesh glistening and expelling from pores
	moisture. The invisible force crushed him and his shriveled corpse
	flopped into the grass.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The fire
	brother stopped squeezing his eyes shut. He was still alive, but
	with that sadistic look on Zoo's face, he knew the mercy was
	fleeting. He calmly remained there, no resistance.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;If
	this is my punishment, so be it. I came to support King Bowser's
	tennis game and not to desert or quit. I've always loved the sport.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hmm.&quot;
	Zoo chuckled dryly, revealing a green Bowser racket. &quot;Prove it.
	Give me your best serve.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	volunteer for him. Swap,&quot; someone said, voice somewhat clogged
	and gritty. They had a huge purple knot on their forehead and
	faintly reeked of a bar, but they were simultaneously alert and
	shifty eyed.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	whipped around. &quot;Cuz?&quot; He saw what was slid into his hands
	in exchange. A photo of his first performance on tour with his
	immediate family, taken in Donut Plains. &quot;Where did you find
	this?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Doesn't
	matter. Unfortunately for you, I remember everything. I. Remember.
	Everything.&quot; Booigi the Second rose the racket into the sky.
	&quot;By the power of Eldstar, this will be the last day you bully
	me.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lightning
	flashed above. Yoshi was heading over when he dove under the jungle
	gym. Upon finding that it was nothing, he brain was screaming to get
	out there, do something, underpowered or not. His sixty-four year
	old, engergy sapped body said otherwise..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
	showing off for your plumber crush back there? Which half of em?&quot;
	Zoo cooed, making kissy faces. &quot;Ha, dweeb.&quot; He fired his
	death ray against his older cousin to no effect, short of angering
	Booigi more. He remembered he could only mutilate living things, and
	even worse he got his teeth bashed in by the racket.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The dark
	boo skid backwards until a concrete base stopped him. The bust of
	Princess Mush IV, frequently defaced for being so controversial as a
	ruler, shattered from impact. Dazed, he felt lighter. To his horror,
	the impact dislodged his father's bell from his pockets and it lay
	in the grass between him and his cousin, racing at him.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No!&quot;
	Zoo scrambled to hover protectively over it.. &quot;Back off! My old
	apartment burned! That's the last thing I still have from dad and
	I-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Booigi
	teleported behind him and snatched it. &quot;I'm gonna bat it outta
	here!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	chased them around the field. Even tipsy, Boo was faster and more
	experienced in teleportation Zoo learned infuriatingly. It didn't
	help that Zoo had left behind his eyewear at the office. He's gotten
	dozens of scrapes and cuts from bumping solid objects around the
	park. Finally his cousin held the bell precariously over a fountain.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	abruptly froze. &quot;Listen cuz. I'll leave if I can keep that.
	It'll be like a body under the bridge. I mean water, haha.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Booigi
	lowered the antique. &quot;Tell me everything.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No,
	I'm not a minion, but Ludwig let's outside help do menial jobs
	sometimes. I clean up Bowser's Castle on weekends. That's how I knew
	some scheduled stuff. That's all. Here is where I wanted to work,
	not there. Then at the stadium I was r worded enough to pass around
	sodas from Iggy's nerd friends. I didn't know they were with the KT,
	one had some mental block, or that the soda was poisoned and I don't
	freaking care! Less to compete against me when I'm making six
	figures!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;And
	the murders??&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Can't
	have this ordeal on a resume, bro.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Don't
	call me that by the way.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yeah,
	shut up.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With a
	sly grin, Booigi shook their head. &quot;But, I didn't show you my
	swing.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The dark
	boo's jaw dropped when Booigi tossed the bell into the air and
	sliced it with the racket, seeing it up up and away, into the sky
	and out of view. Like a mad man, Zoo bolted after it, out of the
	park.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Back at
	the picnic tables Luigi fell to the ground whole. Numbly he kept
	patting where the cut was. Under his shirt, he found an ugly scar
	circling his midsection. That was the last he remembered. Yoshi saw
	him fall out, caught him in fact. A mild earthquake lasted for a
	second, originating from something a great distance away. Then
	silence.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Then not
	because YoshiMoblie, proudly Toad Towns largest wireless provider,
	began to work again.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
	dropped down a ladder at the location Iggy's cell directed, Mario's
	house. Wendy personally went down to break in. Empty. On the way out
	a toad neighbor, an overweight dude in a robe with coffee, spotted
	her. Not the type they'd think to own a Bullet Blaster kart, but
	whatever. The seventeen year old in a panic vaporized him with
	Iggy's laser gun from an anime. Once the smoke cleared, all that was
	left of him were his slippers.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	koopaling teen raced to cover her mouth. She'd seen the commercials.
	They claimed it only had 'play' laser action! Before they left, a
	van stopped under their airship. Some toad girl was kicked out and
	waved desperately for them.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;What
	do you want? Also you totally didn't see us here or anything!&quot;
	Lemmy called down.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I'm
	tight with King. I've made up my mind and I will join you. A toad is
	your best weapon. Trust me!&quot; she yelled upwards.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
	tried to consult Ludwig, but he disallowed his concentration to be
	broken, going on about a 'phenomena unexplainable by accepted
	scientific principles, leaving only the 'unaccepted' ones'.. Wendy
	and Lemmy glanced at each other and allowed her on.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Emery T.
	hopped around excitedly, disregarding the ship's deplorable
	condition. She told them Bowser must still be at the Toadley Clinic
	then. Duh. Why didn't they call? They were too afraid Lemmy in
	particular explained. Larry cooperated with whatever little task,
	like handing the ropes, but was otherwise elsewhere in mindset until
	he saw a shooting star seem to emerge from the center of the town
	and blast out of the city, soon just a distant twinkle.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Eldstar
	would be late for the first time in eons. He put aside all
	reservations and forced himself off his throne. He&rsquo;d leave a
	note. Now where was the pen? His grey mustache kept twitching as he
	searched high and low, clearing dust bunnies. Those &lsquo;others&rsquo;
	had found a way to mess with him, but who and where? All he knew,
	his power was being tapped.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With
	great detail and conviction, all of Mushroomy background could
	explain that he primarily worked to keep the world in balance by
	imparting his power. There is a caveat. There is perpetual struggle
	within the celestial barriers. The reason why stars fall, or even
	die. This remains shrouded from other realms for their protection,
	to not even expose them to that of which only leads to destruction.
	Eldstar detested such conflict, but as the epitome of fairness those
	unsightly realities had their place on the board, the image
	incomplete without the unquestionable presence of all stars of all
	dispositions.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Did that
	make any sense? </font>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He wasn&rsquo;t

	<p><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~BREAKING
	NEWS!!! Approximately this afternoon our princess&rsquo;s servants
	were attacked in her absence by renegade &lsquo;Zoo S. Diddley&rsquo;.
	The castle is in total ruins. Two toads are unaccounted for, beloved
	Chanslor Toadsworth and an unknown steward. Multiple toads injured,
	and one very serious. Luigi Mario and his team vanquished Zoo from
	town. It&rsquo;s suspected he and his conspirators known as &lsquo;Sam
	and Slam&rsquo; may have been behind the latest epidemic- and the
	influx of off duty Koopa Troop homicides on our streets~</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">
	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Working
	in the dark, as the Press was closed now, red haired human languidly
	purged the dark boo's belongings into a white garbage bag.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Too..
	reads like a scattered synopsis, doll,&quot; her boss lowered the
	rough draft from his face. &quot;How long you been here?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Since
	the 00s.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Steve
	shook his body exasperatedly. &quot;Hm. You know better then. Erase
	the part about the koopa scum. Say a Mario brother instead of Luigi.
	See? Emphasize the MARIO. What brought you anyway? Always meant to
	ask. Don't see too many humans..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Because
	they tend to be unwillingly warped here, kinda like their 'gods' the
	Mario Bros. She didn't have super human abilities nor a coincidental
	run in with the princess leading to a decades long partnership, so
	she wound up here, a receptionist to anthropomorphs and else, like
	the talking bullet bill hovering around her. She starting to miss
	Mitch despite his hot kingdom takes, usually keeping her company
	late into the evening and also Steve at bay.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jessie
	hesitated with a small painting Zoo owned. By artist 'Drew L. D.',
	it was titled &quot;Assemblation&quot; - a bunch of random colors
	spiraling. Too bad it'd be given up to Snifit Patrol, who classed
	the belonging as 'evidence'.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The way
	everyone gathered around his phone reading the latest Toad Town
	bulletin reminded Larry Koopa of his current freshman year.
	Considered antisocial by the administration of Badlands High, his
	milking incited brawls, fragmented cliques, and triggered
	after-school warfare. Hold fire! He was just the messenger. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	fifteen year old lingered above deck to watch the trainwreck unfold.
	How would Ludwig shroud their mishaps? Disappointingly Larry
	discerned an easy out for Luddy. They had scapegoats, acknowledged
	by the news media&rsquo;s coverage. Bowser orbiters, not soldiers,
	easily distanced from. That only left explaining why they were in
	possession of Toadsworth..</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	mistook him for my grandpa and we abducted him. Done,&rdquo; Emery
	answered, also annoyingly sticking around.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He had to
	stop thinking out loud.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Anyway,
	I meet the fitness requirements, General. I airlifted. Do you know
	how heavy patients are these days?&rdquo; She blabbered over the
	shoulder of the vessel&rsquo;s captain. &ldquo;..Hello? Well when I
	bring it up to King, I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll get me trained on
	the artillery. I&rsquo;ve always dreamed of blowing stuff up&hellip;&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig&rsquo;s
	eye twitched, aggravated enough from the daunting task of navigating
	their humongous doomship, a symbol of evil and oppression to
	Mushroomites, through Toad Town&rsquo;s dark evening skies. Their
	destination was going to be the park, as traditional, quiet, and
	family friendly as it went. Maybe so, but because it was usually
	vacant Larry knew. According to online friends, everyone under the
	age of 65 ignored it and its high grass, mosquitoes, and creepy
	statues in favor of malls and clubs. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
	are you so worried about? I&rsquo;m King&rsquo;s best weapon. If
	we&rsquo;re spotted I&rsquo;ll have another excuse!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	whipped around and snapped &ldquo;-You may smarm a witless citizen,
	Miss Toady, but I doubt the princess and Mario.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
	can&rsquo;t tell me anything! Mario even quit today, King texted me
	earlier, so all of this hero villain stuff isn&rsquo;t his business
	anymore.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He stared
	blankly. &ldquo;Emery, am I being toyed with?!&rdquo; He shook
	himself out of it. &ldquo;Implausible. General Larry, please
	verify.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
	swiped around the message boards. &ldquo;&hellip;People were moaning
	and groning online about how Luigi will be in the news now. That
	doesn't prove nothing!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A smirk
	was etched on his brilliant face. &ldquo;Negatory. We are not
	amateurs are we? The Mushroomites reverence of Mario Mario is so
	great, they would never question his heroic integrity or status
	wantonly. So ein mist. It was obvious. Mario, not a politician, was
	a major proponent in the Peace Pact. Why? To prepare his kingdom for
	his retirement. Therefore&hellip;&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry&rsquo;s
	stomach dropped. &ldquo;Oh no.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-There
	will be no one in position to stop our father, who will
	unquestionably be on board with us, no pun intended, once I present
	my scheme in a delectably different light.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	younger brother staggered backwards. &quot;Y-you can't be freaking
	serious!&quot; Impulsively he bolted down the observation deck, so
	blindly he forgot a third of the ship was ripped off. His feet
	screeched to a stop on the jagged edge. Looking down he saw the city
	hundreds of feet below, wavering as vertigo hit.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hands of
	a toad girl latched to his shell, pulling him back.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Don't
	be a baby! Come on.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thanks,
	but he still hated her, hopelessly grappling as she dragged him
	back. While Ludwig had a consultation with everyone conscious to
	hear it, she managed to push him below deck and secure the door with
	a spare oar. Lemmy noticed this, his face dropping.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	like your new plan, but was that necessary?&rdquo; he fumed. &ldquo;..And
	I just thought of something. I know we aren&rsquo;t worrying about
	Mario, but what about Luigi?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">In a
	private spot in Dr. Toadley&rsquo;s clinic, the lights were dimmed
	once the beeps and blips of the computers monitoring the body grew
	steady. X-ray scans were resoundingly normal, leaving the scar and
	the shock Luigi was in the only proof anything ever happened. He was
	on involuntary bed rest for twenty-four hours minimum. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Feeling
	better? Just a bit?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Mmfm.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So no, he
	likely meant. Mario felt even worse. He was going to be alone here
	when he left.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi and
	Boo weren't around because Mario made it so for their protection.
	Peach castle attacks wasn't unheard of to residents, it was the
	eerie method and the person responsible , whose convoluted
	involvement was unexplainable without unraveling sordid details,
	screw ups and more, everything they'd been through since the game.
	All they'd kept manage to conceal was that Bowser was STILL in town
	freely and that Luigi didn't 'defeat' Zoo unscathed.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	gently sat on the bed's edge. &quot;If by any chance you hear me,
	don't worry little bro. I'm a broken record with that in my hubris,
	but this time I mean it. I think people are accepting that I can't
	control everything, friend or foe. It's not over and heck, it might
	get worse. When you spring right up from here though, you're going
	to be unstoppable, and I will guarantee that. </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
	hero with an undivided heart always is.</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He made
	the rest of it a note: Mushroom Flu- Read Luigi. Long ago, after all
	of Bowser's cupbears were run through, his in-house doc discovered
	the containment in food, like now. Only a stateless human doctor was
	willing to help. Doc might have notes on it. Couldn't get a name. We
	can discuss later.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	pulled the white covers up to his brother's neck and was out of
	there, bumping into a very impatient guest out in the lobby. Dr.
	Toadley allowed the red plumber to borrow some power tools, or
	whatever was close enough, and slap a couple of repairs on the Mach
	Bike. It was ready to go for him and-</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	handed over his hacked up helmet creation.. &quot;Wear this so you
	don't crack your skull open. Now where to?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Huffing
	derisively, Bowser tried the basic white commuter style headgear on.
	It was snug over his fat head, but the spots carved out for his
	horns lined up fine, and Mario was inwardly a little too proud of
	his guess work. &quot;The park.. Since when do I need a stupid
	helmet?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	poked his scaled chest. &quot;Since people like me make the bike
	safety statistics so scary, dummy. Didn't you ask in the first
	place?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	thought cha would whip up a cool one! -Uhg.. Thanks.. I guess!&quot;
	he groaned teasingly. His calloused hands slid across the nape of
	Mario's neck, settling on the shoulder opposite to him with a
	slightly heavy if thrilling weight. &quot;But seriously. Thanks. You
	could have had me in a pillory five times over by now, but you
	believed me right off.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	ignored the flash of heat on his face. Why his touch was psyching
	him out so much.. &quot;No problem.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Since
	when you can do that mechanic junk by the way? Forgot you're so
	handy!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Since
	always, not that you'd see it much. Heh. I'm not gonna repair enemy

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That odd
	interaction over, they took a longer, bumpier, secluded route to the
	destination. Away from so many lamps, the stars and constellations
	stuck out, even though the fuchsia hadn't faded from the horizon.
	Mario remembered them regularly appearing so vast and staggeringly
	impressive years ago, before gradually losing it's luster. Now he
	was realizing what had actually changed during that time.</font></p>

	Flower Lane,&quot; he voice commanded. The screen brought up an

	from MK East Hospital.</font></p>
	<p><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">*Beep*
	&quot;This is Nass Toad, head nurse and secretary of Dr. Prof.

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Just what
	he needed to prosecute the hospital for conspiracy. If that easy,
	why was Mitch sending him that relentless pinging sensation, like
	telepathically drilling into the back of his brain? Unable to get
	Agent 999, the aforementioned friend to back him up, he had to
	settle for the only other friend at HQ that wouldn't rat to N that
	he was back in town. 0069, recruited five spots after him.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;~Whatup,

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Meet

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Meanwhile,
	Kylie Koopa snapped a latch to crawl into the cabin from the trunk.
	So he had a secret mission? She did too, and Mitch was their common
	denominator. Jelectro calmly adjusted his mirror, making eye, she
	supposed, contact, because he abruptly accelerated, pinning Kylie
	against the seats No matter. He'd have to stop or slow down
	eventually, if due to those Snifit Patrol speed traps, the people he
	would try to defer half the case to.</font></p>

	Dr. Prof. held open his office door for Probabilly Koopa, hissing as

	this morning with his 'MKDCU' gang.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">True to
	his word, Probabilly made the facility like new in a 'jiffy'. He'd
	cleaned, fixed the entrance doors, and even the wobbly furniture.
	Dr. Prof. had other issues anyway. Since expunging Mario and co, the
	competence of his doctors plunged deeper than the Underwhere. He
	could twirl his fingers in front of some of them without reaction.
	Fortunately for him, he needed no assistance for operation room one.
	Before him on the table was a huge lump under a blue towel. The
	koopa got suited and gloved up.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Patient:
	Male. Pianta. 57. Name, so and so... He glossed over the chart, too
	old a habit to drop, though the information didn't matter for this
	Mushroom Flu patient experiment. So he dropped it, ticklish as he
	was reminded of the arcane sciences he used to dabble in in the

	his green shell turned as Peach showed up in their lobby. They
	always come back... Upon request, Mariam electronically transferred
	the records of Ala-Gold to the South hospital. When she left with a
	blue and pink toad, one lingered behind.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Excuse

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mariam

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Pitifully

	to Toadette. She smiled to the receptionist before catching up.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Prof.
	casually asked for that pad. She was so heavy handed as usual, he
	saw the imprint of 'Mitch Jamerson Toad' on next note. Mariam
	misremembered, or was going stupid like the rest finally. Mitch's
	connection was being 'banned' from Peach Castle. He messed with
	peoples...</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ah. Dr.
	Prof. decisively left the office. Menial work WAS worth it
	sometimes..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...<br/>
Toadette
	rushed outside to board the bus-like shuttle driven by Sergeant
	Howie, officer #2 of Snifit Patrol, uncharacteristically allowed to
	escort them around. She was embarrassed enough over flooding the
	Birthday kart, and not realizing that Peach's at the time floating
	castle was blocking the cell towers, making her ranting at
	YoshiMobile useless, so she just wanted to do something right for
	once. For Peach to believe she was precocious again. ..Or look at
	her, cup her face and simply go 'job well done, dear'. That would be
	acceptable too.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Here
	it is, princess.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
	examined the note, paling and unsubtly not letting Toadette see what
	that nurse wrote She almost wished she'd peeped. &quot;No. That is
	someone unrelated.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Darn.
	Toadette slumped beside Bucken-Berry in the same row, glued to the
	window as they zipped around town, about as freaked out.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The whomp
	driver placed down his radio receiver. &quot;Inspector Douglas got
	an anonymous tip. The missing toads have been found!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	princess jumped up and joined him on the bench. &quot;Thank the
	stars!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
	wrapped her arms around her boyfriend. &quot;Yes!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He kept
	his forehead against glass, staring at his faint reflection. &quot;If
	we got Toadsworth and Thomas right now, we'd still be missing a
	toad, baby..&quot;</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jelectro
	skidded behind MK East hospital, running onto the curb and bouncing
	onto the lawn in between the dumpsters. It was pitch black and next
	Kylie knew, she was thrown around, bashing her face against the
	middle console.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	pursuing officer they'd picked up along the way parked behind them,
	blowing a loud whistle. &quot;This is Snifit Patrol. Stop!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jelectro
	eased himself out, flashing his own agency's badge. &quot;You waste
	your time, mon ami. Madame might warrant your attention however. No
	seat belt.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	spat out a tooth and glared from inside the luxury car. &quot;No,
	that noki ditched me! ..Well I did climb in his trunk but...&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Snifit
	Patrol enthusiastically pulled out a thick ticket book. &quot;Tell
	me more!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">As Kylie
	tried to avoid incriminating herself further, a purple bandit
	sporting fancy black Air Koopa sneakers and a boombox jaywalked onto
	the scene. He got close and deliberately blasted hip hop,
	distracting and drawing away the snufit. Jelectro winked at Kylie
	and tossed her his keys.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;It's
	all yours.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;So
	you can frame me for grand theft?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Only
	if you conceal it from me. Or auction off parts. As it stands, that
	is your insurance that we'll have to rendezvous soon. Oui?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	hopped in, stalled for a second before muscle memory from her dad's
	old farm kicked in, and soon tore down Starman lane. Snifit Patrol
	terminated the pursuit quickly. He knew he wouldn't win. Or he was
	following that large, Bowser ship shaped, shadow moving around town.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The flags
	that survived were raised as Ludwig rode low and slow, creating a
	perfect view of their invasion. As easy as he located Toad Town
	park, lit by tiny mushroom shaped lights on the walking paths, his
	best landing attempt lopped off the head of a statue, crushed a
	jungle gym, and tipped over all portable toilets.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The Koopa
	King watching the entire thing was glad that was all they broke. As
	the dirt cloud cleared, he stomped alongside the hull and strained
	to examine every broken rivet. His eyes bulged at the extent of the
	damage, especially since it wasn't from this landing.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Vater,
	we were buffeted by a severe storm on the way, precipitation, a
	tornado, hail.. Other things.. It soars acceptably, I assure you!
	Additionally we are familiar with all events today. No need to
	recount.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	grumpily walked forward, forcing Ludwig and Lemmy to split. &quot;Good,
	cause I wasn't in the mood.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario in
	the darker fighterfly filled background caught Ludwig and Lemmy
	glancing at each other, mischievously. Iffy as it was starting to
	look, their presence was slapping him out of it. He rolled the bike
	over, introducing himself.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hey
	kids.. Both of you are how old already? Wow. I remember when you
	were crawling and..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Totally..
	Time files, ha ha,&quot; Lemmy said, bothering to chat back, unlike
	his brother. &quot;Can we wait a bit before takeoff? Think there's
	another storm on the coast.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	stood the bike. &quot;No worries. I'll watch for trouble.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;And
	I'll be on deck..&quot; From slightly farther away than they all
	thought Bowser would be listening, he climbed aboard via a bottom
	hatch, Ludwig trailing.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A moment
	later Peach gasped. The shuttle had arrived unannounced. Though she
	calmed over the warship, she behaved like Mario was invisible. &quot;We
	received a tip that our toads are here. Is there a mistake?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No,
	we DID. Come on!&quot; Lemmy kindly offered his hand.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	fought against interjecting there. Why wasn't he told? Just as he
	was about to follow Peach and Toadette, like it or not, Bucken-Berry
	crossed his path.<br/>
&quot;Mr. Mario, can we talk about
	something?&quot;</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The noki
	adopted a wandering tourist act and traversed the West ring,
	updating Agent 0069 with his smart watch. Upon reaching Room 26 he
	was greeted by Mitch's middle aged, tanned, slightly bloated, face.
	He had beady black eyes like his own, only mildly glazed from
	painkillers, vitriolic, and thick graying downturned eyebrows.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Why.
	Didn't. You. Catch. Him?? Did I not give you enough info?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;He's
	a boo, full blooded or not.&quot; Jelectro came right up on him,
	undaunted. &quot;And you shared too much information, like what
	you'd like to do to him if not for the age-gap. Bleh!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh,
	shut up. That was before he paralyzed me. He'll be back some way or
	another, but never mind. That sow, Peach asked for extra security
	and they'll be here any minute. Big mistake. Dr. Prof. will purge
	and get away scott free, like she did.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jelectro
	shifted his weight uncomfortably. &quot;What is this nonsense?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Toads
	had to be 'pure' once. Know how messed up that is? How is she
	related to Toadsworth then? Course it was a secret until I revealed
	it way back. Look, I know she's gradually changed stuff but, ha, I
	know what she's stock from. Really, everything here is built on so
	many lies, I've never even gotten to the bottom of it, dude..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Gripping
	the door handle, Dr. Professor paused outside, speaking what the
	noki was thinking. &quot;I don't think this was worth the hold up,
	and I'm doubting everything.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;It's
	legit. Lemme put ya on hold.&quot; The bandit agent dropped the
	phone from the rooftop workstation to text Jelectro for an answer.
	His boombox was on the opposite side of the helipads, currently
	occupying the ems workers as they danced to the drill beats. &quot;Tell
	ya what. We'll give you twenty-thou if you stop what chu doin and-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Goodbye
	prankster.&quot; Dr. Professor hung up and entered room 26. Hand on
	chin, he verified the vitals on the monitors, cross checking with a
	clipboard.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jelectro
	spied from the closet, behind bundles of white towels. The doctor
	cleared his throat. &quot;Mr. Mitch, how about I perform your
	scheduled operations tonight? Alright? Alright.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">When he
	edited Mitch's procedure chart to have 'Lobotomy', that was all
	Jelectro needed to jump out and blindsid the doctor, slamming him
	into the wall. The bump knocked tacked papers to the ground.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	am Detective Bond and you are under arrest for conspiracy, bribery,
	and unlawful procedures. Hands up!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Doctor
	Professor shot his arms upwards.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
	accepted a deal from a scoundrel posing as another hospital Why?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	doctor's visage contorted into a self satisfied smile. &quot;My,
	what are the odds of meeting two magikoopa-like-freaks in a day,
	boy? If you can't pick it from my brain, give up. I can wait aaaall
	day. Can you?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jelectro
	checked his watch. About that..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	intercom screeched for a moment, filled with static and distant
	screams from some conflict happening in the lobby. &quot;We have
	another invasion! All doctors on guard!&quot; Nass blared.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The stomp
	of heavy boots bounced off the hall outside. While his head was
	turned, the doctor slipped out of Jelectro's grip, wasting not one
	second to hurl himself shell first against the glass and out the
	window to escape. Baffled, the noki peered outside. He shuddered at
	the dark outlines, armored vehicles of the burly Mushroom Royal
	squad surrounding the hospital.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Under
	the bed, dude!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jelectro
	rushed to prop the door closed with a steel fold out chair that was
	down there. That is what he meant wasn't it. A half second later,
	there was a heavy thunk as a guard failed to kick it in. The noki
	backed away.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No,
	you coulda hid. They don't have poochys with em- oh forget.. Unprop
	it again on one. The elevator will be clear. Good luck. Don't die.
	Now swing it open in five.. Four...&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">On 'one'
	Jelectro pulled the chair away, allowing three guards to charge in
	and trip over each other. Jelectro climbed over the pile up and
	found the way clear as Mitch cued. He rode up three floors to the
	helipads and found 0069 peering over the edge of the parapet.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Screw
	that money, 0064. I'm outta here.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Andrew
	was 'gangsta' enough to jump without scaling gear. He was HQ's
	street guy for a reason. Jelectro wasn't though, call it vanity to
	protect his pretty face, or call it him hearing the crunch of the
	bandit a few seconds later. He let the black spotted, armor wearing
	toads get him with no worries. He'd broken out of the local jail
	countless times. His sunglasses were taken, and he saw the writing
	on the tanks better. The noki worried then.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
	was eager to break free from the cramped spiral staircase leading up
	the airship&rsquo;s four decks. She kept on Peach&rsquo;s heels
	until, muffled by thick walls, she thought she heard someone
	cackling. She had it. She would beg Peach to go back, stop being
	prickly and just send Mario in. Just as a friend, not a hero thing.
	She ran out of time. The observation deck was in appalling
	condition. Debris was hurled everywhere, the ship had no sails left,
	and the floorboards had treacherous gaps to avoid. The poor
	condition ran all the way to the control panels at the helm. Bowser,
	Ludwig, and Kamek, with much grumbling involved, were busy tinkering
	with sparkling wires sprouting from the tarnished metal boxes.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
	looked to her left. The princess was missing! Her palpitations
	resided. Peach had traveled with familiarity to a rusty compartment
	door leading deeper into the ship where Wendy stood around. The
	koopaling princess pushed it open, bored like. Out came a young
	toad, orange, dorky, and sorta cute, also in a wrinkled nurse
	outfit.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Nass
	Toad's daughter? You joined my castle today?&quot; Peach asked.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Emery did
	a curtsy. &quot;Yep!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
	obviously had much more to inquire about, considering her other
	staff purported that the new recruit was 'male', but she had to
	press another matter. &quot;And Toadsworth?&quot;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His
	case is kinda sensitive. Some privacy?&rdquo; Lemmy made Toadette
	jump. &ldquo;Maybe wait off board.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	so-called childish koopaling towered over her while on his green
	ball and ran her off deck, back into the spooky spiral staircase.
	She protested as the door slammed shut in her face. She pulled on
	the handle. It didn&rsquo;t bulge. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario led
	the blue toad off to the wooden picnic tables, keeping within view
	of the airship. Bucken-Berry was, with no embellishment, his bravest
	warrior in adventures, his biggest fan, and in general not a typical
	blue toad. Now he sat across from him, the flame behind his eyes
	gone.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;What
	happened at the castle's not your fault.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He wiped
	his nose with his sleeve. &quot;You know how my origin story goes. I
	was a sole survivor in Toadwood Forest, so while in orphanage, I
	thought- this has to mean something. -Or I going to make it mean
	something. I already survived that alien stuff, so if I train and
	get strong enough, not only would I survive more impossible stuff,
	I'd never lose anyone again. I was still a kid then. I know that's
	not realistic, but.. they were saying Ala-Gold has serious brain
	damage. This might have been my last day with him around, and I was
	a complete dick. Nothing I did mattered far as the other stuff. Why
	am I still doing this?&quot;</font></p>

	held his shoulder firmly. &quot;Bucken-Berry, the things you love
	</font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">will
	hurt</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">
	at some point. Fearing failure doesn't mean you should quit.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The blue
	toad looked at him frankly. &quot;But why did you?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario let
	go, rattled enough to divert to the black jagged outline of the
	airship, detecting his own tears welling up.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;It
	wasn't what you wanted to do...?&quot; Bucken-Berry then tacked on,
	the red plumber's actual name few knew.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario's
	gaze snapped back. &quot;..It's technically never what I wanted to
	do. It was what someone needed to do. We still need that. So,
	whatever you decide, be sure about it.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
	squinted as someone in the park shined a dazzlingly bright torch all
	over. The beam settled on their picnic table, like a figure of
	authority catching rascally teens at night. The red plumber supposed
	their moment just then was 'intimate', but not like that..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Panting,
	Snifit Patrol lowered the beam. &quot;I was tracking that airship
	all over town, I even let my quota drop to keep up.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;In
	peace, Sumeet. Now could you please..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Peace?
	Mr. Mario, they had their Bowser Flag raised the entire time!&quot;</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Noooo!&quot;
	Peach dropped to her knees before Toadsworth's bruised, bloodied,
	and unconscious body. A tattered Bowser Flag was draped over him, as
	if symbolically claiming that the Koopa Troop, fractured as it was,
	succeeded in claiming him. She was in a terrible position, and she
	placed herself there!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;That
	was my touch. I'm Bowser's new toad actually!&quot; Emery didn't
	know why she hadn't done this sooner. Watching Peach squirm was fun.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Do
	not get ahead Miss Toady, but affirmative, she contributed greatly,
	one of our many pawns as we terrorized you and your society all
	day!&quot; Ludwig declared maniacally, looming over the princess.
	&quot;No here's a synopsis as scattered as your plebeian newspapers.
	Sam and Slam drove into town to infect the participants of your
	tennis game. The Koopa Troop thus take full responsibility for the
	tragedies of today: the rapid illness of your friends, the mushroom
	citizens, AND the destruction of your hideous castle! Say good bye
	to your backwards kingdom, because you WILL come with us.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	whipped around so quickly the wheel spun, rotating the ship on the
	ground and into adjacent trees. &quot;What??&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	gave a salute. &quot;Vater, I concocted this scheme for your central
	purpose. (Mostly) Forget go-karting with that Mario. The princess is
	just. Right. There!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No, not
	anymore. Peach jumped into the part of the ship torn off, knowing
	she'd land in an open room with bench seating. She dashed out and
	down a deck, into a cramped corridor for ammo storage. It had
	occupants among the cannons lining the walls, like unsightly things
	stuffed away, demented koopalings, spinning in place, laughing,
	drooling.. Pale, she turned back, losing her footing when abrupt
	g-forces knocked her around and threw her against the nearest
	porthole- and into Toadette's screaming face on the other side. The
	airship lifting launched the steward out of the stair shaft and
	outside, where she clung to the flapped open exit door for dear
	life.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach
	spotted a rivet tool hung up in the room for the barrels within.
	Clash! The princess shielded herself amidst the shower of glass
	shards. She brushed off the cuts on her arms and lunged half her
	body out, dropping her personal items to do so. Their hands graced
	for a fraction of a second. Breathlessly she watched her toad
	plunge.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Thank
	the stars.. Mario and her guard Bucken-Berry were directly below.
	She could scope out the entire park though with their altitude. A
	sudden roll stopped her thoughts, the barrels about to crush her.
	Someone tugged her out of the way before she was pinned. She tumbled
	into a koopaling, Larry. She barely registered it, leaping onto her
	feet again and running down a corridor. He stopped her again.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Give
	it up,&quot; he muttered.</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Low to
	the ground, the fiery blasts from the engines held them at bay. As
	the ship rose with difficulty, it was safe to gather beneath. Mario
	pointed to a pink toad hanging precariously from an unsecured ground
	level door. The decrepit Doomship had an ear piercing backfire and
	shook the person off.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bucken-Berry
	dove forward and caught Toadette before she spat on the ground. She
	continued to hyperventilate in his sturdy grasp as he repeated,
	&quot;Baby, I got you..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Peach's
	parcel plummeted as well, shedding its contents in the sky, her
	white papers like confetti around the city block. Snifit Patrol
	commanded his sergeant to collect whatever they were, and then
	opened a metal gun case with a super scope in it.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No!&quot;
	The plumber shut it with his boot. &quot;That type of ship explodes
	very easy. I'll do something else.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He tried
	to call Bowser. That's how it started, it's how it would end if he
	could swipe his pattern lock with his nerves. It took ten tries. The
	lawn sprinkler system had cut on next to him and he hadn't noticed
	until the wind hit his drenched body.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Then the
	phone rang him first.</font></p>

	I wasn&rsquo;t tryina.. once ya hit the TO/GA button, you can&rsquo;t
	stop&hellip; yeah yeah It&rsquo;s super old tech whatcha gonna do
	about..What?? We&rsquo;re hitting some clouds. Gotta go, can&rsquo;t
	hear ya.&rdquo; The Koopa King shut his dumbphone. A bead of sweat
	rolled off his forehead onto the barrage of controls in front of
	him, a high voltage wire left exposed from their patch-up job
	sparking a few times before another fuse popped.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kamek, co
	navigator, reset the circuit, glaring warily at his step-son. &ldquo;Why
	waste time with that pest, Lord Bowser?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lay
	off, gramps. I got this&hellip; Get!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Following
	the northerly pointed needle on the compass, Bowser cruised along.
	There were no markers anywhere, only the glint of water bodies as
	they sailed over sparsely populated kingdoms, tantamount to flying
	in a void at moments. He&rsquo;d coaxed the airship to be steady,
	but the Koopa King felt his stomach churn despite that. Fresher air
	away from the cities really let him reflect. It smacked him bluntly
	that an impulsive primitive side got him to this point, running off
	with captives after breaking a sworn oath. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Or.. like
	his eldest son, he could play the plausible deniability game! He
	stopped slumping for the first time. Peach was tucked away somewhere
	in the maze-like layout, so they just didn&rsquo;t see her onboard
	until they&rsquo;d crossed the six kingdoms between the Mushroom
	Kingdom and Dark Land. What if he did go through with it? His union
	with Peach wouldn't &lsquo;mean&rsquo; anything, it was just part of
	tyranny. Bowser could cure her citizens too since that part of the
	scheme was already fulfilled. See? He wasn't heartless. Once he made
	her kingdom and her allies fold under his will, he and that plumber
	would be free to do whatever they wanted.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There,
	everything WAS under control!</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That high
	wore off with the sheer uneventfulness of the rest of the journey.
	Bowser was half asleep crossing his kingdom&rsquo;s border. Was his
	castle not the sole structure on the property for acres, he might
	have missed it honestly. He only fully awoke after the rough touch
	down and forty degree roll, followed by the stampede of occupants
	hopping overboard. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Stop
	stop stop!!&rdquo; From the railings he watched one by one their
	spiked shells tremble, yards away from the castle's back door.
	&ldquo;Forgetting something???&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After an
	arduous search they weren&rsquo;t, repossessing Peach from her
	pantry hiding spot. How she&rsquo;d discovered a section of the
	doomship even they&rsquo;d forgotten about, they didn&rsquo;t know.
	Wendy and Lemmy together took her in, typically reserved for Roy or
	Morton, but they were &lsquo;feeling better, but still not well&rsquo;
	along with Iggy. Upon asking why, lips sealed. The princess wailed
	the entire time, putting on a show that would have attracted a crowd
	at any other hour in their stone castle corridors, gratingly wishing
	for the stars to save her. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Walking
	alongside as she was escorted to her deluxe holding room, Bowser
	stuffed his ears. That was the problem with them, sitting around
	waiting for providence to do it all! Everything handed over on
	silver platters! At least Toadsworth was tolerable, his barely
	conscious body carried down to the dungeon without incident..</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Please
	hire a professional planner for once, Vater. I shall elaborate in
	due time, but I fear I may be unable to conduct the orchestra.&quot;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	didn&rsquo;t want cha to.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Excuse
	me??&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	love your tunes but who wants a migraine on their wedding day?? If I
	really do this thing...&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	marched up and down the red carpeted stone corridors. Prisoners were
	secured, their family were scattered about, likely rummaging in a
	kitchen, and his Troop, aside from dedicated watchers, were settled
	in bed if they knew what was good for them. Father and son had no
	destination at the moment, simply a shared or inherited habit of
	pacing aimlessly. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
	cannot hold the princess for very long without a formal decision,&rdquo;
	Ludwig replied vaguely. &ldquo;Why do you dither?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Because!&rdquo;
	Bowser paused and huffed coincidentally at the dusty lapis lazuli
	bust of his brother, the fleshly version of him unseen since the
	assassination of father King Morton. His departure was so ill-timed
	and repugnant, no one dared to utter his name anymore. &ldquo;Just
	lemme figure it out. I&rsquo;ll have an answer by tomorrow, okay??
	Why Mushroom Flu anyway? Was it just to scare them or..&rdquo; he
	trailed.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	benignly planted himself at the other side of the seven foot tall
	structure. &ldquo;A tool to force submission firstly, and to
	establish a ransome arrangement, that is if the princess did not
	voluntarily place herself in our clutches. I discovered detailed
	notes on it while cleaning out old chests and filed it away until a
	time when I needed to transcend our basic kidnapping plots.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And
	why did ya?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">To
	impress the&hellip; never mind, I beg. It is purposeless to enmesh
	you or anyone else when nothing is solidified,&rdquo; he explained
	stiffly. &ldquo;By the way, the author of the notebook was Dr.
	Mario.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His
	father stared blankly. Ludwig followed his gaze to the opposite wall
	of the hall, where dozens of hand painted portraits of notable
	Darklandian figures were hung. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...Vater?
	There is no relevance to your rival. &lsquo;Mario&rsquo; is a
	surname.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Still
	nothing.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	estimated he could be staring intensely at Princess Keuxis reigning
	50 B.C.E to only 35, primadonna who conscripted soldiers for stage
	plays, dying from laughter at their abominable acting skills. Or
	Keschylus 1604 to 1612, his reign terminating when a paratroopa made
	an emergency landing- on his head. That didn&rsquo;t bode well&hellip;
	Or glutinous Koopa A. Frederick, king from 1300 to 1336, whose
	digestive system failed after too many.. mushrooms.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...Vater!!&rdquo;
	His echo bounced around the room.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	snapped his way. &ldquo;G-good night. Alright?...Get!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	saluted and left him to trek to his bedroom alone. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A sentry
	hovered outside the giant iron throne room door, a lakitu with
	balaclava atop a darkened cloud. &ldquo;Sentry #11 reporting. Your
	time cards are in order now. We&rsquo;ve accounted for all minions
	that deserted this morning, deceased or not. We can send undercover
	goons to recover the bodies by 00:40 in the morning. We haven&rsquo;t
	yet nailed the freak responsible, but we made sure he ain&rsquo;t
	returning home, boss..&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	groggily nodded along. &ldquo;For security, lift both bridges
	tonight. That&rsquo;s an order.&rdquo; He brushed past him, eager to
	jump in bed.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
	spoofed an instant message from one of Kammy&rsquo;s girlfriends to
	draw the crone away from the special room. Designated for holding
	princesses, it differed from the dungeons in that it had a real bed
	with a canopy, a vanity set, and a barred window with a great view
	of all of the lava outdoors. He tip-toeed around in the warm candle
	light, evading the usual tattletales stationed around his royal
	home. After peeking around the last corner before the staircase that
	led up the spire, he ducked back-</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The girl
	cupped her hand over her mouth. &ldquo;Tanner, right? Dude, you
	won&rsquo;t report that?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Pro
	tip: We don&rsquo;t tell King Bowser </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">every</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">
	little thing. When somebody&rsquo;s wanted for &lsquo;questioning&rsquo;
	it really means-&rdquo; The gangly koopatrol did a chopping gesture
	across his exposed tanned neck. &ldquo;This guy is outta this world.
	He&rsquo;s like the best illusionist, only better because it&rsquo;s
	real. He&rsquo;s just hiding for tonight at so and so..&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yeah
	well I was smack in Toad Town all day. He tenderized a bunch of
	people&rsquo;s brains!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Wait
	how many?..O-oh, jeez. I didn&rsquo;t know he got into that much
	trouble..&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
	kneeled over, nauseated overhearing them talk about the guy the
	Troop were hunting for tonight, burning down his cabin in the
	village next door over in the process. Larry could spill this new
	intel and rebuild his sullied reputation, but heck-to-the-no!! The
	janitor had done some bad things to their soldiers unabashedly, but
	by destroying the castle and displacing the princess he was
	blatantly the only reason his brother could salvage the kidnap. To
	him it was no different than when the koopalings were tasked to
	throw hoards of baddies at the Mario Bros on any given day, knowing
	full well some might not make it back. No one was mourning losses.
	The acceptance of collateral was so ingrained in their culture, the
	real problem the Troop, specifically Ludwig, had with that guy was
	revolting.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Tanner
	continued, &ldquo;Oh I forgot ha ha.. here.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Emery
	accepted the travel voucher, blushing. &quot;Thanks. Yeah, enough of
	that stuff. I can stay anywhere in Neo Bowser City with this?&quot;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">If
	not owned by the warlords, totally. My friend and I did it a lot
	before I was promoted full time. Ha ha..&quot;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Attention
	please, this is a secured area UNFIT for tours on behalf of
	uninitiated operatives such as Miss Toady!&rdquo; Ludwig ran up on
	both with an electronic torch illuminating their stunned faces.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
	cursed silently. Ludwig had already pardoned his earlier rebellion
	in exchange for his computer. Another infraction might take away
	something else dear, like his headphones. He backed off, for then..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Meanwhile.
	Tanner saluted, letting his spear clash to the ground in a klutzy
	manner.. &ldquo;Sir! Sorry for breaching a sector.. I umm, got
	carried away welcoming our guest into the troop and providing
	accommodation in the city.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	mellowed somewhat. That saved him from the tears that would likely
	erupt from her if he disclosed that the castle had no vacancy
	outside the dungeons and Junior&rsquo;s empty pet pens. &ldquo;Very
	well. Good night.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	commander entered his sanctuary, plopped down at his writing desk,
	twiddled his gold pen, and crossed one leg over the other. The
	journal destined to contain his manifesto remained empty, the same
	one that had to be completed to impress the Elders of the National
	Villain Counsel. What defined &lsquo;Ludwig Von Koopa&rsquo;? What
	was his purpose? </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	decided on </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Love
	and War.</font></em></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Love: Not
	a fabrication, genuinely! -Also not of a romantic sort as he
	supposed he wasn't &lsquo;attracted&rsquo; to anyone at the moment,
	not lasciviously. Intellectually he may have crushed on a few
	professors at college, but.. So anyway familial love was real too,
	but he digressed. It was more aptly described as a passion for
	music, science, technology- also the grittier ones, history,
	politics, and social studies, leading to-</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">War: An
	ugly necessity, for there was much to fight for. As long as the
	Mushroom Kingdom held dominance, people like him had a duty to
	dismantle it. Facing his bed, so that it was the first thing he saw
	every morning, was a wall filled with his stockpile of battle
	metals, a spot in the middle cleared for what could soon hold the
	most prestigious yet if he reported his success to the Counsel. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Five
	pages in, it was time for a stretch and diversion to other projects.
	Better late than never combing over all the yellowed pages of the
	&ldquo;Ex Spatio Obiecti Specialem Lexicon&rdquo; from his library.
	The Mushoomy star centered faith was a 'speciest and nationalistic
	concept' for a certainty, but there was validity he could not deny
	in recognizing and respecting their power, as their unwitting
	utilization ranged from bizarre effects. Portals to other realms,
	reality-warping.. There was another &lsquo;R&rsquo; thing it did,
	but he&rsquo;d need to locate his bookmark on it again. After
	straining a while over small text, he remembered he had something
	else less bookish but far more conclusive to study. Iggy&rsquo;s
	video capture was saved on Larry&rsquo;s laptop!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	battery was drained. He found himself awkwardly tethered to the
	outlet behind his piano when the wide screen snapped down on his
	fingers. </font>

	Bl&ouml;der Dell X-&rsquo;POS&rsquo;&hellip;&quot; He readjusted the
	broken hinge. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	footage was fuzzy and unrecognizable. He leaned in until the
	computer buzzed and powered off. He sneezed. An influx of particles
	he dismissed as dust agitated from under the keys. A coughing fit
	overtook him as the air grew dense. No telling what crud
	Larry...This wasn&rsquo;t normal.. Something very dark and acidic
	steadily spilled from the battery compartment , pooling on top of
	his ornate rug, solidifying and clumping in spots that writhed. He
	scrambled to his feet, tripping over his bench. It covered his
	entire room now, molding over each and every shape He was surrounded
	and seared as some of it inched onto his toes.</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yippee..We

	weighs as much as a thwomp.. Help!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Two
	people close by grunted for a while. Ludwig felt something
	plush-like give under him. His crusted over eyelids cracked open and
	he lay on his made up king sized bed. Leaning up, the first
	inclination was to be quite hot witnessing his trusted adjutants
	sneaking out at 11:55 PM, but a partition of his memory was blotted
	out completely and that was far more unsettling. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The two
	koopalings continued obliviously, &ldquo;We should have used my
	Movematic2000 v.4 Alpha. Up to four tons of lift with her built-in
	gravitational distortion.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The

	swore it was just a prop! And how is that a &lsquo;she&rsquo;?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Lemmy-sama,
	because she told me herself and she'd know!&quot; Iggy giggled.
	&quot;Besides prop and nonlethal are not mutual. Mrs. Mover however
	is never dangerous- if set at less than medium power.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
	pivoted around on his ball. &ldquo;-Oh, whoops. Hey your door was
	open and you were all strung out next to this exploded thingy.&rdquo;
	He dropped the corroded aluminum shell of the notebook next to
	Ludwig. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy

	shuddered in his doorway.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	will accompany you all,&rdquo; Ludwig slid out of bed, light headed.
	Maybe a Turtle Tea from the 24-hour bistro not far from there would
	help him through the rest of the night. He struggled back and forth
	on whether to turn back when, as his feet left the bridge of Bowser
	Castle, there was a loud grinding noise. The drawbridge raised
	behind him, leaving the crevice that contained lava.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It was 12

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Deep in
	the forest, under the canopy of the hardwood trees, items plunked on
	the soft dirt. The floating figure scanned the various shapes
	partially hidden under the brush the best he could, adjusting his
	glasses repeatedly as they slid downwards. If he wasn&rsquo;t so
	prone to dissipation and wasting his talents, culminating into being
	run off everytime he settled somewhere, he may have seen an
	optometrist by now. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There was
	a letter to his brother living his boring life somewhere in Special
	World, goaded on by what his father said on the back of that old
	photo. There was a map of Neo Bowser City, not living here long
	enough to know the layout. His prized antique bell was glowing in
	the corner of his eye, mildly worrisome-like. There was one other
	time when it had done that. He was a teen, used it for some sick fun
	for a spat, then some &lsquo;Evil Artifact Busters&rsquo; or
	something raided his family&rsquo;s home and said they&rsquo;d
	dispose of it off in another kingdom&hellip; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Last on
	the checklist was an envelope postmarked Bowser Castle, ATTN: 'Guard
	Tanner', containing a short message and a morbid souvenir from his
	adventures like the only friend liked so much, a Lexus emblem from a
	certain crash today. He sniffed a bit. He'd miss him for a while. Or
	miss pulling the koopatrol into trouble rather. Great (fall) guy.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Securing
	the items in a knapsack, the only thing he was able to grab before

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Three
	young adult koopalings traversed on foot through the thick brambles
	of the woodlands between them and Neo Bowser City. Ludwig
	inadvertently made it so when he siphoned all the fuel from the
	Troop&rsquo;s vehicles this morning when the minions first snuck
	off. He would suppose their plebeian method could be for stealth,
	but his brothers did not appear to be worried so-</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-We
	should get King Dad into that series! He&rsquo;ll love the locations

	much due to players memorizing their button presses and speeding
	through his levels in record times!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Quit
	that 'life is a videogame' fan-theory stuff,&quot; Lemmy laughed.
	&quot;So, you brought the credit card, right?&quot; He cautiously
	glanced over his shoulder, where Ludwig trailed grumpily and got
	whacked repeatedly by branches and twigs.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
	didn't think he would pay for such drivel, did they?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy dug
	in the backpack. &quot;I'll write a check!.. Or not because. Darn

	so thrown off since that blackout thing..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	quickly inserted himself in between them. &quot;Their work today was
	worth 500 coins. You did not deplete your account, did you Ignatius?
	Are you in competition with Wendy?!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy
	shrugged it off with equanimity. &quot;More like, I have sniffling
	friends, hahaha..'&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;We
	cannot permit that! I knew they were mendacious when they
	overcharged for services the last time. Larry's hard drive upgrade
	last month was not a terabyte NVMe module as billed, but an

	anyone but I, who reexamined the specifications tonight, before it
	malfunctioned that is, sometime before your intrusion-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Why

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
	rolled his eyes.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He sighed
	and gestured ahead in an overly dramatic way. &quot;Fine! Class is
	dismissed. There is your destination, ravaged by soporific nerds!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Deeper
	into the Badlands, territories not under KT control flourished into
	smaller villages and in this case 'respectable' modern cities.
	Play-N-Tirade was a small dome shaped shop on the street corner of
	road #673, koopas crowding into it and leaving with shopping bags.
	The chaotic city beyond it was dazzlingly lit, sky rises sprouting
	from otherwise barren red soil and armored vehicles whipping and
	gliding around tight curves.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His
	brothers slipped on oversized space helmets, Cowboy Boom Boom merch,
	to shroud their identity. Ludwig had no such preparation, and upon
	seeing the crowd he knew squeezing inside among the grease and
	various body odors and trying to confront the Sumo Bros over money
	was unideal anyway.. Since he knew where to find them another day,
	the commander bypassed the storefront, windows stuffed with lively
	colorful merch from popular video-games and shows. He covered his
	blue hair with a promotional flier, walking a block to the
	&lsquo;Eat.Drink.WiiConnect24&rsquo; shop. The pedestrians and
	migrants were rougher than he remembered, but he was armed.. He made
	it in and out with some tea. Traveling back to the game store
	someone stopped him on the slippery sidewalk.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	owner&rsquo;s in?&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	blinked a few times. &ldquo;Unaware.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	stranger wiped the rain off his glasses. During that split second
	Ludwig found them familiar. That person and entered the
	Play-N-Tirade, leaving near instantaneously and vanishing into the
	fog. Enlivened by caffeine, the commander became more aware of what
	had subtly been an irritant since waking up on his bed. It started
	with dizziness, then he saw something inside the moodily lit bistro.
	A persistent afterimage was burnt in his vision, a faint geometric
	shape, very erratic, with an uncountable amount of angles to it,
	sharp in every direction. He stopped sipping the beverage as his
	vision blacked out, as if suffering from orthostatic hypotension,
	which he was not susceptible to normally. He feared he would
	collapse in the street when-</font></p>

	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He knew
	it shouldn&rsquo;t have taken Ludwig popping off over this to get

	juggled, sometimes literally, his Troop secretary duties, his
	performances at the Emerald Circus, and what little personal time he
	had left until now. His little brother had also exuded all of his
	enthusiasm during their brawl for a copy of Princess Parlor, so now,
	despite not using his legs, he was plainly exhausted. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy.

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig&rsquo;s
	body ceased its stilted gait before what appeared to be an abandoned
	mini-fortress, imperturbably soaking wet from the storm that raged
	since Lemmy and Iggy left the shop in time to spot him wandering
	off. He would walk and not speak crossing over all terrain, and even
	a shallow stream. He went on the move again, approaching the
	entrance.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	teenager stalking the tallest spire of Bowser Castle wanted to send
	his fist through a wall. Kammy was stationed once again outside the
	deluxe holding room. When he snuck back downstairs a white light
	bled from underneath the kitchen door. Digging in the refrigerator
	secretly was impossible even for him, for this room in the center of
	the castle was minuscule, perhaps even by commoner&rsquo;s
	standards, to discourage goofing off. He poked his head in. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	see ya, son..&rdquo; Bowser kicked it shut, sipping from a glass of
	milk. His jagged shadow flickered on the wall of spices and other
	materials from the candle light.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
	dragged himself in.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hand
	this to old hag for me, then GET TO BED!!!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Cleaning
	out his ears, Larry examined the document addressed to Peach. He
	diverted swiftly to his room to grab from under his bed a pad of
	stationary that matched his father&rsquo;s. He wondered when the
	trade he&rsquo;d made with Morton for it, in exchange for a record
	player, would pay off. He was missing the correct writing utensil
	and knew where to acquire one, walking down the corridor of
	koopaling bedrooms:</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Morton&rsquo;s
	door appeared solid steel, only he knew it was actually wooden with
	mismatched plates glued on the outside. Being such, sound went right
	through it, only tonight there was none. Wendy&rsquo;s door was
	gold-trimmed smoky glass, the latest trend. One could not spy
	however, due to her layout and the various weaved dividers she
	shifted around during redecorations. Iggy&rsquo;s was skewed,
	something he meant to fix at some point, with a &lsquo;Koopa Ball Z&rsquo;
	banner taped to it. No chemical smell, so they were safe- for now.
	Roy&rsquo;s was legitimately made of dull iron too heavy for most of
	them to push, sound proof with five chains and locks shut up for the
	night. Lemmy&rsquo;s was bare and plain, almost too much, though the
	zany interior made up for it. At last, he reached Ludwig&rsquo;s
	room, with an old expertly restored bronze palace door plucked from
	the first fortress he ever conquered. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Picking
	the lock and stepping in, he blew a gasket at what was left of his
	laptop. He angrily snatched a fountain pen from the writing drawer
	and stomped out. Since the drawbridge was raised, Ludwig must be
	hanging around somewhere, ready to make his life miserable. -Okay,
	make an adjustment. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Psst,&rdquo;
	he called to Tanner, guarding the hall that lead to the stairs. When
	the koopatrol came over he whispered. &ldquo;Yo, dad made me a fetch
	boy but I&rsquo;m tired. You do it. Pass whatever I give ya on to
	granny-janny, and give me whatever she hands back. I know you know
	about a certain dark boo. I ain&rsquo;t gonna rat if you help me
	out.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	flushed. &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Shhh!!!
	Just do it.&rdquo; He shoved the rolled note into his gauntlet and
	watched the koopatrol hustle up the long spiral staircase up.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
	waited at the bottom. Beneath that bravado just then, he was about
	to suffocate, wondering if the princess would be receptive. He&rsquo;d
	copied his father&rsquo;s signature headers for formal documents,
	just in case they peeped, but in the rest of the note, written
	meticulously in cursive (as Bowser wrote contrary to popular belief.
	Proper cursive was in fact how he picked up the English language way
	back when) he told her everything he couldn&rsquo;t when he saved
	her from the barrels in the airship. Basically he vented about
	everything so far, especially how if Mario was living his &lsquo;truth&rsquo;
	with a billion people watching him, he could too.</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sir!&rdquo;
	Tanner handed over another note. It was in the thin rule paper kept
	in the holding room. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thanks.
	Whatever.&rdquo; Larry cooly strolled far enough before checking it.
	She thanked him. Called him a kind soul, knowing he had something
	like that to say when he&rsquo;d choked up earlier and cried with
	her. The stars were with her- and him. She was calm now, more
	worried for Toadsworth. She&rsquo;d dread this, suspecting Bowser
	couldn&rsquo;t change his tune even for Mario. She also told him to
	not be so rigid and think more about his principles, mystifying him.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He wrote
	back, compelled to even if it cast suspicion, and passed it to
	Tanner, hiding his sweating. The koopatrol had a flash of weariness
	before obeying the order and sending another note up the spire
	again. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Even
	quicker than last time, Tanner returned with a reply. This went on a
	few times, Larry imploring her to clarify which she refused. On the
	sixth round Tanner was worn but amiable, and Kammy&rsquo;s faint
	giggles seemed to curl down the staircase and reach them both.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well that
	was confirmation their imagination was dancing wildly at what Peach
	and &lsquo;Bowser&rsquo; might be saying. Larry flushed, more so
	when he discovered he&rsquo;d worn her down.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She said
	verbatim, </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&ldquo;You,
	dear, remind me of a point in my life where I was determined to
	evolve from the sort of &lsquo;thinking&rsquo; my predecessor had,
	only I had no precedent. I settled for &lsquo;completely opposite of
	everything I knew&rsquo;. I cannot speak for you, but for me, that
	was not the wisest choice, for I learned that that person&rsquo; in
	my life who was wrong about many things was not about everything.
	Sorting through that will take longer than one night.&rdquo;</font></em></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It was
	far past early morning now, so if he slept on it maybe he&rsquo;d
	get her point.. The koopaling swiped the junk off his bed and slid
	under the covers, hearing some paper crinkle. For fun, he brought
	out the original note from Bowser and unfolded it.</font></p>
	<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">This
	is an official declaration from King Bowser Koopa to Princess Peach
	Toadstool. I was going to wait until Junior was home from camp for
	this announcement, but it&rsquo;s no use. He can&rsquo;t read this
	anyway. They don&rsquo;t teach this style in school anymore. We both
	know that Mario forfeit his obligation to save you and Luigi is on
	the mends so, I have decided that, since you&rsquo;re stuck here
	anyway, we might as well get hitched!&rdquo;</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">

	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luddy,
	stop!! What are you-&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Their
	brother barged into the dilapidated stone structure. A scratchy low
	voice from inside yelled incoherently, a person awakening inside.
	The brothers rushed into the arch of the doorway and into the square
	concrete room, roof leaking in one corner and the person Ludwig was
	confronting in the other. Lemmy&rsquo;s jaw dropped a little,
	knowing Zoo Diddley- at least professionally. If this is what his
	brother was after, he deserved to be caught. He used their shared
	profession to get hired quickly this summer, only to turn out to be
	a mook murderer. The only source of light was a curious thing on the
	floor next to a glasses case, a bell that glowed a yellow color.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bro,
	I was leaving- I wasn&rsquo;t uh- those guys weren&rsquo;t that
	loyal to you anyway-&rdquo; the dark boo sputtered. &ldquo;Really,
	almost every one of them hated your guts. Why you think they
	skipped-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	command you to hand over the bell,&rdquo; Ludwig droned.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That's
	what this about?? No way!!!&rdquo; The boo took a deep breath,
	bridling himself. &ldquo;Listen bro. I know you&rsquo;re a rich
	prick- okay sorry, but.. It&rsquo;s the only thing left from my
	childhood home and it was stolen from me before. Last week, I dunno
	how, it just showed up in a thrift store while I was traveling. So-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	repeated the command, same cadence and all. Lemmy stared a hole in
	the back of his head, finding that material thing odious to focus
	on. A lump however formed in his throat as Ludwig reached for a
	holster on his side. He revealed a borrowed replica firearm from the
	anime show &lsquo;Cowboy Boom Boom&rsquo;.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy
	lurched forward, taking wobbly steps off his scooter., &ldquo;Careful!!!
	That&rsquo;s another one with real laser action!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Before
	the lanky nerd reached for his right arm, the &lsquo;toy&rsquo;
	triggered, blasting the wall spectacularly. Bricks crumbled,
	revealing a hole outside. Zoo fled, phasing through the walls. His
	ears rang. His left side stung severely as the rain pelted him. He
	knew he was nicked by the laser or shrapnel, stumbling around in the
	forest. He&rsquo;d mailed his letters so there should be two things
	on him now, but there was only one. He&rsquo;d left his glasses. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo
	paused at a fork in the road. Squinting, both were labeled&hellip;screw
	it, he couldn't tell.. Lemmy and Iggy kept wailing after Ludwig
	behind him. He made a choice down the right path, bumping into trees
	and getting snipped by nipper plants along the way. The rain let up
	as it led into a clearing overlooking the neighboring kingdom. The
	dark boo collapsed at the lip of the cliff. There was a long drop
	down onto the islands of Pipe Land. He was lighter again.
	Dreadfully, he knew what that meant..</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Luddy,
	son of a biscuit! First you sleepwalk for like an hour, then
	whatever you call this?!? Put that down and look at me!!&rdquo;
	Lemmy rolled up to Ludwig and forcibly spun him his way, right after
	Ludwig bent to pick up the bell. Its glow abruptly died, like a
	busted light bulb. Was that the mythical object? </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So what?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
	peered closely at Ludwig&rsquo;s countenance for the first time
	since their voyage into town. Some lightning flashed and Lemmy
	gasped, rolling back. &ldquo;W-what&rsquo;s wrong with your eyes?&rdquo;
	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His
	pupils were blacker than the sky and irregularly shaped, starry. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	did an odd uncanny smile, like a non-humanoid entity attempting it
	for the first time. He then rang the bell in wild motions. Zoo was
	about to pick himself up, wring a koopaling neck and snatch it out
	of his paws when he froze at the taste of blood in his mouth,
	streaming from his nose. He didn't make it off the summit, his
	strength eroding in an instant. Using that bell for a rare neat
	effect always gave him a pang of weakness, but the way Ludwig abused
	it-</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Iggy
	began to grimace, debilitated on his knees. The circus performer was
	beyond freaked out, because he never heard a proper ring under the
	thunder. Shortly the antique gave up the ghost and disintegrated in
	his brother's palms, some sort of particle or smoke releasing
	upwards into the air. Ludwig, his pupils blue once more,
	speechlessly staggered into Lemmy's arms, and they both collapsed
	into the high grass. The younger brother slid away from under him
	and craned his head upwards. The stormy clouds were shifting over to
	them. He could track it as the stars blanked out one by one and
	heavy gusty winds knocked him off his ball, and onto his knees,
	scabbing them up. The thunder seemed directly above them. He
	listened again. It was a voice all along!</font></p>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
	hurricane-like gale flicked the four bodies on the hill away like
	fleas. Those with spiked shells back into the woods, the one without
	the opposite direction. It was a very long drop down into the choppy
	seas of Pipe Land.</font></p>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The pink
	toad became exasperated by the looks received by his &lsquo;manager&rsquo;,
	watching him from the second-story balcony. Was attempting to
	garnish the lot, spending his dawn hours strenuously freeing the
	daisies from the choking snare of thorny weeds one by one, futile?
	He silently disagreed, slipping in longing over-the-shoulder glances
	as he drew away from the ten-by-ten planter in the middle of the
	concrete parking lot. Unlike most of his fellow displaced castle
	staff, he had had the equanimity to seek and latch on to and cherish
	any fragment of normality to be had. The gardener did not imagine
	there would be any other opportunities to do his job at the
	seven-story inn tucked in urban southwest Toad Town, known as Hotel
	Mario if the buzzing red neon lights were to be believed. Many
	didn&rsquo;t however!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
	persistent trio of chaperones, black spotted toads chatted behind
	the smudged glass entrance doors. The gardener passed them by
	uneventfully, needing service at the receptionist desk. He was so
	occupied he forgot to secure a room last night, a grave oversight
	when he was sweaty, caked with mud, and in dire need of a shower. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	bellhop goomba swiveled away from CRT tv with a loud screech,
	disinterest written all over him. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I take care of
	all you castle runts?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The toad
	signed &lsquo;Joseph&rsquo;. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What??
	Com'on, I&rsquo;m missing my strikers game and you expect me to sit
	here and read your mind? What do you want then??&rdquo; the goomba
	said belligerently, at least according to his lip movements.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Joe
	sighed, certain that at least translated. He pointed to the bold
	print placard &lsquo;CHECK IN HERE&rsquo; on the desk. Anything but
	to incur the same old platitudes he&rsquo;d heard his entire life
	when strangers sheepishly realized they were yelling at a deaf
	person. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	needs a lodge,&rdquo; someone with a northern tone spoke up,
	stepping over.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Shrinking
	somewhat, Joe looked up at the mushroom guard, a foot and a half
	taller and maybe one in a half times as wide. The guard&rsquo;s jaw
	jutted out a bit and he needed a haircut under his hat, but was
	decidedly handsome overall. His lanyard tag stated &lsquo;Benedict
	T., Poshley Royal Officer&rsquo;, and as hamstrung as he appeared,
	there was kindness evident in his dark brown eyes that tipped Joe
	that he meant well, even if he did not see what Ben just said.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The guard
	continued, &ldquo;I remember this one. He wasn&rsquo;t inside all
	night so there&rsquo;s no way he was given a key, eh.&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Begrudgingly
	the goomba shoved a room key under the plexiglass shield for Joe.
	The gardener signed &lsquo;thank you&rsquo; to the guard and went on
	his way deeper into the hotel.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-You
	sticking up for dummies?&rdquo; another guard ribbed Ben the moment
	he returned. He was the middle height of the three.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...Jon,
	I think he was disabled,&rdquo; Ben replied through his teeth. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh,
	sure. Much like-&rdquo; Jon nudged his elbow at the most stout guard
	whose back was turned as she watched a Jumpman themed gambling
	machine set to attract mode. He did not account for the fact that
	she saw that in the reflection.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	whipped around. &ldquo;You said you&rsquo;d locate that Mario guy by
	sunrise, haha. Who&rsquo;s stupid now?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Shut
	up Bridget! Nobody knows where that freak is!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Cause
	you&rsquo;re bossing us around instead of trying!&rdquo; Ben shouted
	back.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Is
	leaning from those thin balconies drilling in cameras not trying? Is
	wiring up surveillance by myself not trying?&rdquo; Jon slung open
	the door of the arcade room they&rsquo;d taken over as a base of
	sorts. &ldquo;You go in there and stare at the footage all day and
	then- Oh, sorry mate,&rdquo; he apologized when he almost slammed
	face first into someone leaving. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You&rsquo;re
	alright,&rdquo; the guest grunted. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The three
	guards straightened up their act in a flash, standing shoulder to
	shoulder, or approximately enough, as the portly middle aged fellow
	with a short recently grown beard, in a plain t-shirt and pants,
	strolled on by. To himself he smirked. That&rsquo;s really all it
	took to fool those amateurs, Mario thought!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	plumber rounded a corner, strategically avoided another, and
	proceeded down an adjacent path that he knew was unmonitored, based
	on what the guard&rsquo;s computers showed. That elation faded just
	as soon, for the truth was, he was losing the bigger battle at hand.
	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He&rsquo;d
	thrown in the towel just in time for Bowser to kidnap their beloved
	ruler in the most insultingly effortless way. Being bereaved in the
	middle of an epidemic lead to confusion, confusion to mourning, and
	mourning into resentment, all compounded by scandalous images
	circulating of Mario and Bowser &lsquo;frollicking&rsquo; around
	town yesterday. He&rsquo;d in fact had it thrown in his face a dozen
	times. With every viewing of that abhorrent image, Mario picked up
	an additional detail- the way his upper sleeve brushed up against
	the more sparsely layered scales of Bowser&rsquo;s, the way he
	minutely overtook the Koopa King on the sidewalk, as if he&rsquo;d
	be the one to shield him, how comfortable they seemed.. That last
	part made Mario&rsquo;s insides twirl and twist. No matter how
	propitiatory his explanations it was an anathema, punctuated by
	Bowser&rsquo;s treachery.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Consequently,
	the Mushroom King advanced beyond the mere invitation his daughter
	gave him before her kidnapping, and exerted himself into every
	aspect of Toad Town short of physical presence. Parakarry rushing to
	his front door at an unusual late hour with a declaration for his
	&lsquo;questioning&rsquo; plunged the most recognizable person in
	the kingdom into a near inescapable nightmare. Under the moonlight
	Mario packed and fled his house, altered his appearance, and took
	refuge in the most seedy area of town, intending to retrieve his
	brother the next morning and get out of dodge.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He&rsquo;d
	only forgotten in his haste that this was where Snifit Patrol
	dropped off Peach&rsquo;s toads!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After
	that mini heart attack, it was still salvageable- maybe. One of
	those castle toads was a true friend, with vital connections even.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">As well
	practiced, a prisoner bounced off his bed for the height he needed
	to cling to the iron bars high up. Light steadily rolled over the
	shanty roofs in the village. Some distance away, the more
	magnificent structures and spires of Poshley Heights were already
	soaking the sun.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Aye
	aye aye..&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The noki
	plopped back down on the bench and simmered, staring at the brick
	wall. Agent 0069&rsquo;s daring escape broke a rib, but he still
	hobbled back to base unidentified. Consequently, Andrew got to
	recover at the Toad Town Super Spy HQ and the noki in turn spent the
	night thousands of miles away in a high-security fortress.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A few
	more checks later and- there they were! A gentleman with a lady on
	his arm weaved around the stone garden leading to the jailhouse. The
	human male wore a tuxedo and his partner, a purple noki was adorned
	in a red ball gown. The only part of their spectacle the prisoner
	cared about however was the metal-covered platter in the madam's
	free hand, shining brightly. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Now he
	had something to smile about on the bench, kicking his legs that
	didn&rsquo;t quite reach the floor. Shortly, an officer was waddling
	down to his cell with the platter, uncovered to reveal a white cake
	with red and blue candies around the top. The ruse over, the couple
	that delivered it scurried away from the fortress while keeping a
	ten foot separation constantly, Agent W&rsquo;s arms crossed, Agent
	Maria pinching her nose in disgust..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	officer stuffed the cake carelessly into the one way reception cubby
	and ruined the succulent presentation. Agent 0064, known as
	Jelectro, eyed the strollin' stu indignantly yet Agent 0088,
	disguised as a Poshley Heights correctional officer, smirked in
	response. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Any
	news, mon ami?&rdquo; Jelectro whispered.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
	want the red plumber in here.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">In a rare
	moment Jelectro was dumbstruck. Eventually he placed the messy
	delicacy on his bench, a couple&rsquo;s cake, of vital importance
	for his escape. There was one issue. How the mechanic worked he did
	not understand, but they were impossible to eat alone.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	economy lounge, the more drab and smaller of the two in Hotel Mario:
	A ninji porter who thought he was some sort of performer, sat on the
	counter of the closed bar, reading off numbers for the after
	breakfast bingo games. Zeror and Chef Tim played along, if
	ironically, for the paltry prizes, aware that they&rsquo;d salvaged
	more than enough from the castle and had it secured upstairs. Ajar
	shutter doors lead to the pool deck where a purple toad, Les huddled
	up under the patio in a foreignly antisocial manner. Additional
	d&eacute;cor included couches, low tables, and potted plastic trees,
	that last of which became Mario&rsquo;s cover and he tiptoed through
	the lounge and into the darkened bar. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Careful
	to not tip glasses, he stooped lower than the counter and slipped
	into a back room with boxed ingredients and a broken ice machine
	hooked to the wall. Bucken-Berry had pried out the water line with
	his bare hands a while ago, creating an opening through the cheap
	sheetrock. He had to crawl to see out of it, but encouragingly dew
	coated grass and the hotel's rusty dumpsters were plain view.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	eagerly awaited his second ally, purportedly acquiring some
	inconspicuous transport out. Too paranoid to wander off, his knees
	became numb without the padding of his signature overalls&hellip;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Little
	feet dropped down inches from his nose.. &quot;Greetings sir!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	jolted, kicking over an empty beer can with a clang.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The red
	spotted toad bent to level and flashed him a picture perfect smile.
	&quot;Sorry, sir. Ready for adventure?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No.
	I'm not..&quot; Mario pant, fuming. &quot;I can hide for another
	hour I think maximum. Can you check on Luigi at the Toadley Clinic
	and come straight back? Here's his phone I've been holding, and
	this. It's his favorite in the morning, the only fresh fruit in this
	place funny enough.&quot; He handed off a ripe banana and Luigi's
	YoshiMobile.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">While his
	buddy took the items, he lingered. &quot;Mr. Lionel Kinopio is
	blogging about this entire matter from his limited perspective at MK
	East. What a travesty.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;..Seriously,
	Stan??.. Look, get my brother and then me. We'll talk.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Of
	course. Adieu,&quot; his helper replied, gently patting Mario's
	gloveless hand.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	rolled to his left, expecting to reach over and touch the console
	between his bed and Mario&rsquo;s. His arm instead thrust around
	into empty space, save for a metal pole that jangled. He slowly
	leaned up. Pulling back the partition curtain revealed Dr. Toadley&rsquo;s
	lab, devoid of patients and ransacked. Sheets from cots were piled
	in the corners. Hay, dirt, and hoof prints also marred the floors,
	the intern sweeping and cleaning around to the best of her ability
	in some unexpectedly casual wear, like slippers and a night bonnet.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With a
	burst of energy, he leaped off his cot and dashed out of the lab,
	not making it farther than the lobby when he collapsed, just
	catching a chair before he smacked the floor. Heart thumping in his
	ears, the first thing he made out was the character analog clock
	above the intern desk, a cartoony representation of his brother. He
	wasn&rsquo;t sure what time it was when he encountered Zoo in the
	park, but it appeared to be a </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Friday</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">
	evening now. Maybe that clock was a little slow, or he was lightning
	quick in defeating the bad guy. Now where was Mario and the gang? </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	regathered his strength and rolled over as Dr. Toadley waltzed into
	the lobby, barefoot and wearing a purple sleeping robe, gasping upon
	the sight of the green plumber. He rushed over. &ldquo;Has my
	Miracle Toadley Cure worked? Yes it has!&rdquo; he exclaimed, poking
	and prodding intrusively. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	gently pried his hands off. &ldquo;Thank you?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	doctor flushed, retrieving a memo pad and jotting a few things from
	right to left, Luigi found strange. &ldquo;All medical
	establishments rejected my special Miracle Toadley Cure. Did I think
	I would ever have an opportunity to revitalize someone with it? No I
	did not. If I may?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That&rsquo;s
	definitely unfair-&rdquo; Luigi had a thermometer shoved into his
	mouth. Where did it just come from?.. Anyway, he began to perceive a
	surge of energy from within, as if he guzzled too much coffee. His
	digits quaked. Was it that or something more? He often had extra
	senses for a variety of things. Sometimes it was skittishness for
	nothing, other times </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">something</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">..
	&ldquo;If I was split in half and this fixed me, what&rsquo;s the
	problem?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The toad
	doctor lifted from his notes, wariness sweeping across his features.
	&ldquo;Is Mirror Mode a temporary side effect? Yes, it is.&rdquo; He
	raised a hand. &ldquo;Right or left?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Right?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...Secondary
	test. What time is it?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Four
	o-two?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Eight-fifty.
	On an atypical Saturday morning!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Where&rsquo;s
	Mario?&rdquo; he begged.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	Mushroom King believes the red plumber had a ploy to get the
	princess kidnapped by King Bowser!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	spat out the thermometer. He shuddered from the sudden warmth on his
	shoulder from the toad doctor's palm. He rose to meet Dr. Toadley&rsquo;s
	gaze, his bare face, deceivingly more youthful than he sounded and
	behaved, painted with deep sympathy.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Am
	I still on your brother's side? Yes, I assure you. Our local
	hospital was taken over by the King as so I had some cowboys- long
	story, evacuate my patients before they were snatched away.&quot;
	Someone outside the clinic tapped on the glass front. Dr. Toadley
	chose to ignore it as his intern left the lab to deal with it. He
	continued, &quot;Is Southern Mushroom Kingdom a location where the
	King's laws do not hold precedent? Yes. My MKDCU affiliate Parabilly
	resides there.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi's
	eyes watered from the headache, endeavoring to think logically. It
	was the only way to help Mario. Bowser betrayed them. He might have
	been innocent at some point, but it didn't matter now. Why would the
	King, knowing his word was the law in the absence of their princess,
	adopt the drastic line of thinking that his brother planned this?
	Why did Peach even call on him yesterday when she never mentioned
	her father ever? So many pieces were missing from the puzzle.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Let
	me make a call.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A toad
	that the intern had just let in handed Luigi his YoshiMobile on cue.
	Astonished, the green plumber rose to his wobbly feet. He couldn't
	believe who he was seeing, at least without the brigade he was
	typically glued to.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	have a hunch your first call will be to your brother. Do not bother.
	Mr. Mario destroyed his phone to prevent tracking and he wants me to
	take you back to him before he expediently vacates.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
	wouldn&rsquo;t bother to do that hacking stuff to mine?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thanks,
	Captain Toad.&rdquo; Luigi set himself up for that, but it was kinda
	funny, enough to make him light headed as he laughed and laughed,
	continuing until he found himself on the hard tiled floor again,
	gasping for air next to their feet.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr.
	Toadley slapped his forehead. &ldquo;Was there an additional side
	effect of my Miracle Toadley Cure? Yes there was!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	shivered from a blast of cold. Half awake, he buttoned up a leather
	jacket that smelt pungent and manish, yet also faintly like his
	brother for some reason. He opened his eyes. He rode in the
	passenger spot of a wide bodied kart with three rows of seats. He
	could tell by the hood it was finished pale beige. Older modeled by
	the tarnished silver instruments on the dash, the plush burst orange
	interior package, and the wood grain panels. Remaining lazily
	reclined, he observed the city scrolling by. Toad Town seemed busy
	as normal, yet it became a spot the difference puzzle. Some block
	corners featured an armored Dry Bomber kart, repurposed for Mushroom
	forces. A gaggle of black spotted toads patrolled the sidewalks
	among the Mushroomite pedestrians, covered in body armor and
	carrying various spears and firearms. Yoshis using morph bubbles to
	transform into helicopters swooped around in aerial reconnaissance
	patterns. Promotionals tacked to some storefronts featured Mario,
	now defaced in various ways.. He was roused most by a large sign
	that passed by as they pulled onto a road with a steep incline.</font></p>

	</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Eyebrows
	furrowing, the plumber respelled that out in his mind. &quot;Mario
	is here?&quot; he asked raspily. He tilted to the driver, who was
	biting his lip, visibly jumbled by the simple question. He knew he'd
	have this problem with Stan. He uncannily resembled Toad in skin
	only. &quot;Captain!!! Where are we going??&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	Captain began to exude a different energy. &quot;Not much farther,
	Mr. Luigi. Have you seen Kinopio's recent ramblings?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No
	and I don't care. He was brought on for the pact. Seems reasonable,
	but Peach looked at follower numbers and went with that. Never mind
	he's the only toad to conspicuously dodge Mario and I. No, we didn't
	get a chance to sniff him out, so nothing is conclusive. We just
	know he's from Japan, Water Land.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
	have a problem with the Japanese?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;That's
	not what I!... Good to know his injuries weren't that bad if he's
	feeling up to his blogging ways.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;His
	legs are broken and there's a crack in his spine. He might have
	partial paralysis from now on,&quot; The Captain volunteered matter
	of factly, swinging their kart left and right to avoid the
	increasing amount of debris in the road as they entered official
	Castle Grounds.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The green
	plumber dropped that topic, horrified at the sight just across the
	glassy lake.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The first
	level of Peach Castle was totally disintegrated so that the
	crumbling brick on ground level currently, intruding on the basement
	and being flooded by the moat water was her second floor. The roof's
	pink tiles were spread more on the ground than attached to the
	building, and all the grass and vegetation was dead, the earthy
	surroundings a sea of murky dark brown. The land in general sloped
	upwards despite Star Hill being located a mile away.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;It's
	different,&quot; The Captain remarked in a lower, more real tone.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Huh?&quot;
	Luigi snapped back to the driver. Captain Toad's knuckles were
	revealingly white around the steering wheel.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Nothing!...&quot;
	They cruised down the sandy driveway that used to curve to the
	bridge. That only revealed more distressing sights.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Citizens,
	toads, some koopas, bob-omb buddies, etc spotted the property,
	mourning in sizable groups, often cuddling with a companion. For
	what had stood sacredly as the capitol building for hundreds of
	years, that was its unceremonious end. Bowser was not the blame for
	once. Some literal no-body, some 'Zoo' guy with a bell did it. It
	didn't seem right. Splitting him in half was one thing, King Boo for
	instance could mutilate a single target if he pleased, but warping
	the environment?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Captain,
	just turn around already! We gotta report this.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	Captain slammed on the brakes, making the right side of Luigi's face
	smack against the dashboard. The kart screeched and kicked up sand.
	A few around spared a glance before ignoring them again.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Ouch!
	What was that?!&quot; Luigi demanded as they reversed the way they'd
	come, driving backwards.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	complied! My goodness! Hahaha..&quot; The Captain honked as a few
	mushroomites dove out of the way. The kart careened down hill and
	the driver appeared to rely solely on the jiggling cracked in the
	center rear view mirror.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	revolved in his seat, shrieking at the innumerable near misses.
	Everything rattled and squeaked like they would break up. &quot;Captain!
	Watch out for that pianta to the right! I mean left! I mean- Why?!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	Captain's beady eyes glimmered. &quot;I know of the forces at play..
	Golly, in fact I've been the curator of such.&quot;<br/>
&quot;You've
	what?! Forget it. Move!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A young
	toad was trying to flag them down by standing directly in their path
	and flailing his arms. Luigi tugged the steering wheel, avoiding the
	dude by a hair. An ejected marble column from the castle launched
	the kart ten feet into the sky. The landing shook them like an
	earthquake, interior panels popping off, the sun shields flopping
	down, the radio sliding out, the rear view mirror detaching, and the
	glove compartment spilling its contents, mockingly of medical
	supplies into Luigi's lap.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
	slowly faced each other.. Before one could wring the neck of the
	other- guess which was which, a liquid sploshing noise alerted them
	from under the car. Whatever was running from their kart, the slimy
	dark stuff proceeded to roll into the nearby lake and pollute the
	environment. They got out and dropped belly first into the grit of
	the shore, groping around the many parts and pipes shaken loose in
	vain for the source of the growing leak. They stood again
	eventually.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;This
	is a rental. Let me study the manual.&quot; The Captain pulled out a
	magnifying glass.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	tapped his foot, wishing he was his more mechanically inclined
	brother. &hellip;Or not. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take forever. We need to
	tell Mario we can regroup safely down south.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ah,
	a treasure hotspot.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Focus
	on that book!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">This
	will ease you.&rdquo; He tossed him a banana.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	munched on it angrily- at first. &ldquo;...Oh hey, you&rsquo;re
	right.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Just out
	of their view, the teenager that was almost tenderized kept inching
	closer. If he wasn't Darklandian, he'd be sure the stars were
	smiting him. No matter what he did since hopping on that baddie
	shipping truck into town, it spiraled into something horrific. This
	was it, he thought stoically. He&rsquo;d fess up.</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;M
	SORRY!!!&rdquo; he cried hysterically, barging into Luigi and
	Captain Toad. The haggard teen threw himself down before their
	boots. &ldquo;It was all me. Oh my God, I&rsquo;m sorry again! I was
	new here, yesterday, and then- the castle- went- it- did a thing
	and- the sky and-!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	turned to the Captain. &quot;He's lost it, and we can't even drive
	him to get some help!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thomas
	perked up. &ldquo;Just patch the synthol tank. The rock pierced it.
	Here. Use something like this,&rdquo; he reached for some of the
	first aid patches and spray adhesive that had tumbled out the car.
	He crawled under the vehicle for only a few seconds and returned to
	the plumber&rsquo;s side. The oil or gas or whatever it was dried up
	in seconds. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi pat
	him on the back appreciatively, hiding how unsettled he was when the
	teen felt so scrawny. &quot;You're pretty good-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Thomas.&quot;
	To his dismay, the teen welled up. &quot;Mr. Zoo was looking for me
	and so&hellip;I-I caused this!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
	didn't,&quot; The Captain spoke up first, surprising Luigi. &quot;I
	am sure you contributed however..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Nevermind.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Babe
	don't! See? It's nothing. Okay? Just go back to our room.&quot;</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Why
	you gotta do this? Stop scrambling around looking for..&quot;</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
	listening to me??&quot;</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;WAIT!
	It's closed sweetheart, what do you want in there?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Behind
	the lounge's bar, Bucken-Berry pressed his hand over her's once she
	placed it on the storage room handle.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
	furiously spun into him. &quot;Back off Blue.&quot; She ducked under
	his arm and slipped into the totally icky and musty dark room, rife
	with a stale beer smell, and cheaply stored food, with an unsightly
	hole in the wall. The crumbly plaster matched the stuff her
	boyfriend struggled to brush off his clothes and shower from his
	skin.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Why
	are you destroying the property? It doesn't need you to do that,&quot;
	she teased at first. In the corner of her eye however, behind
	Bucken-Berry's sneakers as he shuffled in was a red duffle bag
	hidden behind kegs.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Is
	that Mario's?&quot; She blushed. &quot;Oh my gosh, he's been here
	and you knew it?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The blue
	toad kept his head down. &quot;Is this situation fair to him?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Of
	course not! But we have an allegiance to all Toadstools and.. I'm
	sure they'll handle... So you've met with him?&quot; Her accusatory
	glare impaled him.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Toadette,
	it ain't a fanboy thing. It's screwed up.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;The
	decree-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-You
	a freaking robot or something?&quot; he snapped. &quot;Blind
	following's why we're stuck in this hotel!! Where I can't even visit
	Ala-Gold during his last hours on Earth!!!&quot;<br/>
Her scowl
	faded away. &quot;I understand..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;And
	now you're about to backpedal..&quot; he growled. &quot;It's how
	these conversations always go. Toadette, you're supposed to be
	smart. We're listening to Peach's dad who sent his agents on us
	instead of getting his daughter back. What, if you capitulate- I
	used it right this time- enough it'll work out?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Blue,
	oh my gosh,&quot; she exclaimed, sitting stuffily on a supply box.
	&quot;All of this is unideal to me too. Why are you so pissed at
	me?!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Why
	are you stringing me along?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	stared incredulously, flushing. &quot;I'm not!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	thawed, facing away. &quot;Princess school. Ring a bell? Thought so.
	Parakarry must have had a late night out. He knocked on my window
	with the invite. It was me that dropped it on your night stand, not
	Toadsworth.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
	could have sworn a launch star shot her into space, directly into a
	black hole.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~The
	Princess School in Jewelry Land was an elective for budding
	princesses and or their stewardesses of extra exemplary rapport. One
	was instructed all the ends and outs of aristocracy and stewardesses
	often returned to their kingdom with such elevated status, they were
	eligible to be betrothed by a baron, perhaps even an earl, leaving
	behind those peasant like, ordinary, or estranged. -Like
	Bucken-Berry 'Yvan' Kingpin Toad.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;That
	class was for experience!&quot; She broke down, crying into her
	palms. &quot;And how was I going to refuse? That's all I ever wanted
	to do!!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yeah,
	well being Mario's sidekick was all I ever wanted to do, so WHY ARE
	YOU FREAKING JUDGING YOU HYPOCRITICAL BRAT! One more lofty than the
	other or what?? That's why you gave up yoshi cookies so you wouldn't
	appear so 'vapid'? Why you run yourself ragged and follow orders you
	know are wrong? Forget it. You'd never get that gold star from the
	King. Not the right pedigree. Besides, he's nothing to us. Our
	princess took over. She still rules.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Okay
	okay!&quot; she begged. He'd lowered his voice by then, but it
	didn't matter. The boxed Nintendo Cereal System under her was
	popping and crackling, engulfed with her tears. Did he have to bat
	down, one by one all the </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">statutes</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">
	she'd branded into her heart like that? Worse yet, did he have to be
	so right? &quot;... I just thought I was doing the right thing..&quot;
	she mewled.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Me
	too last night, when I was about to quit. Come here.&quot; Softening
	even more, he wrapped his arms around her. &quot;Don't help me out
	here for me. I know I'm a jerk sometimes. Help because Mario has to
	get away from these goons first of all, second it's the only way
	we'll get Peach back.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;How?&quot;
	She pulled back, concerned. &quot;We're minuscule against them.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Doesn't
	matter,&quot; he replied, more stalwartly than she'd ever heard.
	&quot;Anywhere there's a need, Good arises.&quot;</font></p>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Benedict
	concluded his walk-around at the reception office where there was no
	one but the clerk watching a super sluggers game behind the glass.
	His squad promised to wait and leave for break together.. He let
	that frustration go as a delicious scent struck his nostrils. A
	monty-mole porter crossed by, munching on a Muku cookie while
	pushing that cleaning cart. Ben's stomach rumbled, and like a cheep
	cheep on a line, he followed deeper into Hotel Mario. Getting lost
	in the windy layout, he asked the nearest staff doing room service
	where the heck the food was coming from.</font></p>
	<p>&hellip; 
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Great
	idea,&quot; the man said. He sat on a couch with a low table in
	between him and the two others on a parallel couch. A ceramic plate
	of pastries were stacked high, though he retained no appetite.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Thank
	you, er, Curtis..&quot; It had blown Toadette's mind that she'd been
	face to face with that human twice incidentally, none the wiser. &quot;It
	was time I used that 'Greedy Eats' app promo.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	never doubted that you'd use food to distract,&quot; Bucken-Berry
	said, toying with her.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Because
	it works exceptionally!&quot; Toadette countered. &quot;This lounge
	has been dead since piling the food up in the other one, pfft!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Curtis
	combed his fingers through his oily brown hair. &quot;Not to bring
	ants to the picnic, but 'shhh'. If my help takes too long, heck, the
	bar back there might actually open for business by then. Goodbye
	short cut-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Words
	died on his tongue as Ben strolled in, glazed over and hungered
	before distinguishing himself in their presence. He became aware
	that he was directed to the wrong location. Still, there was at
	least some substance here. &quot;Greetings. Do you mind?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	gingerly sat next to that Curtis guy, depressing the couch with his
	huge figure as he judiciously reached for a Coco Candy. Ben choked
	on it a little as he swallowed, everyone was looking at him like he
	was some hideous freak, or a Yux from the moon about to eat them.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Officer,
	a mouser is loose in my room and I can't get anyone to shoo it out.
	You'll help me won't you?&quot; Curtis tapped the guard's square
	shoulders.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I'm
	no pest control, sir.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I'm
	not picky. Let's go,&quot; he replied brusquely.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">This
	seemed to work and they rose together to the elevator, crossing the
	bar counter and the slightly ajar back room door.. He selected floor
	four and waited alongside the sentry while some old school elevator
	music buzzed from a dusty speaker. He wasn't sure if he should slump
	or stand more erect to obfuscate his identity better. Benedict was
	no half-pint, and then there was the matter of that lethal super
	scope he carried&hellip;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Back in
	the lounge the blue and pink toad were on their feet. &quot;Crud!&quot;
	Bucken-Berry broke into a sprint with Toadette on his heels. They
	retreated to their sorta junky and messy suite and jumped on the
	most clear of the twin beds. &quot;That won't hold up.&quot; He
	called someone.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Not
	even with the power of his beard?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He faced
	her, phone pressed to his ear. &quot;No. Not even that.&quot; He
	groaned, not getting anyone. He tapped an extremely inflammatory
	message to The Captain then.<br/>
She peeked over his phone,
	blushing. &quot;You'd do WHAT to him in a fight??&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	smirked. &quot;You know it, babe.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Good.
	He chose treasure over me multiple times on an adventure once. I
	have never liked him since.&quot; She pressed her lips into his,
	making them fall back.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Curtis
	led the guard as nonchalantly as he could toward room 404. Zeror,
	Peach's worldly banker and treasure curator, wasn't superstitious of
	the number four and in fact relished being roomed away from the
	rest. Diabetic, he would have to be downstairs somewhere for lunch.
	All the human had to do was pretend this was his suit and-</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Here,

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yes.
	-Wait don't!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The guard
	kicked the door in with a thunderously loud bang. Curtis winched as
	Ben erratically swept around the twin bedroom with his super scope
	drawn. Salvaged items of Peach Castle stacked along all four walls
	in crates and boxes.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ben
	lowered the gun, unenthused. &quot;Quite a haystack to find a little
	mouser, eh?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
	have to start somewhere.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ben froze
	before one particular stack of goods. &quot;Yeah, like this one. Why
	does this say 'Property of Peach Castle'?&quot; he asked with
	suspicion.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Beads of
	sweat formed on Curtis' hatless head. &quot;From a private auction
	I'm sure,&quot; he guessed, unable to see what Ben was staring at a
	foot or so above his eye level.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;The
	princess would vend those precious jewels? I am not stupid, sir. She
	is not strapped for cash!&quot; Ben abruptly pushed Curtis into the
	crate stack, pinning him tightly in place with his forearm. Some
	crates toppled to the floor, hoards of beautiful gems and old bronze
	artifacts spilling out. &quot;Everyone in the eight continental
	kingdoms knows your name and to think, you've hurt our princess so
	wantonly! You're the wanted thief...&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Fine,
	I'm Mario.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Waluigi!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;...What?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Then the
	radio strapped to the guard's hip beeped and went off.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Would
	you believe people down here don't know how to park?&quot; That
	lioness with them cackled. &quot;When they pulled up near the back
	dumpster, I made them use the parking lot like civilized people.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ben
	scrambled to click the call button, having to find it under his
	shirt. Before he could reply the other guard responded.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Why
	is this news, mate?&quot; Jon replied vexingly.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Well,
	you'd think Luigi would know better than that!&quot; Bridget said.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Would
	he?&quot; Ben asked Mario.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Maybe.
	Would you know better than to take your eyes and hands off the
	perpetrator?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	socked him in the jaw, stunning the toad. He grabbed Ben by the
	lanyard and slung him backwards into the crate stack collapsing the
	rest of the hoard. With the exit barricaded, Mario pressed against
	the sealed window. Beyond the balcony he spotted The Captain's kart,
	one of several run down ones parked in the front of Hotel Mario.
	What were they doing? They were identified! Mario felt around antsy
	for a latch, stuck from old paint layered on. He needed a blunt
	object. As Ben was stirring under the pile of antiques, Mario hauled
	some giant paper wrapped picture frames over his head, trapping him.
	He picked up Ben's discarded super scope and rammed the stock of it
	against the glass. With mounting frustration his fingers pressed
	something they shouldn't have and he accidentally shot a yellow
	energy beam behind him at the heavy down bed comforter. Smoke
	billowed as alarms blared, both obscuring the sound and vision of
	the one charging at him.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wham!
	They burst through the window, sliding on the balcony outside. Mario
	squeezed his eyes shut as he was pummeled by the once docile giant,
	and inch from the edge. The second Ben's energy was expelled, Mario
	used that opportunity to whip him with the barrel of the super
	scope. Ben flew backwards with a groan. Bruised and bloodied, Mario
	staggered to his feet, aiming the weapon in between the toad's brown
	eyes. Ben jut his hands into the air, speechless.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	wouldn't blast his head off, but the guard didn't believe that. What
	lies had the King spread? It made him appalled he'd made the
	threatening display, chucking the super scope away to leap off the
	balcony and onto a camera drilled into some gutter drain pipes.
	Below Hotel Mario had more guests than imagined evacuating.
	Steadily, the pipe began to flex under the plumber's weight. The
	drop was just higher than he knew he could take without injury. Then
	out of the sea of folks, his angel was revealed. He dropped four
	stories down into the arms of Bucken-Berry, bridal style.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Thanks
	buddy.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Heh.
	Whatever.&quot; The toad carried him a semi brisk pace.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
	can put me down.&quot; Mario went, wryly. &quot;Might be quicker.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">One
	scattered in the lot never smelt smoke or saw any flames. Jon
	twisted in time to see a human and toad heading for a Kart parked in
	the rear of the lot. Something seemed odd about it, the way they
	were making a mad dash when others impatiently waited for the fire
	department to show and allow them in. Then some prankster toad girl
	with pigtails pulled a pillowcase over him, making him trip over a
	parking block and curse.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">By then
	Mario and Bucken-Berry reached the kart, swinging in. &quot;Go!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
	wish is my command.&quot; The Captain turned the key a couple of
	times. &quot;Or a suggestion rather.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">As
	sitting ducks, here came the 'zapper' as Bridget popped up in the
	passenger window, ice cream cone in hand.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She was a
	cute little thing if ruddy, sandy hair hanging limp under the black
	spotted toad cap, smiling and displaying a childish tooth gap. &quot;Oh
	wow, ha ha, I did something right! I found Luigi AND Mario, hahaha.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	compulsively laughed with her, more and more, his seat giving way
	and kicking back. She froze, confused but flattered as he cracked
	apart.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Alright,
	I was gonna send a bunch of copters over to vaporize you, but I'll
	give you a five second head start. Okay go.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;How
	about a five second push? With me?&quot; So authoritatively Mario
	spoke then, the guard lady obeyed. They rolled the kart backwards,
	giving it a push start. &quot;Thanks.&quot; Mario winked and hopped
	on the hood, leaving her and Hotel Mario behind as they rolled onto
	Starman Lane in reverse. Mario dropped back in from the sun roof.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
	can turn around in that open driveway other there-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No
	need.&quot; Captain Toad mashed the gas, catapulting them down the
	street and through many red lights. Cars honking was a wall of noise
	from every direction. Some mushroom tanks spotted and chased them
	preparing to fire. Chill as a freezie, The Captain made a sharp turn
	onto an exit away from the city. The ramp dumped them over bumpier
	paths with barbed wire fencing lining the street banks.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	know that Mario Kart race was two days ago, but anyone held on to an
	item?&quot; Mario asked.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The fifth
	passenger, tucked away in the third row the entire time, hurled
	Luigi's garbage banana peel out from the sunroof, forcing the tanks
	to veer off road and plow over cacti.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Who
	did that?&quot; Bucken-Berry's blood ran cold finding Thomas, the
	new guy in the thrid row.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">As for
	the rest of the occupants, including Luigi deliriously recovering
	from the laughing fit, they wondered why the hunt was abruptly cut
	off, the tanks shrinking with distance.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A quarter
	mile back, some guards scrambled out their armored vehicles and beat
	their fists into the red soil. Mt. Rugged and mesas, light and hazy
	were in the background, a hint of the inhospitable territory beyond,
	yet the barrier keeping them at bay was a single painted white line
	in the road, the Toad Town to Southern Mushroom Kingdom border.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	felt his soul drift about in the aether, awaiting it&rsquo;s final
	destination. His outer layers shed piece by piece, the side of him
	that desired more badges than a trophy case could hold, the part
	that held his own musical pieces in the same regard as Kchaikovsky,
	the part that cackled like a maniac during lab experiments- until he
	was lucent, uncolored, down to the scrupulous bits. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He used
	to worry about his future, what might be left of his role as his
	siblings, one in particular grew older. If he could really make a
	difference for his koopa brethren in that short span. An army could
	pillage a kingdom in days, yet its progress may be undone just as
	quickly by toads and their worker bee ways. His purpose therefore
	was not destruction for destruction&rsquo;s sake, chaotic sadistic
	endeavors, though that may have been the rite of his ancestors, but
	rather to dismantle their institutions and free its members from an
	enslavement they may not be cognizant of. Like a beautiful
	orchestra, only then would all the diverse &lsquo;sections&rsquo;
	blend with true harmony.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Too bad
	he never had a chance! This was the woeful &lsquo;him&rsquo;
	ultimately presented for judgment, approaching the gate that
	enclosed a suspended sapphire colored perfectly square platform in
	space. There were white fields, sparkling rivers, and of course a
	stupendous golden castle towering high above.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	Koopaling&rsquo;s eyes, or whatever physical embodiment was left of
	them narrowed, focusing on a holographic scroll posted to the gate
	with a crooked nail.</font></p>
	<p><em>&lsquo;</em><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Attention,
	Star Temple is closed f'rev'r and f'rev'r, ya undes'rving

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The beige
	paint on the hood of the car bubbled. The wood paneling delaminated
	and flaked off. The exposed metal parts developed a glow like a
	stove top. That was after a mere fifteen minutes driving on the
	fringe of Dry Dry Desert. A tweester shorty after bombarded them and
	plopped the kart smack in the middle of the parched land. That was
	when trepidation crept into the caravan. A sandstorm forced the
	windows up in the kart, making temperatures rise astronomically. The
	three toads present, all hardy in their own way, were able to
	tolerate it, but for the humans it all went white.<br/>
&hellip;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario and
	Luigi glanced at each other periodically in the tided up den,
	containing only what it was supposed to, the large screen
	entertainment system, a portrait or two on the walls, and comfy
	recliner chairs stationed side by side. There was no conflict, aside
	from over the remote. The television was fixed to Luigi's favored
	Bob-omb Ross program. The afroed artist delicately crafted a scene
	of a tropical paradise, fitting as it was a perfect day in the
	roofless cutout of their living room floating in the foggy
	dreamscape.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Consequently,
	it was with guilt that discontentment swept across the younger
	brother's features. &quot;I can't sit here and pretend anymore. Why
	can't I get Yoshi? This isn't like him.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;It's
	still better he's removed from this situation.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	understand why you say that, but..&quot; He stared downwards at the
	starman pattern blanket laying across his lap, considering jabbing
	the off button on the remote. &quot;Know what? I'll trust you
	again.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His
	brother's fingers curled on the armrest. On tv, the tranquil
	masterpiece took a swerve. On the edges of the canvas darker skies
	encroached. &quot;Good. -I mean, good I can still invoke that-
	'trust me' reverence,&quot; he said pithily.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	straightened his posture, kicking the leg rest down. &quot;...So is
	this a bad time to mention that Kinopio-Kun is blogging against you?
	That you're a wanted suspect? That all but five Mushroom Flu
	patients are still at MK East? That-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	squeezed his hand lightly. &quot;I knew already.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;..Good!
	Or.. Sorry bro. What good is this fantasy? I'm supposed to be alert,
	aloof-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;This
	is your first day in my shoes alright-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	slapped him with his 'L' emblem pillow. &quot;Not overly so. Besides
	I think I know work and life balance more than you.. Tell me
	something you wouldn't in the real world then.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;When
	I had to use Cappy on Bowser, there wasn't anything I learned that
	he hadn't told me at some point. With Peach, she's always holding
	back.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Well,
	you two were never 'official'.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;That's
	the key? No. One didn't want to be caged by the past and another
	isn't willing to leave that cage yet. Simple.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	retrieved a thick dusty book wedged in the magazine rack, why he
	didn't know when it was some V8 engine manual. That might had been
	true, but unlike Mario content to note the quirks of the alien
	environment, he liked to properly document it, research, journal,
	sometimes even write a story out of it.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Alright,
	so he was susceptible to some fantasy. Now he was imagining some
	music for instance, and neither of their preferred genres.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The banjo
	and 'geetar' dueled with an intricate folksy melody. High powered
	pedal steel amplifiers with fifteen inch speakers broadcast from the
	wooden covered porch of the Southern Mushroom Kingdom Hospital.
	There were no cell phones, radios, or cars speeding in the shanty
	town, just a distant rumble from the tweesters of the desert fenced
	off 'round back. Ranchers and herders, most of the koopa or shy guy
	variety, crossed by, their work boots and the prancing feet of
	ostros marking fresh tracks as they did business.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After a
	slew of off-tuned counter-melodies from the country guitar, the tune
	came to a close with a pop.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Dang
	it, Junior. Whole thang ruined!&quot; The straw hat wearing ptooie
	plant smacked the koopa in the rocking chair beside him.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jr.
	Troopa readjusted his black ten gallon hat. &quot;Thought I nailed
	that verse, pard!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Prot&eacute;g&eacute;
	of the reclusive CEO 'Mr. X' as of a few months ago, Troopa remained
	unconvinced if antics like this were some kind of hillbilly hazing
	or simply how things worked down in this backwards offshoot of the
	Mushroom Kingdom. Tomorrow it could be moo moo wrangling, or
	harvesting wiggler silk, or being the target for cork gun
	quickdraws. -None of which had to do with his actual occupation as a
	triage nurse. Then again, dysfunction was exciting compared to the
	lonely Toad Town apartment the twenty year old had to look forward
	to every night at twelve..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Troopa
	placed the acoustic guitar into his hard case and stood, stretching
	his legs. &quot;Head'n to the can, partner.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Again?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Umm.
	Yep!&quot; Jr. Troopa scoot away, aware Victor P. had some venus
	fire trap genes.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	koopa's awkward wings that never quite developed fully carried him
	pitifully low over unpaved streets, aiming for his office down the
	block. If there was one thing he enjoyed it was how he could wear a
	hat all the time and hide his untamable messy brown hair. If there
	was a thing he hated, it was how messages were sent. Here came one
	now, dirt flying high in their wake.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Sir,
	hold a sec!&quot; A nurse, a normal one not a countrified version,
	skidded his ostro a stop at Troopa's side, sending the second
	occupant on the back, a red toad in a white doctor's coat sliding
	off the leather saddle and face first into the dirt.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Troopa
	automatically pulled him up. They locked eye to eye in an intensity
	Laki the nurse picked up on. He nodded and left the scene quickly.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Doc?
	You're back?&quot; Troopa spoke at last, dropping the cowpoke act.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
	brushed the dirt off his jacket, all dignified like. &quot;Dr.
	Toadley's formal inquiry found its way into my shredder, but I got
	word of your Mushroom Flu predicament regardless,&quot; he
	explained. &quot;I had no plans, but you know how I am flexible,
	don't you?-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Mhm.&quot;
	Troopa flushed harder. Meddlesome as usual, still lanky, pompous..
	Also just as tall and successful as ever, with blonde hair longer
	than last time he'd seen him, tucked under the red cap. By the way
	he couldn't stand him...</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-A
	crew will be joining me later. Now, will you explain why your
	associate spotted me, swung me on that animal, and gushed about your
	tremendously good rapport during the entire trip?&quot; Dr. Toad
	folded his arms, smirking. &quot;You are the secretary of this
	facility, I've already been told. Wonderful to see my ex-partner
	level up. Finally.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jr.
	Troopa seized the toad by his upper shoulder. &quot;In there. Now!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	dragged him into the closest building out of the rays of the sun and
	prying passerby, the empty saloon. A ruff puff waitress noticed them
	and shuffled away to grab an apron. They slid into the bench close
	to the western swing door. Why'd it have to be Ruff Parlor, one of
	the few eateries around they'd been to before together? Dr. Toad was
	a food scientist starting out, so there was some educational
	motivation besides the two of them hanging out, soon to realize it
	wasn't 'bout to work.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	don't care if you're helping us out with the five we got.&quot;
	Troopa crossed his arms. &quot;Just don't be funny about it!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
	drummed his skinny fingers against the table, simultaneously viewing
	chart or pdf on his phone. &quot;All I need is two two-acre sized
	area for parking and your vacant office space.&quot;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">My</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">
	office space?!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Correct.
	Yours,&rdquo; Dr. Toad emphasized, some modulation- was that
	playfulness- sneaking into his low dryish voice. &ldquo;That is your
	fait accompli, Jackson.&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jackson&rsquo;
	Troopa Jr. narrowed his eyes. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the real reason
	you&rsquo;re here, Drew?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Because
	the only other Mushroom Flu patents are in Toad Town, which is too
	outdated for my advanced procedures and remedies. That was why I had
	to move out.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	waitress sat a mug of creme soda down. Troopa Jr. took a long overly
	loud sip, wiping away the fizz mustache after. &ldquo;Sure that was
	the only reason??&rdquo; he snapped. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Obliviously,
	Dr. &lsquo;Drew&rsquo; Toad lifted one eyebrow.. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hon,
	your radio with cha?&rdquo; asked the waitress lingering with the
	two men. &ldquo;Vick&rsquo;s blowing the staff up!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Troopa
	shot her a look. &ldquo;What miss, for an encore?!?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Naw,
	spotters saw this smoked-out kart roll&rsquo;n along. Mr. Mario, Mr.
	Luigi, and three cute lil toads are in it!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p>&lsquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">So
	yeah you can uh, leave your name and number and I&rsquo;ll, uh, call
	back when I can! Seeya!&rsquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo&rsquo;s
	empty stomach rumbled as the only number they had saved on their
	phone, aside from their mother, routed to voicemail repeatedly.
	Another worrisome thing to top the pile of this strange day so far.
	They&rsquo;d woken up super late with a migraine and no recollection
	of what occurred since stumbling into that Club Gamecube place they
	shouldn't have yesterday. Their compulsive habit of browsing the
	Toad Town message boards was a bust as well, making them reflect on
	&lsquo;back in the day&rsquo;- actually just a year ago or so when
	all they had courage to do was passively watch and swoon at Mario
	and company, particularly the younger Mario brother, during games
	and public events and romps with Bowser. They couldn&rsquo;t go back
	to that!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo
	scraped up some courage and ventured out into Toad Town. They made
	it as far as Tayce T.&rsquo;s shop on the East side where local kids
	from the Dojo were waiting at the corner&rsquo;s bus stop. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
	gonna be picked!&rsquo; And another would go, &lsquo;No me! I&rsquo;m
	third-degree level!&rsquo; and the third, &lsquo;Actually both of
	you have low probability. *snorts* They prefer toads. Said so in the
	fine print of the-&rsquo;. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Some
	shadows crept over Boo from behind. They spun around, face to face
	with a group of rugged, scary, heavily armed.. toads? Boo shot back
	home, beginning to understand just how much of the confidence on
	display yesterday, or what they remembered of it, was a contact
	high- Boo stopped there, too square for such a simile. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Excuse
	me buddy!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	parakoopa brushed beyond Boo and sprint hopped up the cabin steps of
	the neighbor, slipping a one page news bulletin partially into the
	door and scuttling off before Boo could correct them. Boo was a
	diddly. The pink boo in that conspicuous picture-estique oak wood
	cabin was a &lsquo;boo buddy&rsquo; however, or at least a rejected
	one according to the tale he told Boo once, recounted in his bouncy
	cadence and punctuated by a creepy giggle. Those hibbie-jibbies sped
	Boo along subconsciously because they were already back in town,
	just in time to catch Parakarry crossing the bridge and delivering
	mail to an office building on the street. Modern, it was not of
	Mushroomy architecture but sleeker, more boxy and efficient with a
	single cubby on the ground floor, tucked away in a recess to keep it
	out of the sun.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo
	approached as Parakarry steadily filled it up with pink flyers. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mail
	call!&rdquo; he sang, handing Boo a thin advert bundle. &ldquo;No
	long face. Junk mail means they know you&rsquo;re still alive, so
	somebody's always thinking about cha, if you want to see it like
	that.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">..Right.
	I think. Why&rsquo;d you skip my house the first time?&rdquo; Boo
	thought to ask.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	paratroopa&rsquo;s smile stretched, hovering his key outside the
	cubby lock. &ldquo;Hm?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	thought I saw you drop something off for Trevor Buddy?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Parakarry
	secured the box with a metallic clang. &ldquo;Nope nope nope.. Now
	I&rsquo;m a little busy, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Something
	overtook Boo. They reached for the parakoopa as he shimmied by,
	pressing him shell first against the metal box. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">DID
	YOU JUST LIE TO MY FACE?!? I saw you with my own freaking eyes!!&rdquo;
	Booigi the Second growled. Their pressure against his scale plates
	chilled him to the touch. &ldquo;I. Saw. You. WHAT WERE YOU
	DOING?!?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">EElldssttar,
	hhholld up! Heeree!&rdquo; Parakarry&rsquo;s teeth clacked in his

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Booigi&rsquo;s

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Parakarry

	Okay here is a better way to put it. In a monarchy, does the

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A heavily
	loaded yellow school bus rocked and squeaked on its way from
	'Bowser' Badlands, a remote portion of Dark Land abandoned by the
	Koopa Troop since their last blunder of a complete Mushroom World
	takeover. The National Koopa Scouts of Dark Land claimed it cheaply,
	prime territory for little Darklandians to be taught the ways of
	survival away from modern amenities. Climate change brought rain
	there a lot, swamping it up for the boys and girls, though the
	severe storm that ripped through last night was a little out of the
	ordinary, making the rural stretch of road from there to Neo Bowser
	City extra muddy and cluttered with debris.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	classic campfire song 'Ain't No Fly Guys on Us' blared in the ears
	of one particularly broody scout as he kicked his feet and mumbled
	along. The prince dropped his gaze to his sash covered with weighty
	badges, wondering what was the point. His father signed a waiver so
	that he could be as any other scout, free to run and scream and get
	dirty and gross. The problem was that camp only lasted overnight
	when school was in. After those precious few hours, some of which
	were 'wasted' during the sleepover aspect as staying up late was not
	permitted, he was heading back home, back to being babied all day,
	back to being the source of gossip and hushed talk behind his back
	and junk..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Their
	Scoutmaster stationed behind the driver twisted around.. &quot;Wow!
	That was our best rendition yet!&quot; Also the twentieth in a row,
	the boomerang bro muttered, borrowing the GPS from the red eyed
	buzzy beetle driver. To his concern there was heavy damage even as
	they crawled closer to urbanization. In some spots there were only
	foundations left! &quot;Kids stay in your seats, we're almost to our
	first stops. Remember what we learned about weather?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;The
	rain clouds get angry and then dance around in a circle!&quot; a
	spiny scout way in the back answered.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Thaaaat's
	right! It's called a tornado. Oh and here's..&quot; The scoutmaster
	blinked at it again. &quot;..Here's Scout Junior's stop coming up.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	Junior strapped his oversized backpack on and loitered out, staring
	at his toes the entire time. Suddenly his left foot was dangling
	over the edge of a deep crevasse in the ground. The tyke staggered
	backward before he plunged into Bowser Castle's empty moat. Across
	from where the draw bridge would connect was a huge pile of stone
	and brick rubble. Junior gaped speechlessly until something swept
	him off his feet.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Careful
	over there son! Are you alright? Good!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A battle
	tank was flipped upside down and wedged over the moat, creating a
	bridge for the father and son to cross. Amidst the pile were exposed
	stairs going down. The thick iron cages of the dungeon were swung
	wide open and standing in the walkways in between them were Morton,
	Larry, Roy, Wendy, also some guardians, Kamek and Kammy, and some
	castle staff, lastly 'momma' Peach. Sheets and flipped mattresses
	were leaning against the walls in a tent formation.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser's
	pointer claw darted around, doing a count while Junior remained in
	his other arm, his questions ignored. &quot;Okay. Er, right. We're
	rolling out. Once we find everybody we're sending Peach back!&quot;
	Their murmurs of concertation made him growl. &quot;What's the
	problem? We're supposed to sit here and wait for them to find US? We
	gotta regroup, find a new castle, other stuff, you know the drill!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Wait
	a minute daddy!&quot; Wendy skipped over. &quot;If we split up, can
	I lead a group and communicate with codes and stuffs?-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Morton
	joined his big sister. &quot;So that we may be informed, harmonious,
	on the same page.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	soured more. Bereaved of his commander Ludwig, this was a hot mess.
	Larry and Roy shared an exasperated look over their sibling's showy
	behavior, particularly Wendy. Just an hour ago she was sobbing
	hysterically over her 'precious' things trashed and what her school
	friends might say.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;We're
	sticking together! No!&quot; Bowser declared. &quot;Now get out!!!&quot;
	He scanned the dungeon one last time for stragglers, jolting a
	little at how suddenly the princess was upon him inches away. She
	was baggy-eyed, otherwise normal considering how far she fell. Must
	be that pretty armor.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
	have my condolences for this natural disaster and I hope you locate
	everyone. Sincerely. Now if I am free, why don't I remain here with
	Toadsworth for rescue?&quot; she prodded gently.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I'd
	rather you stick with me too, Hotness.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Her
	polite fa&ccedil;ade evaporated. &quot;You cannot hold us captive
	until you locate each and every soldier! How long will that take?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;..As
	long as it needs!&quot; He slung her over his shoulder before. &quot;We
	all get to suffer together! If your old man needed some attention, I
	might change my mind, but he didn't make it. Sorry!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-He
	did , you brute!&quot; she fussed up the stairs.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Whatever
	you wanna believe.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	King's bedroom was the first to sway, forces dumping him off his
	bed. He smashed an alarm to send everyone to the lowest elevation
	possible, assuming it was a volcanic eruption. With all the
	occupants of the castle at that time stumbling paces behind him,
	Bowser lit the oil lamps with his fire breath. One revealed the
	prisoner that had been there already. There was no helping him. That
	person was Toadsworth, and he had expired.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Or not
	anymore judging by chest moments of the body on the mattress. What
	the?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Now he
	had to do it. When she requested Larry accompany her, he worried a
	lot less. He was as sneaky as her, making them evenly matched. She
	didn't know what she was up against.</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	reunited with his tawdry Troop in the front lawn, diminished by
	three. Kammy picked her robe up by the hem and performed a dance,
	holding them up for five minutes. Kamek would not allow them to
	leave her behind.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;WHAT'S
	THE POINT OF THIS?!&quot; Bowser exploded.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kammy
	concluded, patting the sweat off her forehead with a stank face.
	&quot;Bring rain, Lord Bowser. It will be a wash out. It takes time
	for effect but it will come ROLLING in and it will bring your
	minions with it!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bowser
	yawned, highly skeptical. The magikoopas didn't have their scepters
	anymore than his hammer bros their hammers, or his koopas and
	goombas their Mario-brother-obliterating-on-contact force fields.
	They were pretty darn sad wandering around, disoriented without
	landmarks. Eventually the only arial baddie present volunteered. The
	paragoomba Hippity Hop was a nervous flier, but Roy inventively used
	his Koopa Ball winning throws to launch him in the air. The baddie
	wailed on the way up and down. After many rounds he regretted
	signing up for, Hippity flew erratically in a northerly direction.
	They followed the dot in the sky all the way to a village.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Some of
	the Troop cheered prematurely as they dispersed into the semi-rural
	neighborhood, air redolent of recently stirred dust and nothing
	else. No pungent whiffs of burnt materials, no sickening odor of
	death. The stone construction homes were empty, no movement until
	reaching a tall purple bloodwood tree, ragged scraps of cloth and
	other unrecognizable strings swinging limply from its branches.
	Hippity landed at the base of it.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;King!
	(Darn it, I was tryina get away from you lunatics..) I found someone
	up there!&quot; he straightened up and reported.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Ooh
	ooh ooh I can assist!&quot; Morton barged ahead, knocking Hippity
	aside. He gripped the trunk and shook the tree out its roots. Roy
	griped something about the wrong technique until a body splat on the
	floor. The koopas gathered at the lakitu in a weathered balaclava,
	J.D. otherwise known as Bowser's eleventh sentry.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;We
	have another casualty, Lord Bowser,&quot; Kamek lamented.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Weakly,
	Sentry 11 rolled himself over, flashing them a smile with a tooth
	missing. &quot;Not yet. Always of service.. Boss. And good thing you
	sent.. Prince Lawrence&hellip; away.&quot; He unballed his fist and
	a paper tumbled out, bumping Junior's toe.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	six-year-old couldn't read it; they didn't teach that style in
	school anymore. Bowser however pored over the cursive easily,
	especially since he wasn't the one who scribbled it.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
	dropped onto a granite rock for a breather, his head spinning so
	wildly he was amazed it remained attached. The trio made it
	uneventfully one of three bordering kingdoms of Dark Land. Sky Land
	was lush and cheery, a facsimile of the Mushroom Kingdom, only less
	developed and with an extra abundance of thick clouds and lots of
	monuments in seemingly random spots. He knew why the princess
	insisted on this route. Pipe Land and Ice Land with their oceans and
	chilling weather or tricky navigation, possessed complications not
	worth adopting. At all.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The way
	the princess paced nervously ahead, he knew it was time to move
	again. The Chancellor was proving to be extra baggage, literally as
	Larry carried him over his shoulder. The princess would offer to
	help but he was too much a gentleman, see. At least he was for
	today..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	followed her downhill through knee high grass. The terrain consisted
	of identical hills, like they were stuck in a looping auto scroller,
	the only references indicating otherwise being the valley areas
	where clouds dipped and created foggy white barriers impenetrable to
	the eye. All Peach did was march along. Any of his questions beget
	an abashed or somber response. He didn't know what had went down
	from their letters back and forth to now. Well, the castle went
	down, but what did she care? What did Larry even care? His physical
	belongings were gone which sucked hard, but he already had an online
	friend to crash with later. It'd be great to be away from their old
	Koopa Dynasty artifacts and treasures, like the dragon koopa eating
	its own tail. That Ouroboros was his least favorite for sure, not to
	mention he just plain didn't get it.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A buzz
	went off from within his shell. It was his old junky phone ringing
	from a weird caller id that appeared to be a jumbled up URL.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hey
	it's.. uh.. L4rry if you're a cute girl, nonyabusiness if you
	ain't.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Lol,
	you'll make an exception for me won't you? It's Lemmy. We can talk
	because your handmedown had this high technical sciencey thing!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-The
	Darklandian space communications protocol, SCPS-SP, using voice over
	IP as instituted when Mayor Koton was elected in Neo Bowser City,&quot;
	the other person stridently filled in, &quot;fully operational
	because I assisted in the development! Dang, I should have earned
	royalties by now..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Never
	before were Lemmy and Iggy so pleasant to hear, though it was funny
	about that network coming in clutch. People at school would clown
	you for using that. Meant you couldn't afford the Mushroom centric
	brands..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
	retrieved the phone. &quot;Anyway, Larry are you okay? Crazy stuff
	happened last night.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
	checked for Peach. She'd left him behind somewhat, reading a stone
	obelisk or monument ahead. &quot;I'm alright. Where you all at?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;We're
	way up in a tower using Iggy's headset to see you from like a
	million miles away. Okay not that much. Where's King Dad and
	everyone else?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
	hesitated. &quot;Finding folks. Is Luddy with y'all? Cause that'll
	be the last of the family missing.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yep!
	We'll explain it all. Keep going north. K. Bye.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yo,
	don't hang up on me!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Did
	you bring an ac adapter?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;..No.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Gotta
	conserve batteries!&quot; Lemmy concluded wryly. &quot;Iggy hasn't
	completed the solar charger yet.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
	eagerly ran forth to rejoin Peach, zoned out. The koopaling felt
	some of his hairs rise, about to shake her out of it when he was
	called again.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Update!
	King Dad's dumbphone had this feature too! Good thing it was from a
	local brand. Plus Luddy woke up.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;He
	was unconscious?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Uh-

	that great?... Larry?... Hello?&quot;</font></p>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Parakarry
	and Booigi hovered before an unmarked building East of Toad Town.
	Pedestrian and mushroom guard alike passed them by many times. Many
	seemed to be heading to Royal Raceway for a reason the mail carrier
	couldn't fathom. This entire scenario was pretty cursed from the
	start. To think that the public would turn on Mario? To think that
	Parakarry's resistance to that would get him noticed by a third
	party that he'd never known existed in Toad Town despite living here
	his entire life? That he'd get stuffed into a trunk at least twice?
	Should have called in sick..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yes

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Booigi.&quot;</font></p>

	of course. You know I never get an address wrong.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
	entered a dark square room. The wood floor was hollow, evident when
	the parakoopa dropped to his feet and knocked on one of the blank
	walls.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A hidden
	panel slid to the side. &quot;Password? -Ugh it's you. Forget the

	that are out of action, and I don't tell the King's guards that you
	helped Mario escape. Your next task isn't until 16:05 unless,
	actually..&quot; The man rummaged around in the void behind the
	wall. &quot;There you go. Get it to so and so by 14:45. Scram.&quot;
	He tossed a wrapped conical package Parakarry's way, bopping off of
	him and plunking to the floor.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I'm
	done being blackmailed. What's the aim of your organization?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A bamboo

	the secret telegram.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Spy Guy
	shrugged them off. &quot;Internal matters. Nothing to do with your
	orders. The King taking over affects us too you know.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;He-&quot;
	Parakarry brought the paper back. &quot;He's definitely doing that?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;He's
	definitely sending one of his best reps. Investigation's pending.
	You got what you wanted??&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No.
	I'm not your new fetchperson yet,&quot; Booigi declared dapperly.</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Booigi's
	first task was just a bit daunting if they were themselves, but
	trivial in their current state. The guards that once left them
	cowering were mere obstacles to phase through now. Booigi in fact
	did that a couple of times which left the victim dazed, not that
	they ever turned back to revel. Around the Lil Oink farm were posted
	pink banners from before, recruitments for upcoming 'palace'
	service. Odd. There were a lot of little eggs gathered behind the
	pens, the farmer not collecting yet. That ignited a spark for the
	boo, a clash of memories from both halves of the duality. They did
	make an additional friend yesterday. Also famously green.</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Hello.
	Who is this? ..Well, Mr. or Mrs. Unknown Number, I'm judicious about
	sharing mine so I certainly know you?&quot; The caller's voice was
	professional if a little phlegmed up, heavily accented even like an
	old Mushroomite from the more rural locations where well-to-do
	citizens lived in classical mushroom homes on large forestry plains,
	contently alienated from the urbanization of Toad Town.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Why
	aren't you here, Mr. Munchakoopas?&quot; Booigi realized they'd
	better try to speak like Boo more. Needed more ellipses in there.
	And more 'likes'.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Ah.
	I've never heard you over the line before, Boo!&quot; he laughed.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Answer
	the question! ..I mean.. the princess is k-kidnapped.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi's
	gasp was followed by the clash of a shattered dish in the background
	and animal barking. &quot;Excuse me..&quot; The barking subsided. &quot;I
	refused to believe that was the culmination of our adventure
	yesterday! Don't pull my leg. I know I was told to leave and I've
	been here on the Island disconnected from-&quot; The speaker made a
	brushing sound. More distantly, Booigi heard the dinosaur mutter,
	&quot;What is she doing back already? Oh hel-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	thought we agreed to not let Poochy indoors?&quot; It was husky yet
	feminine, Birdo's.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Rustling

	Click.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Alirght,

	whizzed by the lost dislodged consciousness, driven by the desire to
	become reunited with his physical manifestation. That was
	improbable- he knew that, but the only thing propelling him through
	the unfathomably vast heavens, withstanding the pelt of star bits,
	escaping the tug of black holes, thoroughly scanning galaxies for
	sentient activity, until he could find ANYONE of assistance.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	school of lumas traveling in dense formations were likely not, bless
	their little hearts though for tying.. He encountered them around
	some prankster comet and they bustled like busy children chattering.
	A purple luma presented him with unintelligible squeaks, doing what
	appeared to be an imitation of his bombastic father to bemuse him.
	It spun rapidly on its axis and transformed into a sling star,
	shooting him through the galaxy.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He landed
	hard on a grey mass the size of a small meteor, oblong with jagged
	giant bones jutting the ground. That startled him to his feet.
	Plaques and graveyard stones were embedded, a near sun bleaching it
	all in red, including a body laying against one of them, a boo
	intact except for one of their arms severed from the elbow down. An
	inch above where the sinew was broken was a marking, a Koopa Troop
	tattoo, except the temporary ones they gave to temps.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The boo
	jolted upright. &quot;AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!&quot;
	the other shrieked in return for a solid minute.</font></p>

	Ludwig?&quot; Zoo Diddley questions.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;The
	one and only- Oof!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zoo wrung
	him by the neck and dragged him down to his level. &quot;Your
	soldiers burnt down my home! Your brothers scared Sam and Slam out
	of their shop so I couldn't even get revenge on them for roping me
	into your crap! Then YOU followed me out of the kingdom, shot at me,
	and stole my most prized possession! Now we're here. This isn't even
	limbo, bro. We're space junk!&quot; He shoved the disembodied
	koopaling away. Ludwig tripped over a stone and fell on his butt,
	amazed and frightened at once at how Zoo succeeded at giving him a
	pain response, or any response when nothing conclusively had until
	this point.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
	mustn't see it that way! I summoned you with the intention of
	acquiring your account. In the chance-medley I was mentally
	compromised and lost track of the team I sent to catch you...&quot;
	he trailed. &quot;Did you locate Star Temple?&quot; he sprung forth.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The dark
	boo stared off into space irritably. &quot;Nah. I don't wear a skin
	suit to scrub marble floors! I remember when my family moved from
	some awesome big house to a backwoods cabin to keep weirdos like me
	away from everybody!&quot; he crudely laughed at himself. &quot;I
	always vowed I'd be back to that standard someday. Drew did after
	all.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I'm
	not seeking it for occupation!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Good.
	I need something full-time that'll give me weekends. How else will I
	find time to kill people, and or co-workers?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Uh.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Go
	join Sam already. When &#9825;&#9834;!? comes patrolling around
	again, he can piss off too.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	gulped hard, a vestige reflex when he was literally not in mortal
	danger. Thank whatever stars were still watching that he got out of
	the entertainment business where he might encounter people like
	Lemmy. He found that 'Sam' person, noticing movement behind a column
	of bones. Ludwig located the Chancellor of the Mushroom Kingdom soon
	enough at the more pointed edge of the planetoid. 'Samuel'
	Toadsworth appeared as himself, dressed spiffily, with his cane
	standing and even waiting patiently as if his Sunday morning ride
	would show anytime soon to pluck him from this icky deathly place
	and shuttle him down to the quaint little market.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Bygones
	are bygones, young man,&quot; he preemptively told Ludwig as there
	was a dazzling light at the far corner of the planetoid.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Roger.
	Yeah, oh, scratch that, we have three lost souls now,&quot; droned
	the being into his receiver. Ludwig had to remember to fix his eyes
	a certain way, so as to perceive his form. It was a star warrior
	larger than any of the little stars he'd encountered until now. &quot;I
	need to get you cats to the Grandmaster Galaxy by 893:033.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Screw
	you!&quot; Zoo yelled from the other side.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The star
	warrior shook his head in pity. &ldquo;Think that dealio over. Your
	physical bodies aren&rsquo;t empty vessels out there like they&rsquo;re
	supposed to be. &lsquo;Miss Rosie&rsquo; said she&rsquo;ll show up
	and discuss-&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hullo!
	C-could we revisit that earlier point?&rdquo; Toadsworth inquired. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Don&rsquo;t
	care!&rdquo; Zoo yelled again. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Something
	or someone meddled with you all before you three-&rdquo; the star
	warrior (&#9825;&#9834;!?) made a chopping motion. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s
	as far as I can tell you now. Don&rsquo;t worry about that one. We
	can leave him. He has forever to get over that attitude. In this
	sector of space, time is loopy.&rdquo;</font></p>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Need
	another round of 'Hillbilly Hail' on the double, pard!&quot; yelled
	one nurse to the other. Shortly more buckets of ice water were
	passed along.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
	watched the half-naked Mario brothers get drenched to cool their

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;What

	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">..The

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jon

	retrieved the pink flier from where it lay on the passenger seat and
	reread it over: </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&lsquo;Pubic

	Royal Raceway, Toad Town&rsquo; </font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">.
	Feeling like she was in a pit deeper than Glitzville&rsquo;s, she
	let it slip to the floor.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
	event was going to have a turnout surpassing a Star Festival! It was
	conjecture that the Mushroom King wanted to bring fresh faces to his
	palace at Poshley Heights, spooked by how easily the Koopa Troop
	could snatch his daughter from under Mario&rsquo;s nose practically,
	but she wasn&rsquo;t going to be there to document any official
	proceedings it if she couldn&rsquo;t even beg Peach&rsquo;s castle
	toads for permission while they were cooped up in that hideous Hotel
	Mario. She was forbidden by Snifit Patrol and league. The snufit
	even threatened that if he wasn&rsquo;t stationed to guard the
	castle grounds, he&rsquo;d do something about that &lsquo;stolen&rsquo;
	kart she was driving. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
	left- Well she wasn&rsquo;t so keen on Kinopio-Kun&rsquo;s blog.
	Digital territory was uncharted. She had dyslexia, that is how she
	obtained her reputation for daringly jumping into the middle of
	everything. Way easier to write about it if you were there compared
	to skimming through other sap&rsquo;s experience. Poor excuse.. That
	didn&rsquo;t stop her writing her Koopa Kronicle or a whole gosh
	darn novel. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It was
	time to hunt around for the web browser icon on her phone and check
	it out. Kinopio was a PR person whose content as an &lsquo;influencer&rsquo;
	was flagrantly monitored by the Toadstools. How could Kylie forget
	when a person she was dating at the time- regrettably, was the
	reason that contemporary position was invented in a place as hoary
	as the Mushroom Kingdom.</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">NO
	you can&rsquo;t see her!!&rdquo; Jon shouted down another visitor.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">But
	it&rsquo;s just a package. That&rsquo;s too much to accept?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jon
	rolled his eyes at the woman. &ldquo;Could be dangerous, eh,&rdquo;
	he said, twirling the yellow flattish bubble mailer around. It was
	addressed to the &lsquo;Castle Manager&rsquo; in cut and glued
	newspaper letters.. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Just like
	a psycho would do! The deliverer, Boo, anxiously followed every
	movement as they didn&rsquo;t even know its contents.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It
	woulda blown up by now, haha..&rdquo; Bridget quipped. She got
	whacked again. &ldquo;I wish Ben was still here. You suck!&rdquo;
	she shot back.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	pressed the packet onto her. &ldquo;Then leave me alone and take
	care of that.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie was
	about ready to jump out and hurt somebody when Boo ran off down the
	sidewalk. Instead she struck the push button ignition and pulled
	off. The boo twisted around as Kylie cracked her window.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Psst.
	Some of those King&rsquo;s guards make ya wanna commit treason,
	don&rsquo;t they? You okay? Hop in.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thank
	you, Miss Kylie.&rdquo; Boo thought the sleek Aston Mushroom
	interior was &lsquo;off the chain&rsquo;! Or did people still say
	that? Kylie drove off again in the slowest gear.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Let
	me cut to the chase. Kinopio-Kun has his &lsquo;pms&rsquo; or
	whatever disabled &lsquo;n I NEED executive admission to that public

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Luigi
	what?! He.. bragged on Boo?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo
	pretended to look out the window as their face heated up. &ldquo;Just
	speak to Mr. Kinopio. He&rsquo;s at MK East. I know because
	Parakarry had a few sympathy cards for him.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The blue
	toad marked on his little task list from Jr. Troopa(?), he didn't
	pay attention to the RPG folk too much, that he snagged from a
	counter at the S. hospital. You could take a toad out of the castle,
	but not the castle out of a toad. Here he was occupying himself with
	anything to not go crazy, including volunteer nursing duties. He
	escorted Dr. Toad to an overgrown plot of land with a wooden barn
	painted deep red. And unexpectedly large metal shutter door took up
	the entire front wall. Despite that the doctor beside him, cityboy
	as he appeared made no comment- or eye contact. The gate rose by six
	inches, bushy green leaves rustling against it.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Howdy.
	Hold it. I don&rsquo;t know yer smell..&rdquo; the hoarse leafy
	person said.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
	suspiciously turned to the nurse who shrugged and answered, &ldquo;Umm.
	I&rsquo;m wearing new cologne? So here is Dr. Toad. You know. The
	guy. On the list.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...Nailed
	it pard!&rdquo; they laughed knowingly. Their shaking branches
	activated something inside the barn that was close to the door. A
	shrill noise and flash went off causing something to explode in
	there. Smoke billowed from under the gate.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Whoa,
	what the freaking heck??&rdquo; the nurse laughed as well.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Don&rsquo;t
	mind it. A Mecha-Yoshi needs a tweak.&rdquo; Vick slid a beige old
	looking telephone under the door.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The nurse
	smirked at the doctor that had leapt high in the air and landed in
	his arms after the blast. &ldquo;..Can I put you down now?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">From the
	first magnanimous greeting from &lsquo;Mr. X&rsquo;, the nurse knew
	he was someone that wasn&rsquo;t always a Mushroomite, but was now.
	Dr. Toad stuttered through simple stuff like his name, which he
	blurted out initially as Drew L. Diddley-</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~Where
	had that been seen before?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-The
	doctor swiftly corrected that his professional title was Dr. Toad
	and the CEO remained patient and kind through the rest of that
	stilted call. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A coldish
	hand surprised the nurse on his shoulder. &ldquo;Complete.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	&lsquo;nurse&rsquo; lifted his head, having tuned out. &ldquo;Y-yeah?
	Yeah. What time is it?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
	raised his right wrist, raising one eyebrow. &ldquo;Three-Twenty
	Eight. Did I loiter?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	gasped. &ldquo;No, just take two lefts, a right, a left again, right
	right left, backwards, forwards. Then you&rsquo;re there. Bye!&rdquo;
	The blue toad broke into a sprint, his medical mask flying off. The
	round face of Bucken-Berry flushed deeply. If he didn&rsquo;t reach
	the ICU in two minutes he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to see his friend
	Ala-Gold again before the planned last-ditch surgery.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Even if

	secretary Jr. Troopa habitually passed out. She joined the gaiety of
	the unorthodox ice bucketing procedure for the Mario brothers. The
	supervising Jr. Troopa was mindful of the spectators that weren&rsquo;t
	his staff, leaning over the thin picket fence surrounding a small
	spot with hay fiber substrate and crowing as if they were watching a
	petting zoo at that. This was serious! Luigi silently endured his

	Troopa paled. He wrote a note on scrap paper, handed it to the
	nearest nurse, and departed with the noki. His absence brought on an
	immediate shift, especially when the podoboo toting the note
	scorched it by mistake. The ranchers and villagers began to press
	inwards on the Marios in curiosity.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Ain&rsquo;t
	that there Mario fella wanted up North?&rdquo; they&rsquo;d say.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The air
	stirred next to Luigi. His brother bolted and he did too.
	Unfortunately the fence wasn&rsquo;t just for hecklers, but a
	barrier from all sorts of dangers, like the thing that made Mario
	ten paces ahead vanish. Luigi stopped just in time and leaned over
	the precipice. His brother uncontrollably tumbled down a metal
	drainage half pipe. Without thinking he plunged with him. They were
	ejected miles away on damp clay like soil. They rolled to a stop
	against a copper colored wall.<br/>
&hellip;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
	locomotive horn jolted Luigi awake. The next thing Luigi remembered
	was a tall metal water tower glinting in the sunlight. He rolled and
	saw a jagged rock of Mt. Rugged. The K64 station was known to be up
	there somewhere. Something else ensnared his attention then, his
	brother quivering next to him.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">M-mario!?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Remaining
	curled up, he held a discolored spot on his forehead. &ldquo;Ouch.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	crawled over, ignoring the painful rocks. &ldquo;Bro. This is so
	bad. I mean I&rsquo;ll get you help but- oh man. I wanted us to get
	to Bowser Castle before dark!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	lifted upwards. On closer inspection he was otherwise okay, aside
	from tattered clothes. &ldquo;You can be there pronto with The
	Captain. Cool Blue is busy.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	woefully plopped beside him. &quot;Scratch that proposition. Weren't
	you coming??&quot; At his brother's silence, he scooped up and slung
	a rock hard against the mountain face. It made a faint thunk.
	&quot;Mario, a shortcut to World 8 isn't even that far from here.
	Come on, we made it out of Toad Town against all odds. Don't you
	see? Everyone will see you're helping and -Oh look so you aren't
	secretly villainous like the stupid tabloids say! PR disaster
	averted and you can finally retire in peace. I'm supposed to be
	doing the legwork right? So.&quot; He choked up. &quot;Go with me.
	Please. I don't want to do this without you..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	expected to turn and see something ugly. Instead Mario's palm was on
	his forehead. &quot;Yep.. Everything you're thinking, yep. The
	message-boards, the commentators, they're also right on one thing.
	In the midst of this, I was infatuated with my rival!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The world
	seemed to melt around the green plumber, muttering to himself, &quot;Mio
	fratello mi ha detto.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Yeah,
	and it's over. Or- er, it's not going to cloud my judgement ever
	again.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	stood up, face to face with him.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Bowser
	not caring.. sometimes it's admirable, but he doesn't know limits.
	We do, and he's seventeen years older than us. Bout time he learns
	this lesson.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	smiled cathartically. &quot;Of course.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Need
	a moment?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Nah,
	big bro.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">As they
	retraced their path using that deathtrap drainage thing as a
	zigzagging guide, Mario as usual filled the air primarily, though
	something was different about his dryish humor and definitely the
	topic. Luigi assumed he was purging the senselessness he could
	during this half time- the sort of episodes their games skipped.
	They came upon a fractured concrete podium in the middle of nowhere,
	labeled ostro stop in a western font. It seemed to be targeting
	citizens departing the K64 as a pole with a wire from it leading to
	a powerline was stamped with bulletins and flyers from businesses
	and events in town.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Hey,
	what was the draw?&quot; Luigi asked as Mario spammed a buzzer for
	service.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	brightened in recollection. &quot;Strength. Ambition. Esteem for
	family. Cooking.. I know.. And if you're in that narrow range that
	he cares about he's super fair. His bottom line is that you can do
	what he wants you to do, not who or what you are.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	see.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yeah.
	...Luigi, thank you for listening. You coulda reacted a lotta ways
	and I'd deserve it, so thanks for your patience too. You had
	yourself figured out way before me...&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A great
	feeling in turn waft over the younger brother. &quot;Mario, no.
	Thank you for letting me.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~He'd
	promised he'd never get resentful long ago, and it wasn't going to
	change now, whether over a trivial or mountain sized dispute. It
	wasn't like anything in this life would top their Papa giving Mario
	both brass keys to their plumbing shop. If they were Cain and Abel
	before then, that sealed it- he thought at least. They never shared
	a shift. They lived on opposite sides of Brooklyn even. And that
	wasn't easy then. Luigi just happened to pick up the phone and come
	over like his brother begged when 'something freaky was going on
	with the pipes'. Mario wasn't usually that humble to admit he
	couldn't fix things. Well, through all they'd been to get here, on
	the cusp of forty and each other's best friend, he'd gotten that
	brass key, and there was </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">nothing</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">
	holding him back.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-I
	heard it the first time, dern it! It's busted.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	sheepishly lifted his finger from the buzzer. Staring at the back of
	the red shelled koopa in a blue janitorial jumper, dithering over
	which broom to reach for in his service cart, it was clear how he'd
	appeared on the spot so stealthily.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;They
	made you fly out here to tell us? Cabbie or not, I almost feel I
	should compensate you anyway.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He peeped
	over his shoulder again, staggering in recognition. &quot;Shoot..&quot;
	He dropped the broom. &quot;Howdy, I'm Probabilly K. Listen here,
	our local wacko Vick, bless his heart, sprout these here stops
	evrywhere' without using high speed cabling to the signal box. I can
	help ya out anyway, specially this un.&quot; He lifted his right
	arm's sleeve to the elbow, revealing a faded with age L emblem
	tattoo. &quot;Us less popular siblings gotta stick for one nuther.
	Whatcha need Mr. Hero?...&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;...Oh,
	right, me. We appreciate it,&quot; Luigi spoke up, awkwardly.
	&quot;Here's what we're doing...&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">As his
	brother spoke to the old parakoopa, Mario processed how light his
	chest felt. Asthma be darned, it was easier to breathe if all of
	these invisible problems weren't like a millstone around his neck.</font></p>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The blue
	pianta bellhop rose from the binocular stand. &ldquo;Yikes. It&rsquo;ll
	be gnarly, sir.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The other
	pianta, Hotel Delfino&rsquo;s day supervisor, waddled over to the
	parapet with him, squinting and shielding his face from the sun
	partially. The shimmering Dolphin Ocean stretched out as far as one
	could see, marred only by some darkness on the horizon. &ldquo;Feel
	it in the bones too, brah.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Not
	that, sir.&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">About a
	nautical mile away, there were two sumo bros drifting in a leaking
	foam inflatable raft surrounded by hungry sushi. One of the
	eccentrically clothed twins was a bump on a log while the other
	steadily pumped out water. Behind them was a mound of objects
	covered by a black tarp, strapped to the raft with cords.
	Unambiguously to the piantas, that was what weighed them down. </font>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sammy
	snapped out of his half nap and rubbed his eyes under his plastic
	helmet, sweat rolling down his black shell and onto his matching
	cape. &quot;Wowzers. Are there yet?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	younger dragon/koopa Slamondon chored himself to acknowledge him.
	&ldquo;Nay. Not enough drag accounted for in thy math as usual,&rdquo;
	he groaned. He held the hem of his magikoopa robe to tip toe towards
	their luggage. He was also a hardcore enthusiast, much like Sam was
	of sci-fi supervillain Darth Koopa from </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Star
	Slammers</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">,

	no no bro, don&rsquo;t do that! Lemme do </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">my</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">
	thing. Ommmmmm!&rdquo; Sam squeezed his eyelids shut and plugged
	both ears. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	milquetoast younger brother sat his uncomfortably wet tush down and
	bide. The trip from Neo Bowser City so so-called paradise vacation
	was in complete turmoil. At this stage in life, a semester away from
	graduation, Slam despised his role as his brother&rsquo;s sitter.
	While Sam could divine the most absurd and find the hypotenuse in a
	blink, he had not mastered tasks of an elementary sort, like paying
	light bills on time. Otherwise, Slam could have taken his forty
	percent share of their Play-N-Tirade franchise and ran off to open
	the renaissance park he always wanted. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A jet ski
	tore through the waters, tearing him from that reverie. The rider
	aimed around a handheld harpoon to scare away the sharks. &ldquo;Aloha.&rdquo;
	She waved, a cute gal in a purple patterned bikini, white flowery
	necklace draped loosely over her shoulders. &ldquo;Need help?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Aye
	f-fair madame,&rdquo; Slam stammered, blushing. &ldquo;Saveth us, we
	have bountiful treasures aboard this ship!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sam
	peeped one eye open with a smug grin. &ldquo;-Oh hi totally hot
	lifeguard I summoned.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">~Actually
	Hotel Delfino called me on you two, hehe.&rdquo; She dropped the
	charade and murmur. &ldquo;(Cause if it was YOU calling me on you, I
	wouldna shown up.)&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sam gave
	her a tauntingly dorkish laugh. &ldquo;Suuure? I dunno, I just felt
	like being rescued by a &lsquo;Valerie&rsquo;. 27. Born in a winter
	month like Rebmeced? Who studies finance abroad at Mushroom Collage
	and just bought a B-Dasher in red and whose boyfriend just got
	arrested for...&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Her jaw
	dropped expression mirrored Slam&rsquo;s. His brother&rsquo;s hubris
	never led to anything easily undone.</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
	happened, brah??&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
	you don&rsquo;t know why five of our lifeguards fainted like that?
	Eh, whatever, brah. I have a backup on call. Welcome to Hotel
	Delfino!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	bellhop held the door open for the dripping wet sumo bros, inviting
	them into the moodily lit lobby inundated with waiting vacationers
	of all sorts. Slam got them onto land in the first place by stuffing
	his brother&rsquo;s mouth with one of those body pillows so that he
	couldn&rsquo;t freak out the six rescuer in a row. By then however,
	the twelve o&rsquo;clock checkouts were out and these innumerable
	other folk were ready to pounce. The sumo bros were prompted to
	utilize the ticket dispenser.</font></p>

	and on, bleeding off the receipt paper in red ink.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sam slid
	up his glasses, too adept at calculations to fathom that number
	waiting in here, let alone the entire hemisphere. It had to be a
	glitch. Slam caught a devious gleam behind his brother&rsquo;s
	naturally cloudish eyes and detected trouble, redux! </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The desk
	receptionist stamped documents in a tray. &quot;Hey. Don&rsquo;t
	come up brah, unless your number-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sam
	slapped down the error ticket, puffing out his thick chest. &ldquo;But
	we&rsquo;re reserved for sho. Prospectors straight outta
	Goldbobbington's. We gotta comb the beach and our bodies are ready.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The stamp
	slipped from the pianta&rsquo;s mits.. &ldquo;Ooooh that, my
	apologies sir, I remember everything you are talking about.&rdquo;
	He cradled a landline phone between his shoulder and neck while
	simultaneously clacking on his computer. &ldquo;I will find space,
	sir. Uh, please in the meantime help yourself to the bar. On the
	house. Mention my name.&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sam broke
	off to the adjacent tiki bar, taking up two stools as he ordered one
	of everything. As the bartender worked away Slam sat beside him,
	struggling to find the stool with the neon lights everywhere.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	dare say you dazzle even me now,&rdquo; he whispered in his ear. He
	cherished these magical moments when that giant gob of Sam&rsquo;s
	actually did something favorable. -Like when Sam manipulated that
	dark boo reporter into passing around Fungus Up yesterday. They were
	out that wretched Toad Town so quickly it was like they&rsquo;d
	dropped a potion at their feet and they went &lsquo;poof&rsquo;.
	Slam propped his elbow on the bar and leaned on it, not a partaker
	of the &lsquo;dizzying elixirs&rsquo; as he put it, watching the
	sports bar tv on MKNN. On the bottom banner, intertwined with stalk
	market data, it mentioned &lsquo;Public Address&rsquo; at Toad Town
	today. Blech!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sam
	slammed his empty glass down. &ldquo;Urp! .. Hey, lemme have our
	shop wire our Princess Parlor profits over.&rdquo; His fat fingers
	dialed their Play-N-Tirade number as additional fruity looking
	cocktails were lined up for him. &ldquo;No answer, but coolio I&rsquo;ll
	leave a message. Now, let&rsquo;s catch up with Iggster!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Once upon
	a time, Sky Land was known as the kingdom with the most marvelous
	view of the stars. As the composition of the atmosphere changed,
	those celestial bodies were blotted gradually. Increasingly common
	cloud coverage draped their land and their spirits. One day the
	people channeled all their might, one-hundred laborious years, to
	reach the astral realm they revered and contain it for themselves
	with a spiraling limestone tower taller than any before. The King
	and his domestics from greatest to least discarded their terrene
	life. The tower was thus made inaccessible from intruders and the
	land at its base to go rural, though it could still be seen near the
	coast. It was known as an impervious but awesome sight.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
	Koopa brought it into focus from another altitudinous, but not
	nearly as much, tower of enemy origin a few miles away with a
	coin-operated telescope. Iggy&rsquo;s VR headset ran out of power.
	The lankier younger brother would know, because he swapped the
	battery from it to his cellphone to keep it running a little longer.
	It paid off when it chimed suddenly of &lsquo;Super Plumber Sonata&rsquo;,
	his ringtone from Koopa Ball Z. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He took
	one step- and forgot his leg was sprung. He tripped forward,
	knocking the cellular phone off of the rail and down the very long
	staircase below. It flumped around for what felt like five minutes. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
	stared down the shaft long enough to get vertigo.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
	totally okay Lemmy-sama. I had an intemperate glass installed.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
	mean temperate glass?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">No.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
	turned to him with concern. &ldquo;Is your head still feeling
	funny?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yep.
	Still a scratched DVD suffering loss of data integrity and
	sputtering right before the best part.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">..Maybe
	Ludwig on the ground floor is doing better..&rdquo; The rainbow hair
	koopaling shrunk another inch. He was praying he wouldn&rsquo;t have
	to be the sole one to break it to Larry, Bowser, virtually everyone
	about last night.</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">At the
	Hotel Defino tiki bar, there was nothing going on except for Sammy
	winning coins in bets over guessing stranger&rsquo;s underwear
	colors.<br/>
Embarrassed second hand, Slam lifted his hood over his
	head. Thunder was rumbling and through one window he saw staff
	chaining down the beach chairs outside. Solar sensing night lights
	were scattered on the beach. Meanwhile, Sam&rsquo;s phone buzzed on
	the counter from Iggy&rsquo;s number. He picked it up.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Y
	O U R P U N I S H MENT I S IM M I N E NT,&rdquo; stabbed through one
	ear and exited the other. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">With a
	deafening thunder crack everything went completely dark.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Palm
	trees were twisting, rain was beating on the windows, and a group of
	petrified beach goers clambered indoors as the building moaned and
	creaked under high winds. The last of which, a yoshi flopped to the
	floor panting.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">High&hellip;ground
	man&hellip;high ground.. NOW!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	waiter felt her way around. &ldquo;Alright. Bar closed.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Slam
	obediently slid off the stool, heart thumping. He played the
	classics. Bad things happened in the Pitch Dark. He reached for Sam
	who remained slumped over the counter. Thinking he was intoxicated,
	Slam hunkered down, ready to carry him off when the emergency lights
	kicked on. The robed brother emitted a high pitched noise. From
	Sam&rsquo;s snout flowed deep crimson blood. The glimmer in his wide
	open eyes had extinguished.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">...</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Great
	to see you. My plans have evolved from wishful thinking to reality
	and your timing is impeccable.&rdquo; Dr. Toad&rsquo;s words flowed
	smoothly, eased in the presence of the associate, fire forged to be
	a pseudo &lsquo;friend&rsquo;..maybe. This one had been a member of
	the Special World Hospital from the outset, ironically as a
	detractor and somewhat benighted at that. Presently however, he was
	the only of three Dr. Toad invited that had shown up.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That&rsquo;s
	amazing, Drew.&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
	will do the talking, will you?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	hammer brother gave the toad a thumbs up.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
	proceeded to the stage, bales of hay stacked three high with rickety
	wooden boards on top, plucked fresh from Nintendo Depot. The hammer
	brother garnered an expected reaction with his loose fitting
	doctor&rsquo;s coat that he clearly rarely wore, and his attempt at
	hiding his hippyish stringy long hair in a ponytail, but he didn&rsquo;t
	combat anything. A taciturn Dr. Toad trailed with his head down,
	hands tucked into deep pockets.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Greetings
	everyone. I&rsquo;m Dr. John Topper, but you can call me Dr. T.&rdquo;
	The jabber silenced quickly at his captivatingly excitable tone. &ldquo;-
	So I&rsquo;m with Dr. Toad here from the International Medical
	University of Special World. Our institution is lucky enough to have
	a fragment of Dr. Mario&rsquo;s case study on the first outbreak of
	the Mushroom Flu. -Yeah- uh huh? ..No, you heard me. So, in light of
	that tragic Bowser attack, we have chosen to assist you the best we
	can with that matter!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
	previously critical snickering bunch erupted in praise. Without a
	proper announcement that it adjourned, many took off right away
	giddy with news.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">By
	the way it should only take forty-four hours maximum to formulate a
	new cure!&rdquo; Dr. Topper yelled at their backs essentially. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">In the
	scuttle, they bumped the rearmost observant off the stack of library
	books he was using to watch over the cowboy hats in the crowd.
	Getting up, cursing, he would have severely hurt a few if they
	weren&rsquo;t whisked away on an ostro by now. Instead, he dusted
	himself off and snapped back to his picture perfect presentation.
	Shoving the books into his backpack he dragged it to the nearest
	public bench. The longish trip back to the library was unattractive
	and the heat of direct sunlight did not bother him. </font>

	Jackson?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You

	that in a museum? How? Where?&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">An
	associate yet to arrive has it. He found it in his previous job with
	Sir Grodus.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Troopa
	gasped. &ldquo;Drew, your hiring is.. Questionable.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yes,&rdquo;
	he beamed proudly, hooking his arm through the koopa&rsquo;s. &ldquo;And
	I will tell you more about it inside.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Troopa
	seemed to play along until they reached his office door. He swung it
	open, letting a few boxes spring out over their heads. &ldquo;Oops.
	We gotta problem. No room with all your junk!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	have not set the lab up yet! Geez! ..Besides my therapist told me if
	the pathways are clear I'm not a hoarder.&quot; he trailed, the door
	shutting behind them.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The toad
	watching on the bench was just about to toss a heavy book to make
	them get a room. Thankfully they had, but now there was something
	else keeping him from diving into a green bound book.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oww!
	Hey no need to push me like that&hellip;. I don&rsquo;t keep coins
	on me if that&rsquo;s &hellip; Oh that was a rental for the
	airport.. All I have is boring medical stuff stacked here, see-?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Quit,
	before we fold ya a couple times over!&rdquo; They had a southern
	affection, yet an eerily robotic timbre. After a hollow pop lots of
	glass shattered. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The toad
	hopped off the bench and rushed toward the commotion, exhilarated by
	the call of action. Blocking the entirety of the back alley space
	were humongous amalgamations paper and metal scaffolding, one an
	effigy of a goomba and a snifit in outlaw getup. Dr. Topper,
	bleached white, was laying on top of sparkly glass shards. The
	hybrid electricity coup kart had a dent in the front matching his
	shell. The Paper Macho gang members spun at the onlooker.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Stay
	outta this.&rdquo; Barked the other one, the snifit. In spite of
	their hollow emotionless gape the malice and severity was apparent.
	The observer should back off and get some help.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-No way!
	Captain Toad pretended to take a step back, then launched his heavy
	backpack at the Macho Snifit. It fired- 'pop' 'pop' 'pop' his way,
	the high velocity cork plugs bouncing off the walls. It was too
	late, The Captain was upon him grabbing and ripping the weapon
	carrying arm from the socket. The paper pieces disintegrated in his
	palm, leaving the cap gun. The Captain fired it back at the paper
	soldier, piercing holes in through its body, snapping the metal
	skeleton and striking the 'weak point' on his back. Its form
	exploded with a blast that shot the toad backwards against the
	shanty metal tiles of the office building. The macho goomba outlaw
	standing in its partner's wake had no reaction short of fleeing the
	opposite way.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">In the
	excitement of chasing, the Captain stepped over the downed hammer
	bro absently. The outlaw barged through a wooden fence and towards a
	red barn with a breach in the sliding door from being jaggedly eaten
	into. He found inside it six foot tall dinosaur robots against the
	wall deactivated, a gaming pc with multi-monitor setup, and in the
	far rear mechanical parts from vehicles, computers, farm equipment,
	and radios in rusty piles. Matching teeth marks were all of those,
	if the outlaw discovered in the middle of the pile wasn't conclusive
	enough.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	Captain spun the pop gun around his finger. The outlaw's final
	expression as it ate cork was, again, nothing at least on the
	outside.</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jr.
	Troopa was the foremost scuttling around paranoid, paw hovering over
	his own pop gun like thing in a holster on his hip, obviously too
	late. &ldquo;Laki and I didn&rsquo;t see anything conclusive at the
	first warning man. I'm so sorry!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
	only the wind knocked out of me. I used to, well, be adventurous.
	I&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo; Dr. Topper sent away the ukiki nurse.
	&ldquo;Thank you. I should have watched my back more. It&rsquo;s my
	fault really and I&rsquo;m ready to get back on track. The integrity
	of our equipment is perfect and they never touched it. I don&rsquo;t
	know who that belongs to, however.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A Pidgit
	nurse bent at a rugged backpack. &ldquo;Sir it&rsquo;s filled with
	bricks. I mean books.. Lost and found it is!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Troopa&rsquo;s
	disquietude got the best of him and decided to clean up the glass
	and paper himself, rather than try to cajole anyone else. He dropped
	the pan to the ground and got to sweeping stiffly, when he felt eyes
	on him. Lividly he lifted his head.. </font>

	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	get it, Drew. I suck at this.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	doctor stepped closer. &quot;Those gangs are common are they not?
	How did you err?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Mismanagement.
	Between keeping this job with Mr. X and you- who's obviously doing
	something right in Special World here, I had to get my junior
	assistants on track, watching the gates, on the roads, keeping up on
	patients- it ain't working! Do I need to scream more? Make more
	checklists? What? I can take em on in a fight, but then I really
	know they won't work with me.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
	do have that surly old reputation.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Troopa
	felt slapped recalling that. &quot;Yeah, I know it takes time. Look
	I'm not hanging the saddle up Drew, just calling this day what it
	is. Bluesy.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Issue
	two, you are laterally challenged.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Short?!?
	But I'm still taller than I was!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;We
	can't control people's biases, unless you allow Morris to see you.
	He has an experiment that can make you six feet tall.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Troopa
	punched him.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oww!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Fine.
	Sorry!&quot; He koopa gave the toad doctor a big- overdue given the
	distance, bear hug, snout pressed against his pocket protector from
	that- ah hem, height distance. Also trying to feel him up. Not like
	that like that.. mostly, but from the lack of advancement there, he
	could indeed take Drew on too! Ha! Besides that could see through
	the white coat, and the doctor's undershirt had *gasp* some sort of
	bright pattern and color? Such progress from the old days..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Jackson,
	if this is your holistic approach I believe it might work!&quot;</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">By the
	time The Captain returned to the scene, what was left was mostly
	multicolored confetti, the kart, and-</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Oh.
	Hello&hellip; Blessings unto you gentlemen.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">While the
	doctor and koopa separated quickly, his face hardened at what wasn't
	there.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;That,
	uh, that was your backpack?&quot; Troopa asked. &quot;Sent to lost
	and found. Probabilly can let you into the lockbox after his back
	from the coast with Mario and-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Captain
	Toad wavered. &quot;The Marios have left?!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yeah..&quot;
	Jr. Troopa glanced over him, worriedly. &quot;You saved Dr. T, just
	now didn't ya?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	Captain locked onto a particular detail of the kart near the alley.
	&quot;And I ask only for this as compensation.&quot; He slipped into
	the driver's seat and slung that kart out of the alleyway.</font></p>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;In
	the good ol days, Billy usta drive 'round with Jimmy M. like this..&quot;
	Probabilly chattered as the tractor-like Dragonfly vehicle putt at
	its max speed. &quot;Then the coins from the inspections came rollin
	in. They upgraded in a jiffy.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Old
	mushroom rock buzzed from the AM radio. The Keptos' 'Darkness in the
	Light' got the plumbers tapping to the beat. Everyone knew Les from
	the castle recorded that solo. A lesser known fun fact, well sorta,
	Gill T. their neighbor was the bassist, a super sheltered toad these
	days.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After one
	more dune, they were at the Desert Land peninsula. They thanked the
	paratroopa and ran the rest of the way into Water Land. The sky was
	cloudless and blue, waters calm, temperature mild.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
	searched around the pier for a bit, hunting down a golden pipe.
	Toads manning the toad houses were ordered to move them ever once in
	a while. These versions went much further than normal, a five
	kingdom stretch, and weren't meant for recreational use. Just what
	the brothers feared, there was a gold ring below the depths of the
	ocean. If the coast had simply shifted over it, or if a toad was
	very diligent one day they couldn't determine. Either way, they'd
	better get ready to hold their breaths.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	gingerly placed his hat, shoes, and socks in a watertight shoulder
	bag. &quot;...Geronimo!&quot; He made a running start off the edge.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	caught up, rolling his eyes playfully. Splashing in behind him, he
	was funneled into the metal tube as well. The trip wasn't completely
	submerged, still wild and chaotic, also quite cold. He was frozen
	stiff by the time it dumped them into another red-dyed body of
	water. He defrosted, swimming to the surface-</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Ah!&quot;
	he exclaimed at the Koopa King's humongous mug- in statue form. It
	was the dislodged entrance to Bowser Castle, the sea level to the
	statue's nostrils.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Up
	here!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	pulled Mario onto the structure. The red plumber rolled on his back,
	chest heaving. The sky was red with purple clouds and it rained in a
	mildly acidic way that didn't feel too great. It was Dark Land for
	sure. There were some higher elevations here and there, a volcano
	peak, tips of trees, otherwise nothing else but murky waters.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Ugh!&quot;
	groaned an orange toad girl paddling around on a floating painting
	with a street sign. Through the discoloration it was a forgery of
	Peach's 'Lethal Lava Land', the sort of junk sold in Neo Bowser
	City.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Luigi,
	that's Bowser's fan girl! If we got on her raft, we could take the
	pipe outta here.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;We
	want to leave?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	shrugged. &quot;Whatever happened here, Bowser's not around. I know
	it. Hey! (What was it?).. Emery!!!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	anxiously watched the girl turn around. Their golden pipe sprout
	from a dark cloud in the sky, ending about ten feet above the water,
	ready to time out and fade any moment. If Mario couldn't reason with
	this toad crazy enough to become a KT minion, they'd be stranded on
	that ugly replica of Bowser.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Mario??
	Luigi??&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yeah.
	Let us ride with you. I'll tell you a secret Bowser fact.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No
	thanks. We're like enemies now, and King can tell me whatever!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	hesitated. &quot;He wouldn't tell you about his brother..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">And he
	almost had her. He saw that twinkle in the eye. Too bad, he
	suspected he'd offered too quickly. &quot;I don't believe you,&quot;
	She giggled, remaining just too far for them to jump over.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Afraid
	they'd push her off the makeshift raft? No they wouldn't, but Mario
	would readily give her the 'plumber whack' if she acted up. She did
	sign up for it. Nonetheless, she held onto self-preservation unlike
	most baddies, and there wasn't a thing they could do to her except
	reason some more.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	proceeded to in a harsh guttural language, Darklandian.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	flushed. &quot;Oh.. You know that?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Toad
	taught me in the past. Yes.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;The
	Mr. Toad? He was once with the bad guys?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No,
	but you cannot understand what you cannot communicate with. If he
	was in better health, he'd tell you a lot about the culture here. He
	might even tell you that it's in your best interest to help us
	leave. You don't want to be caught letting us go, do you?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Are
	you implying you'd snitch?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	shot up next to him. &quot;You'd bet! Minions are supposed to fight
	us on sight, so get up here girl and brawl, or let us leave and
	conveniently forget we saw ya.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	squeezed her oars, glaring. &quot;I hate you and you'll so game over
	at my hands someday.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">While she
	rowed closer, Luigi subtly nudged his brother. &quot;We'd better
	watch for her...&quot;</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">When the
	Mario brothers returned to Water Land, they knew they had major
	reformulating to do. That must have been the wetter and sloppy
	Bowser Badlands they'd visited by mistake. A screw-up somewhere in
	the warp system, or-</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-Mr.
	Mario, Mr. Luigi.. Weren't you missing something on that
	expedition?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Captain
	Toad leaned against the hood of an eco-friendly bubble-shaped kart,
	his glimmering smile only making its heavy damage more suspicious.
	They stood still, puzzled. The Captain used that opportunity to
	stroll past them left and right like a little sergeant, hands
	clasped behind his back.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;..Did
	something go awry? If only you had an extra partner to accompany
	you.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	pushed past, unperturbed. &quot;Stan, Luigi and I can handle it.
	Thanks though!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	Captain stared with unbridled rage before he caught himself. &quot;But
	an adventurer needs a brigade! Besides for (spreading the blame
	during mishaps) allowing all talents to shine, extra eyes and ears
	are a protection!!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Then
	Luigi began to leave.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	Captain followed hectically. &quot;I know a way to teleport,
	straight to wherever we need to be! Including the princess!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Luigi
	found his words, turning as the red toad overtook him. &quot;And how
	is that possible, Stan?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	smirked. &quot;With your linguistic capabilities. And it's Captain
	Toad to you, </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mr.

	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He folded
	the paper up once, then again, then several more times until it was
	a tiny square in the pocket of the husk in the waiting room. The
	wait was over, and nothing could be done for Ala-Gold like he
	thought he was prepared for. The talk with his family was pleasant
	at least. Saddened, seeking to travel over Monday, the soonest they
	could, they were proud their son went down in the war against that
	evil Bowser man..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Funny, he
	used to always be jealous that Gold had a big family back at Ricco
	Harbor, and Gold in turn would tell him not to be too much. He moved
	abroad for a reason. Maybe he was onto something. Bucken-Berry's
	family never had to be stabbed by the pain of losing him.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Hey.
	You know Mr. Toad? Yes?&quot; A stern stranger, an orange yoshi in a
	tux, gave Bucken-Berry's hand a perfunctory shake, holding roses in
	his other. &quot;Where? I think my niece is close by,&quot; he
	mentioned grittily.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bucken-Berry
	pointed down a hallway, where that guy shortly went. Another visitor
	for Mr. Toad. Did anyone care about Gold like he did though? Boiling
	inside, Blue fought against the pavlovian urge to smash something.
	He should be telling the castle staff, being active. Instead he rose
	to his feet, lifted the metal chair over his head and-</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Sir
	I- Nevermind! Eeeekkk!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thomas
	screamed and ran out of the hospital entirely, which made some
	others turn and look at who remained, Bucken-Berry, like he was some
	freak. The blue toad dropped the chair and rushed outdoors as well.
	His vision blacked out from the bright sun, so that he collided face
	first into the metal sheet siding of the adjacent building. He fell
	backward into a puddle of viscous mud, toppling over a high stack of
	metal buckets with him. Many water lines were there, evident by the
	large pipes going underground and a leaky faucet.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Thomas
	stepped up slowly. &quot;I was going to say something but.. I
	f-forgot...&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bucken-Berry
	leaned upwards and glared. &quot;Chill it, kid. I wasn't gonna...
	Did I look like I was gonna? Well I wasn't. Okay? Now piss off!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Doesn't
	sound like it&hellip;. Sorry again sir.&quot; Thomas quickly backed
	off, and then changed his mind. He drew something in the soil with
	his heel. &quot;I came from there and was taken by Dark Land militia
	when I was about five. It's been tough I suppose, though it did not
	dawn how much until I came here and compared my life to your kind.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bucken-Berry
	was standing by then. There was once a such thing as sanctioned
	nomads, the reason why toads could be the exceeding demographic
	nonnative areas. Etched down there was Prism Island's crest. Talk
	about remote. &quot;I'll be frank kid. I'm not in a state to get
	into toad politics, as privileged as I still am despite my
	tragedies. More so when one of them is in that building behind us.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Mr.
	Ala-Gold, for the short time I knew him, was a cool guy.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Kid,
	duh he was! He crossed over from the harbor in a canoe he carved,
	using his homemade compass too and the stars alone. He'd memorize
	level maps and let our timer run out finding hidden blocks. Mario
	would be pissed! He had this weird thing against screaming, so how
	we clicked it off I don't know&hellip;&quot; His gaze remained on
	his muddy boots. &quot;And don't regret. Look, enough yapping.
	Where's The Captain? I got beef with him, not gonna lie, but he's
	kinda meek and quiet without his brigade. He'd probably freak you
	out less to hang with.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Oh,
	right. That was his name, I'm bad with those sir. I was with him
	before, at the public library but, he was too passionate about the
	subject.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That's
	not a real criticism according to Toadette, Bucken-Berry thought.
	Anyway, &quot;Uh huh?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yeah
	so, I haven't seen him in a while, but his backpack is right here.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Probabilly
	had returned and the lost and found items were openly displayed

	the doctor who held Dr. Mario&rsquo;s case study, there was little
	to do but roll in a Mushroom Flu patient one by one, look them up
	and down and return them where they came from in the same condition.
	For the Special World Hospital doctors, that was perhaps the closest
	they&rsquo;d been to &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; in ages. Locals began
	to murmur &lsquo;something something quack, pard&rsquo;ner&rsquo;,
	and a closely listening triage nurse suspected they weren&rsquo;t
	referring to the cataquack population. Jr. Troopa marched into the
	temporary tin shed lab, weaving and squeezing around the testbeds,
	tables with bubbling chemicals, and the hammer brother clacking at
	an old looking computer. Dr. Toad was found at the rearmost wall, at
	a clear spot he&rsquo;d carved out as his atelier. A six by four
	canvas hung at his eye level. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Jackson,
	I should recruit your blue toad nurse. I have never seen a more
	expedient associate who had yet only had the work experience of five
	minutes,&rdquo; Dr. Toad droned, etching Vick's homestead with a tan
	pastel. His right hand held the rubber band bound remainder of the
	set. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That
	didn't used to be his style. &ldquo;Erm. These are enemy species
	parts, Drew. You're the only toad. Also folks starting to gossip
	bout.. Forget it. What he look like?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Tormented,
	weathered for his age, rivaling the intensity of a Pablo Pizzacaso
	portrait, a slight unibrow, almost always downward&hellip;But
	reasonably attractive, with muscles- large ones.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Before
	Troopa could react, there was a cacophony. He jumped around at
	people barging in and barring the door closed with a spade.
	&quot;Nevermind, there's a toad right there!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr.
	Toad's playful side evaporated as Dr. Toadley and his intern
	invaded, glistening from what part of their exposed skin didn't have
	dirt stuck to it. In panic Dr. Toad barreled past Troopa and Dr.
	Topper to cut them off halfway.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Stop!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Was
	my arrival unexpected? Yes it was! We hastened, even directly
	through villager's backyards and crops. Some had shotguns.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;An
	anonymous.. delivery person has given.. us a.. Mushroom Flu virus
	sample,&quot; the intern added in between breaths.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr. Toad
	felt the ground swallow him. &quot;This was not a group effort,
	Houdini.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Jr.
	Troopa came up modestly. &quot;Uh.. I can have the boys drag em out
	if it bothers you that much.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Dr.
	Toadley chuckled. &quot;We arrive to assist, not subjugate.&quot;
	But first to assert that he was no joke either, Toadley opened his
	palm to prove the impossible. The object within scintillate.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Behold!
	At 893:044; the courthouse of Grandmaster Galaxy emerges from
	interstellar clouds of dust and gas, stationed above pillars
	staggering higher in elevation: the first of emerald, the second
	chalcedony, the third sapphire, the fourth jasper, the fifth- </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The star
	warrior careened then into the sardonyx pillar of millennia,
	bouncing off like a Micro-Goomba against a Banzai Bill. Dizzyingly
	he identified that the obscuring fog was an organic material, eating
	it away. He bustled to the golden gate of the court, ajar with a
	holographic scroll attached: </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&lsquo;The
	Galaxy Courthouse is closed at this moment. Thanketh thee.'</font></em></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">(&#9825;&#9834;!?)
	reread in disbelief, as if he might bend the words with his will
	power to state something else. &ldquo;Drats.. only thirteen minutes
	late!&rdquo; His further acceleration released his passengers from
	the suspended state they were in during his lightspeed travels.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	and Toadsworth took a rough tumble against the glass plane the
	golden Greek style coliseum rested on. The koopaling had not fully
	regained his bearings when a threatening rumble from the vastness of
	space tore his attention from his bruises. Clumps of stars engaged
	in combat, some star warriors, others macabre seafoam colored stars,
	five pointed, flatter with sunken black eyes, the source of a wispy
	particle like material all but invisible unless if overlay a lighter
	colored planet or galaxy that revealed it as pure black and
	corrosive. It made dozens of star warriors sizzle to nothing- and
	the wicked forces were advancing!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	spun to take flight, colliding with Toadsworth. They split all over
	the place, that time into the interior. The koopaling was on his
	feet in seconds and sprinted blindly for miles down narrow twisting
	and turning halls of some light emitting yellow stone like material.
	Enigmatically, he met up with a familiar face who had obviously
	never moved. The gasp that escaped his lips was the koopaling&rsquo;s
	last breath as he collapsed from exhaustion. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">See
	what rash decisions just got you?&rdquo; Toadsworth strolled up to
	his snout. &ldquo;Tut tut. The rules of our old reality don&rsquo;t
	apply. Preceding forward we must locate our guardian and get the
	gist of things in an </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">orderly</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">
	way.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A low
	growl emitted from the back of the koopaling&rsquo;s throat as he
	peeled his face from the floor. &ldquo;And why would someone of my
	caliber be frazzled, Samuel??&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	was not meddling,&rdquo; the elder replied, leading off in a random
	direction to Ludwig. &ldquo;After all, I cannot fathom how it feels
	to be snuffed out so young.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	Koopaling growled once more. That geriatric little.. And the emotion
	settled into his stomach, exhuming a poignant memory from six years
	ago: the arrival of the final sibling and the rapid sickness and
	death of their mother following. How Junior is given that very
	unique name and heired successor unprecedentedly. Ludwig slowly
	approached his father post funeral, the second that red cloaked
	stranger detached from his side, pleading for some explanation. He
	was more than old enough. He deserved it. As Bowser broke apart into
	wheezes and sniffles, he never got it. That was the impetus making
	the Koopa Troop his full time job, even over musical education. If
	he was militant enough, had grandiose enough strategies, had outside
	villain organizations recognize his efforts- could that make his
	father view him as worthy to govern his kingdom some day?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Apparently
	not. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig.
	Yo, your feet are making sparks. Pick it up!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ludwig
	was roused to (&#9825;&#9834;!?) securing him and Toadsworth by the
	wrist into a radiant open courtroom. Hamstrung, Ludwig plopped down
	in the stands, unnoticed by Toadsworth surveying with the star
	warrior for the missing goddess. Rows of vacant seating scaled as
	high as Toadsworth could crane his neck. The war had yet to tarnish
	the upper echelons of the transparent roof. He could still see
	twinkling distant stars through them, too far to wish to. The devout
	man reached inwards instead..</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	do hope this does not offend sir,&rdquo; he ventured. &ldquo;But
	have you attempted to call her?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The star
	warrior bent upwards from the judge's podium, slapping himself.
	&ldquo;..Call me Geno and duh! We just got &lsquo;em. Cut me a
	break.&rdquo; He dialed a number on a brand new looking iPhone X.
	&ldquo;Hey girl&hellip;Oh! Right on..&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Geno
	readdressed the two, pausing only a moment at the koopaling&rsquo;s
	zonked out disposition. &ldquo;Hold still and, voila!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">After a
	flash of light, the three were on a patch of grass on one of the
	islands that branched off from a central hi tech observatory
	structure with a reactor powering it. Other paths lead to living
	areas, buildings, and even schools from which lumas placidly carried
	on normal business. The sector of space here was dark blue, and
	eclectic galaxies were plainly visible in the distance. From Luigi&rsquo;s
	photos, Toadsworth registered it as the Comet Observatory, and here
	was its owner, strolling up from the center console and fumbling on
	an identical to Geno&rsquo;s phone in a way he might back on Earth,
	the elder toad was reminded ticklishly. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	intended to inform you of the new arrangements when the battles
	broke out over there (&#9825;&#9834;!?) , but could not locate the
	contacts app,&rdquo; the goddess admitted sheepishly. She tucked the
	rose gold iPhone away, giving up. She was like a living jewel before
	them, statuesque and aglow in mature beauty and grace, from her long
	platinum hair to her flawless skin, to the dazzlingly vibrant blue
	gown that extended to the floor. Despite that she sounded ordinary,
	dignified, but as any other shyish woman.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hey
	no biggie Rosie. I only remembered your digits cause I wrote in on
	my bicep the other day! Where&rsquo;s the others?&rdquo; Geno gave a
	worrying sweep of the area.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Millennium
	Star insisted on imperiling himself without specifics.&rdquo; The
	goddess explained in a hush so as to not alert lumas in proximity.
	&ldquo;There was no one else.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Geno
	groaned, reluctantly turning to his guests. &ldquo;Alright, so us
	star beings WON&rsquo;T be rolling up on &lsquo;em gangsta style.
	Rosalina&rsquo;s Gravitational Pull will have to channel you to your
	bodies.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Good
	show!&rdquo; Toadsworth exclaimed. He pat Ludwig, who&rsquo;s
	eyebrows furrowed, unreadable otherwise.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-But
	there might be glitches. Could be distance, attenuation, we dunno.
	It&rsquo;s experimental, so do ya utmost to find the dark star&rsquo;s
	leader quickly and discreetly. It gets wind of us on the case and
	it&rsquo;ll switch from games to complete annihilation. We can&rsquo;t
	afford to swoop in and miss..&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadsworth
	burst with consternation. It was only through being so well bred
	that he didn&rsquo;t jump out and seize the star warrior going,
	&ldquo;What are you mad???&rdquo; Outwardly he steely accepted like
	he was a Mushroom soldier once more, agreeing to one of the serious
	missions whose success endeared him to the Toadstool dynasty. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Coolio.
	And we&rsquo;ll watch from here..?&rdquo; Geno gave a side glance to
	Rosalina. &ldquo;Oh one more thing. A good start might be to watch
	out for &lsquo;Special Objects&rsquo;. The Dark Star had to be
	connected to one and anybody using it. It takes arcane knowledge to
	discern which are connected to good or bad stars so just don&rsquo;t
	mess with them. ..Wait a second thing actually, don&rsquo;t tell
	other people what you&rsquo;re doing because if they&rsquo;re
	connected to an &lsquo;evil&rsquo; Special Object they might like,
	try to kill you and we can&rsquo;t exactly prevent that! ..Alright,
	anything to add, Rosie?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	goddess shuddered. She&rsquo;d spent most of that time with her
	sapphire eyes trained on the koopaling. She paced over with a
	message just for him and leaned beyond his wild blue hair.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s
	not too late. Remember you are someone&rsquo;s &lsquo;Special One.&rsquo;&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif"><br/>
&hellip;<br/>
&hellip;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	sensation of choking woke Ludwig up- for real this time. The general
	coughed up murky tongue stinging water. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">How
	can BOTH of them pass out like that?! I hate everything!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry!&rdquo;
	Princess Peach rebuked. &ldquo;Stop fussing. We made it to the level
	we needed!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
	hauled Toadsworth and Ludwig into the center of the tower. There was
	a shaft with a manual powered elevator waiting for them. Just in
	time. They could hear the foaming waters sloshing on the floor
	below, even up creeping from the stairs. They hurried inside and
	spotted Lemmy far at the top. His rainbow mohawk disappeared and
	then they were shot up like a rocket, so much the basket broke at
	the top of the shaft, flinging everyone out onto the roof.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Whoops&hellip;&rdquo;
	Lemmy saw his brother continually spinning the winch. &ldquo;Iggy,
	you can stop!..&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
	rubbed his head, knocked against the parapet. &ldquo;Ouch. Thanks I
	freakin&rsquo; think..&rdquo; The flooded over landscape below sent
	a shiver down his spine. The waters were high enough to obscure the
	pillar thing in the field Peach was mesmerized by before. An airship
	sailed over the horizon, followed by additional smaller boats or
	whatever possessed buoyancy. Spontaneously a pontoon broke off from
	the others and raced up to the front ship. It had a hand weaved flag
	waving from it. A passenger from the lead ship plunged into the
	ocean.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What&rsquo;s
	Wendy thinking??&rdquo; Lemmy said, materializing next to his little
	brother. &ldquo;And I can&rsquo;t place where I&rsquo;ve seen that
	symbol before..&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
	couldn&rsquo;t cross his eyes enough to see whatever Lem could
	somehow. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t Iggster have service? Boogle it.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Lemmy
	cringed, avoiding eye contact, digging his foot on the stone tile..
	&ldquo;Iggy IS Boogle now. Kinda. He got impatient and replaced his
	brain with a robot.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Larry
	took another look around. Peach was okay if disarranged, Toadsworth
	and Ludwig.. They were moving, but morbid or &lsquo;off&rsquo; in a
	way he couldn&rsquo;t articulate right then. What overshadowed that
	even was.. Iggy was a cyborg!</font></p>

	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
	lounging toad girl observed traffic from Hotel Mario&rsquo;s tallest
	balcony. Sometimes a citizen would race down Starman Lane on foot,
	like in times past she could faintly remember. Before motor karts
	were the norm in Toad Town, everyone accordingly had less on the
	agenda and time in general felt slower. Toadette wished, just for
	today, she was shot back to those days.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	lowered the magazine after floorboards creaked. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What&rsquo;s

	compared to her. </font>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
	plastered on a smile for the gardener. &ldquo;Just coolin off.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Joseph
	sat gingerly in the beach chair next to her. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in

	waiting for you. We leave in ten minutes. It&rsquo;s at four pm..&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
	I haven&rsquo;t done my hair yet! So many are already at Royal
	Raceway and there&rsquo;s..&rdquo; Dang it. She forgot the sign

	worst time!</font></p>

	conveniently feigned ignorance of her verbalization, taking her hand
	and lifting her out of the seat. Toadette didn&rsquo;t want to
	behave rudely, indecision that roped her to the ground floor
	reception desk. She had to admit it being lit orange from the
	evening sun was an improvement, hiding the dinginess of the carpet
	and making the game machines look cool, but she wasn&rsquo;t happy
	to be there regardless, not with three more co-workers hanging
	around. She dread how they might try to cajole her.</font></p>

	manager only, why haven&rsquo;t I seen it?&rdquo; When she tried to
	take it from him, there was resistance on his end from his trance
	like state that tore it across a preexisting seam middle line. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Ma&rsquo;am
	oh heavens I've ruined it!!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hearing
	Zeror's light voice for once was as surprising as the weathered hand
	written document in an antiquated Shroomish dialect. The official
	mushroom seal adorned the bottom from their castle, Mushroom King
	reign era. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What&rsquo;s
	it say, doll?&rdquo; Les asked enthusiastically. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Well
	Toadette&rsquo;s interest was piqued knowing legalese from collage,
	enough to forget that Zeror should have deciphered the list of items
	and herbs forever ago. &ldquo;What sticks out to me is &rsquo;Teeowed&rsquo;
	and a verb for &lsquo;consume&rsquo; and &lsquo;mushroom&rsquo;...So
	like we left behind this recipe thing and somebody found it for us?
	So what?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Zeror&rsquo;s
	crafty simper to Les and Joe revealed his gold teeth. Toadette
	gulped, rolling up her half of the paper. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
	else of the princess&rsquo;s priceless possessions might we have
	missed?&rdquo; Joe asked.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Uh,
	Joseph, Lester, even Mr. Zeror, there&rsquo;s no way we can recomb
	the area. Not with that event going on,&rdquo; she rebutted. There
	was something very strange and over elaborate with this trap they&rsquo;d
	set, but she wasn&rsquo;t falling for it. They hadn&rsquo;t even
	tried her true weakness-</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Oh
	Tim,&rdquo; Les began. &ldquo;Show her the Chocolate Cake!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The chef
	removed the cover from the pan, a fresh Jelly Ultra. Toadette could
	thankfully refuse, temptation free. She disliked the jelly
	derivatives. Too sticky, much like the situation was getting.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">If
	only that guy would listen!&rdquo; Joe complained to Les and Zeror.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Excuse
	me flower boy,&rdquo; Tim snapped. &ldquo;Face me so I can see what
	you're saying!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	said this, Timothy,&rdquo; after signing the chef&rsquo;s name, Joe
	swung at him. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	rotund chef slipped backward and through the entrance door and
	rolled to a stop at a parking brick outside. He propelled himself up
	as the other three staff barged out brandishing a fire extinguisher,
	a vase, or surprisingly nothing as far as Zeror was concerned. The
	chef exposed from under his apron a long silver butcher's knife and
	held them off with it. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You're
	all on drugs!!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Stoooooop!&rdquo;
	Toadette ran out between him. &ldquo;All this just because I don&rsquo;t
	want to go down there??&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They were
	all daunted, Joe broadly.. &ldquo;You are the foremost of the
	princess&rsquo;s subsidiaries and we cannot attend without you. What
	if officials organize a plan to rescue the princess?&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Not
	likely according to flyers, Toadette mused, in uncharted waters.
	Weird phrasing, Toad Town hadn&rsquo;t had rain in weeks, also- not
	a homicide since fifteen years ago if the baddie influx yesterday
	didn&rsquo;t count, yet Peach&rsquo;s staff were prepared to hurt
	each other. What was happening to people?</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">What
	are you thinking?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	blinked. &ldquo;That&hellip;You are now castle manager. There, now
	you can all attend.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Another
	first, she saw Zeror&rsquo;s bottom lip under his bushy mustache
	while he gaped. &ldquo;How am I qualified, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">You
	were Mr. Toadsworth&rsquo;s friend, has decades of history with the
	Toadstools, and you didn&rsquo;t pack a weapon just now. Done. Oh
	look,&rdquo; she added, under the other three&rsquo;s
	disappointments of the missed promotion. A dark tented van was
	pulling up. &ldquo;Totally just in time.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Guard Jon
	didn&rsquo;t bother with a tally of toads for Peach Castle. It only
	surprised Toadette that he did not bring along his partner. Bridget
	paced at the hotel slot machines, fidgeting constantly with the
	intricacies of her uniform or giggling at her reflections. Toadette
	wasn&rsquo;t sure what drove her desire to formally introduce
	herself. Toadettes were rarer and she was lonely now, and the irony
	wasn&rsquo;t lost on her that after pining for promotion she&rsquo;d
	just demoted herself. There was nothing to lose. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hi.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Bridget
	stood straight on high alert, super scope on hand. She was a tad
	shorter, with entirely different and darker features and sportier, a
	tough one. Maybe this was a bad idea..</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Uh,
	nothing..&rdquo; Toadette bit her lip, backing away.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Wait.
	So you&rsquo;re, haha, good with the city, eh?</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">..Sure.
	I chauffeur the princess sometimes.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	guard&rsquo;s smile widened. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sooo jealous! Since
	that dick Jon is gone will you ride with me on some errands?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Moments
	later Toadette sqeed. Around back was a shiny B-Dasher, a privately
	owned kart used for the job, Mushroom insignias juxtaposed on it,
	and still gorgeous. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Don&rsquo;t
	drool on my seat covers,&rdquo; Bridget joshed, nudging the enamored
	ex-manager.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Toadette blushed. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The guard
	loaded in the back some boxed army supplies that looked suspiciously
	like junk food while Toadette loaded a heavier larger neutral
	colored purse full of many objects and that Ultra Jelly. They drove
	off in the convertible, loving the breeze. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">I
	have a ton of friends stationed around.. Pleasant Path. Know there?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sure
	do!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Doesn&rsquo;t
	a pocketbook like that break your back?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Toadette
	readjusted her seat belt. &ldquo;You get used to it.. Now take that
	right down Turtlely Road,&rdquo; she said to switch the topic. Those
	items were what she thought was the most valuable of Zeror&rsquo;s
	treasure stash, no longer trusting entirely any staff but her
	boyfriend, though even he freaked her out by ominously texting if
	she could bring some of Zoo&rsquo;s evidence from Snifit Patrol
	precinct down South. How did he know that&rsquo;s where she needed
	to get to as well? The cops more pertinently were holding Peach&rsquo;s
	Parcel from yesterday which would surely demystify much of the
	commotion in town..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">For step
	one, Toadette grabbed a well worn cassette from her pocket. This
	other girl was about to love the mushroom rock band &lsquo;The
	Pizza&rsquo;s&rsquo; whether she knew it or not. They&rsquo;d gotten
	heat over it in later years, but none could deny they were the
	masters of subliminal messages.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	wiggled his toes that had fallen asleep in his boots. He was
	genuinely intrigued at the outset. Too bad the pile of books on the
	wooden counter proved to be insipid at best, even with that bright
	warning tag on them stating 'DO NOT REMOVE FROM LIBRARY'. Mario
	dismissed the nagging detail. Considering they were in the local
	librarian's trailer home while they were out on business, The
	Captain must have obtained permission.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Stuck?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Um.
	Yes,&quot; The Captain replied, voice leaking with embarrassment. He
	massaged his strained eyes. On the page characters went backwards
	and forwards at random, and at times 'stylistically' spiraling to
	the center of the page. His attempt to read it was such a
	trainwreck, Luigi felt uncomfortable, left, and never came back.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mario
	without prompt, had a device in his hands. &quot;Break time. Jr.
	Troopa's blowing me up about something at the lab just now.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	Captain bore into the brick-like GoomPCS, a rudimentary model for
	species with no appendages. He'd mistook it for someone else's, but
	the next correct realization was equally worrisome. &quot;You've
	acquired a new cellular phone, and distributed your new number, and
	didn't inform me?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	mildly bewildered plumber slid it back into his pocket. &quot;It
	wasn't that long ago. It's just a cheap thing from the drugstore
	that I used a prepaid card on. Not a big deal okay?-..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;...I'll
	meet you there. Sir.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	moment the plumber was out, he flipped the entire table of books
	with a roar of anguish, making them fly up and into cupboards and
	knickknacks. That beast had been simmering since Luigi left
	practically LAUGHING in his face- now that humiliation in front of
	Mario? The Captain trembled and hyperventilated. If only he could
	cram enough knowledge to interpret the Darklandian in the magikoopa
	book&hellip; The red faded from his vision enough to notice
	something shiny on the floor, retrieving a silver-plated locket. Not
	very valuable he appraised with proficiency, nonetheless someone
	might want to see it.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	waltzed into the previously shut up disarrayed bedroom and opened a
	chest under tangled covers. The bob-omb buddy bound tightly inside
	mumbled through the pillowcase stuffed in his mouth and squirmed at
	the toad's cheeky face as he loomed over. A bad smell struck his
	nose from the fear-stricken victim. Miffed with him, The Captain
	plunked the heirloom down there and shut the trunk tight again. He
	wasn't planning on returning. It would be wise at this point to ask
	his brigade down. He had a way to insure it actually.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	played fetch with Poochy, occasionally waving to neighbors, or being
	forced to rescue them as the Dino Rhino and Ukiki couple that owned
	the berry farm down the jungle path discovered. Poochy was growing
	and inclined to play rough with things or people with certain
	scents. A quirk of the breed, but Yoshi was managing it- more or
	less rather.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	rallied over the dog to escape the elements for a while. Tall sumac
	buffeted him along the way. He'd meant to tame the land around his
	treehouse more. It was covering the 'For sale' sign..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	later collapsed on his striped hammock, watching nostalgically at
	the little leaf spinning fan. He had a dresser to the right, an
	icebox and nothing else that wasn't packed in boxes. The rest of the
	space was racks of trendy clothing and additional boxes. Even before
	plans to emigrate the dino tread light for less complications when
	crossing between Yoshi's Island and the Mushroom Kingdom. At this
	point he could pass as a Mushroomite by accent.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His
	IslandMobile ringing frightened him. He was in the midst of such a..
	delicate situation involving telecommunication.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yoshi.
	Still alive? Luigi wanted to thank you for the help yesterday.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi sat
	up from the hammock, feeling like a thwomp hit him. That deplorable
	work of his in the park against Zoo? Not listening, behaving like a
	rookie.. What did Luigi see in that? Well, he'd make up for it
	double.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Mario,
	you want me over now. Right???&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Uh.
	Better hear what happened since from me than the news.&quot; He told
	him, never interrupted once, which made Mario uneasy.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Great.
	I'll get over there however it takes. Train, boat, plane. -And I
	hate flying but I'll do it!&quot; The dino was already pacing
	around, causing Poochy to drop a plush chew toy and watch.<br/>
&quot;Didn't
	you hear me? You said you were about to get married didn't you?
	Maybe move further inland? Always talking about how your buddies on
	Dino island started families forever ago? With grandchildren now?
	Don't get yourself killed.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He froze.
	&quot;What.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I'm
	giving you at ticket to normalcy Yosh. Hold on.&quot; Mario seemed
	to move somewhere, probably secluded. &quot;I wanted to tell you
	this long ago. Your old lady is sick of you crossing over all the
	time. We both know that.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	dinosaur plopped back down. &quot;Mario I.. Yes, but no matter what
	I do, short of 'nothing', Birdo has an issue. I keep her informed
	every literal hour I'm out. I'm with her if I'm not with you, and of
	course she's not somewhere, where ever that is these days. I'm
	mystified.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No
	you're not.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	sighed, glancing over his home emptily. &quot;Of course. I'm not.
	Either I'll surprise you later, or you can surprise me with how it
	went down in a day or two. Good bye..&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	surprised himself by resisting the urge to move, all the way until
	he heard the squeaks of the ladder outside. Someone was returning to
	the tree home. He stood then and had the door already open for his
	fianc&eacute;e, dolled up in a hot pink dress coat and matching
	church hat. Slightly taken back by his initiative, she blew a kiss
	at him and continued in, placing the Bronze Egg on the mantelpiece.
	Poochy aggressively snarled at it like he always did. Yoshi rolled
	his eyes a little, securing the locks. She was supposed to hide that
	'prop' from 'Authentic Restorations Inc.' knowing it triggered the
	pet like that. Disposing of it wasn't going to fly either, not
	without a fight. His fianc&eacute;e was enraptured with that tacky
	thing, insisting the modeling agencies booked her two-fold with it.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Honey,
	get comfortable please,&rdquo; he led off, remaining standing. He
	watched her casually lounge on her red love sofa without alarm,
	already flicking around on her smartphone. He took one more breath.
	&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about that location you want us to move to.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">She
	snapped in his direction. &ldquo;T. Yoshisaur, half the treehouse is
	in a box!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Indeed,
	but we haven&rsquo;t deposited yet on that Donut Plains condo and I
	would like to, if I can, present my argument differently: Prices are
	up and this land is paid for. If we aren&rsquo;t going to worry
	about money, the Mushroom Kingdom would be a more appropriate fit
	for us. All of your highest paying agencies are based there and I&rsquo;ve
	seen some of the letters where they ask for you to move closer. With
	our rapport we&rsquo;d have zero issues finding a home. Just
	something to consider. Just trying to make you happy.&rdquo; He
	lifted his gaze from his orange booties across the carpet and onto
	her longing expression at...the Bronze Egg!! A flash of anger came
	upon him. He&rsquo;d tried so arduous, for that? He knew what she
	loved and it wasn&rsquo;t him. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	launched it through the window. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">YOSHI!!&rdquo;
	she exploded. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	thought she might follow it, but remained at the window seal. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;-That
	was uncalled for and I'll rectify that.&quot; Yoshi slowly
	approached her side. The sun made three objects glint among the
	ragweed and sumac, including the cracked egg. &quot;However, I have
	no better way to say this.. Birdo, there's a dagger in me and I've
	bled for a long time. Going forward it would be wise for us to take
	a break. Our lifestyles aren't compatible.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Birdo
	slowly faced him. He almost recoiled, not sure what to expect. &quot;I
	agree and- Whew! There's too much chaos in these parts. I really
	wanted to move back to Subcon anyway,&quot; she mentioned about as
	casually as one would the weather.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	thought Mario and crew..dreamed up.. Nevermind. Will you need help?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No.
	I'll hire movers. Old man,&quot; she teased. &quot;And since you've
	ended it officially, I won't be dragged on social media.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Who
	gives unsolicited commentary on other people's romantic life
	online?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	thought you were adept with technology.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Sarcasm
	honey.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
	laughed together, softly rather. Realization of the Abilene paradox
	was bittersweet at best for both of them.</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	rhythmic shuffling of tracks meant there was a slumbering dinosaur
	for a multicolored dog to lick in the face, having escaped from a
	partially sized luggage bag thirty minutes ago. Soon his master
	mumbled about that person again.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Poochy
	was a good boy.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He was
	learning phrases.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	understood 'stop', 'go', 'fetch', and 'Here's money for a shopping
	spree, honey'.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He also
	purported what 'Mario' meant.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That name
	seemed to connect with elation in general for Master.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Therefore&hellip;
	Mario must be food. See? Poochy smart boy.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A loud
	steam whistle jolted Yoshi awake. He flushed at the canine nuzzling
	him. &quot;No boy. Get back in quick. Quick!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Another
	yoshi, the ticket checker that had been pestering everyone in that
	section, and with a katana too, came up. &quot;I knew my allergies
	weren't lying, Larry. Found him.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;The
	Koopaling?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A
	uniformed toad came up. &quot;No sir, I'm the conductor. The Toad
	Town 101 does not allow pets in the passenger compartments,&quot; he
	warned sternly. Then he presented a pen and pad for an autograph.
	&quot;But for the famous Mr. Munchakoopas, we'll pretend we didn't
	see it. We only request that you go to the rear most carriage if
	there's any 'accidents'.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">That was
	a great deal as moments later, Poochy was indicating one of those
	were waiting to happen. That rear unmonitored room was a storage
	area for hay bails, the only source of light the sliding door
	precariously half open. Trees and jungle scrolled by in a jade blur
	outside. As Poochy sniffed around, Yoshi had last minute
	reservations. What if those belonged to someone? He chose to not
	think about it too hard, looking away for the dog's privacy at the
	adjacent wall with an Emerald Circus poster. One of Bowser's sons
	were on the bill. Oh yeah.. He'd seen Lemmy perform by accident
	about a year ago. He bounced around the stage like he had a blast.
	Adorable thing.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;I
	prefer the Cirque du Angry Solei.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His jaw
	dropped at the one next to him. &quot;How did you get here?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Teleportation.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Be
	serious or-&quot; Yoshi grit his teeth. &quot;Just forget it, Dr.
	Professor.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Doctor
	Professor Koopa smiled at him, continuing to hold his shoulder.
	Stubble spotted the corners of his face, but was otherwise just as
	Friday. &quot;I'm not at my practice obviously so you may address me
	Theo.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;How
	about not.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;That's
	really my name.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Look,
	what happened to your havok wreaking crew?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He didn't
	seem particularly concerned. &quot;I suppose apprehended while we
	were fleeing town.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
	are aware we're heading back to Toad Town.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You
	are. I'm not.&quot; Dr. Prof checked his cracked watch and with a
	burst of energy threw himself into another train passing the
	opposite direction. Yoshi made a lightning decision, scooped his dog
	up and did the same. They landed in a pile of red clay. This train
	was rickety and vibrated like an earthquake compared to the last.
	Worse, he feared he was already lost. With no covering over each car
	he could see water on either side and the bridge ahead stretching
	into the unknown. He pressed on. The dino carefully made his way
	over the coupler and into the next car, rewarded with satisfaction
	from that criminal's dumb stare from atop the gravel pile.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Surprise,
	Theodore.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;...You
	have a tenacity most don't at our age, boy! Mario for a certainty
	sent you to hunt me down and stomp my face. I propose an information
	exchange?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The dino
	nodded at the willingness to bargain. He might have also been, just
	a tiny bit, pumped up by that complement. &quot;Fair.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;When
	my 'Sweet Pea' was a grammar school age I was the castle medic. One
	day her father and one of his high ranking red toads, can't remember
	the name but it's unoriginal, flipped out on me over a scientific
	theory that toads and humans favoring is more than a mere
	coincidence.... So I followed where there was a need, at a rapidly
	flourishing Castle Koopa. Great gig until Mushroom Flu broke out.
	You must understand that, while we refer to is as a 'virus' it is
	abstruse, from a mushroom that does not grow on Earth. Yes, those
	bastards sent it as an intentional attack from their evil stars. Dr.
	Mario confirmed it.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	blinked at him. &quot;What are you saying??&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	wrinkles around Dr. Prof. Koopa's eyes creased. &quot;That was my
	end of the bargain. Now please enlighten me on.. the touch of a
	human. -Oh my apologies. You never found out with him.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Him?!
	I.. w-who??&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Mario.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi had
	another bout of.. &quot;That's not how 'that' works. What are you
	trying to leverage against me?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Ah
	ah ah.&quot; The doctor wagged a finger. &quot;If I went there,
	you'd react poorly-&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	found his hands crushing the doctor's throat, demonstrating in real
	time. He shoved the koopa back against the sloped wall of the cart,
	shifting around and half burying both in gravel and powder. It shook
	the dinosaur out of it, stepping back, in fact wanting to be as far
	from the giggling, wheezing fiend as possible.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;The
	cops will deal with you!&quot; He whistled for Poochy and flung
	himself off board and into the blue ocean waters.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A belated
	realization rippled through him that he was in the middle of
	nowhere, the suspension bridge his only aid. He counted concrete
	pillars as some way to track progress. His arms burned by number
	thirty, where a whirlpool began to pulling him. Poochy immediately
	left his saddle and swam away, disappearing over a rolling wave. The
	dinosaur accepted his fate then with equanimity. The canine was only
	preserving his life.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The water
	broke, and he refocused on the fluorescent orange object, a life
	preserver. For him! He encouraged his companion with the ring in his
	teeth until he could grab on. Some rope tethered to it swiftly towed
	them towards a white fishing boat so miniature, the billows obscured
	it easily. The toad reeling them in lauded at the bonus extra soul
	saved.</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No
	problem. That's why I pretend to be a- I mean I AM definitely a
	coast guard. Need another towel?&quot; Sonny, as he introduced
	himself, asked his passengers. He was a youngish red toad wearing
	all black, with a tactical vest as large as him.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;No.
	Thank you again.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Good.
	That was, um, my only one.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Yoshi
	wrapped the dog with it at the moment, being the furry creature of
	the two. Yoshis were resilient anyway and he didn't want Poochy
	getting another sinus infection. Yoshi and the coast guard chat
	readily for a bit, neither prying. Soon Sonny mentioned they were
	near Pipe Land. He reduced speed to not beach on any underground
	pipes, in the process acutely spotting something bobbing around. The
	coast guard released a ragged sigh as he reeled it in. Yoshi soon
	understood. It was a decaying baddie. Sonny had a different
	procedure for that one and it soon was respectfully stored away in a
	large tackle box.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Life was
	too fragile to leave loose ends. Yoshi thought back to the Bronze
	Egg pieces he'd packed with him. It was petty to take that. Best he
	repair or replace, and mail it back to her. Just as a way to say
	maturely, 'sorry it didn't work out, but here'.</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Really?&quot;
	Boo eyed the heavy gift in the black carrying case.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Yeah,
	lil fella. The owner of this kart doesn't deserve cool toys like
	that. Display only now. For safety.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	Koopa was the type to make them comfortable with, well, people.
	Giving them the shiny ray gun found under the seat was a little
	jarring, and Boo had zero experience or want in such, but the
	implications filled them with joy. They were considered grown up,
	capable, cool, trustworthy. Attributes Luigi might like&hellip;
	Further demonstrated when Kylie made a detour for Boo to deliver
	&lsquo;S.G.&rsquo;s other delivery to the Toadley Clinic.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Pulling
	into the lot of Mushroom Kingdom Hospital East, the boo found some
	fringes of their old diffident mood returning. Scattered around were
	karts like the guards drove. Boo braved following Kylie inside. The
	species diverse staff from yesterday were replaced with unfamiliar
	toads either at a desk or seated leisurely in the lobby with reading
	material. While in civilian clothing mostly, their black spots
	hinted otherwise. Boo reached the end of a hallway and noticed Kylie
	was missing. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie,
	finally you show up!!&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Smack in
	the middle of the previous hall, the koopa reporter blanketed the
	toad with a hug. He winced, making her ease up. He was bloated, felt
	quite warm, and was dressed in the same suit he had the last time
	she&rsquo;d seen him, now with dark stains blotting it. His lap was
	filled with old facial tissues stained identically. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mitch,
	what are ya doing here? Does this name ring a bell? Jelectro Bond.
	He called himself your-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sign
	this first babe. I never took you off my power of attorney. It&rsquo;s
	good.&rdquo; Mitch jut a clipboard at her. He never did that, not
	even in the office when he was supposed to hand her things at times.
	Furthermore these sorts of &lsquo;life matters&rsquo; were arranged
	back when they still dated decades ago!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	read over the document in faded hard to read transfer paper ink. He
	could not be presently released due to- Her eyes widened.
	&ldquo;Irregularities in frontal cortex.&rdquo; That explained his
	slurred words, some strabismus.. &ldquo;Mitch. You&rsquo;re busted
	up. What happened to you?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	wheeled away, sluggishly, weakly. &ldquo;Just sign it, hurry.. I
	need to get outta here. Lay down. In my bed. Don&rsquo;t worry. The
	docs don&rsquo;t understand my nose bleed problem is normal-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Mitch-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">For
	the love of God, please sign the thing!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Was
	the second floor colder, or was it just her? The reporter remained
	unnerved proceeding towards Kinopio-Kun&rsquo;s room. She had to
	remind herself, repeatedly, that her co-worker had to deal with his
	own problems. Had he ticked off someone again? Had a hit on him? She
	could only speculate as two piantas in black suits left the room
	before she entered. Weird. She slipped in. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo
	wasn&rsquo;t waiting inside. Uh oh.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The lime
	green toad was up and awake in his bed with a laptop. A table to his
	left held Starmanbucks coffee cups, and a stack of sympathy cards.
	High end personal luggage occupied the guest recliners. Beady eyes
	rose from the bright screen.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-
	Oh Hey. It&rsquo;s Kylie Koopa, ace reporter. I love your work,&quot;
	she fibbed. &quot;Now as ya know there's an event today and-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He waved
	&lsquo;go on&rsquo; impatiently. Kylie&rsquo;s smile tightened.
	Little twerp. &ldquo;-In short. Could ya give the word to the
	&lsquo;authorities&rsquo; that I really wanna be there and won&rsquo;t
	cause any trouble?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">His jaw
	shifted from side to side, thinking it over she guessed. Seemed like
	an inopportune time for other burning questions, such as why he&rsquo;d
	dragged Mario through the wringer this morning with his postings.. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">He
	flashed a symbol, and not the one she expected.</font></p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Deja vu.
	Boo had gotten lost again, finding their way into the cafeteria. The
	air was heavy of various foods and up ahead at the tables staff
	tidied up, discouraging Boo from bothering them. With their head
	down and rosey cheeks, Boo whipped around.</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Where&rsquo;s
	the packet?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo froze
	in the caf&eacute; doorway, quivering at S.G.&rsquo;s voice from
	nowhere. &ldquo;I- I.. delivered it s-sir..&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">There was
	a sound like someone banging their head against a desk. &ldquo;You
	were supposed to deliver the soda can, but get the paper translated
	and returned,&rdquo; he hissed. &ldquo;Ahhhg&hellip;What it
	contained *could* have blown away everyone at the Public Address!!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Noooooo,&rdquo;
	they groveled. &ldquo;I can get it back. I have a helper, and a ride
	and I won&rsquo;t screw up again!&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">They
	zoomed to the lobby, not locating Kylie. Boo went to the help desk,
	in line behind the belligerent, wildly gesticulating X-naut Phd. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">-Because
	computers are untrustworthy paraphernalia compared to this!&rdquo;
	The stout alien in white doctor coat and thick glasses, shook around
	a pink sticky note from his black tattered medical bag. It stated:
	&lsquo;Get out of bed and help us out today at the hospital,
	associate!!!! -Dr. Toad&rsquo;. &ldquo;See? I am supposed to be
	here. Check for the seventeenth time. Morris has two Rs you see,
	like the original spelling of R.O.B before the underground robot
	league visited him and rewrote all the books.&rdquo; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The
	irritated receptionist flipped a &lsquo;temporarily out of service&rsquo;
	sign up and closed the shutter over the glass. Boo was backing away
	when the doctor sniffed the air, impressively through the scarf
	around his lower face. He spun, giddily, &ldquo;You there. Stop. I
	beckon you. You won&rsquo;t regret it.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo
	almost choked on their own spit. Everyone could sense they were
	weirdos anyway, and gave them space outdoors. &ldquo;I promise I'm
	not who you think-&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Cut
	it out. Now, yoink, as the kids say!&quot; He plucked a tiny
	tracking device from behind the boo's invisible ear, further
	exaggerating their stupefied look. &quot;Mr. Charles or Spy Guy is a
	crafty scoundrel for this, recruiting the uninitiated so that I
	cannot snuff him out upon my arrival in town. Until they learn to
	hide the red blinking lights, Super Spy HQ will continue to be one
	of five million secret organizations I know of and will document one
	day with a best seller to shut up those naysayers,&quot; he
	explained importantly, simultaneously revealing an out of date
	atlas. &quot;Oh, and are there any alternative hospitals in the
	area?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Boo
	hesitantly pointed down South.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Splendid.
	Hahaha.&quot; He rubbed his mittens together rapidly.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;..But
	who are you?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Professor
	Morris Cosmo X-naut, Dr. Toad's best scientist. The fellow once told
	me my intelligence scares him.. or was it my resume? Anyway I own
	documents from Dr. Mario, essential for curing MF safely. Did I
	mention we're mad scientists at the Special World Hospital?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Sweat
	rolled off Boo's forehead. Were they doing something wrong all
	along? It all seemed like too much then.. They were </font><em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">split</font></em><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	burst out quicker than the automatic doors could open for her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
	in, woot woot!&ldquo; she cheered. &ldquo;Drop whatever ya doing
	cause we got permission. It&rsquo;s gonna be the biggest thing since
	the Star Festival. And yes if you come, you're gonna be popular!&rdquo;
	she sang. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Booigi
	the Second revolved to face her with a half smile. &quot;I know I
	will.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<hr/>

	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Saul Toad
	verified the order of his cheat cards one last time, then tucked
	them under his cuff. A roar was deafening outside the tent set up,
	emanating from onlookers at the bank. Any closer was prohibited and
	the prayer circles or whatever they were at the castle wreckage site
	were broken up so a PA system could be planted and some order
	restored. The orange capped toad in military uniform, official
	public speaker for the Mushroom King, had only flown down an hour
	ago and with a misbuttoned jacket. He was intent on making up for
	that graceless arrival. He&rsquo;d blow them away. When it was over,
	they&rsquo;d be speechless. Toad Town was only peasants and
	vagrants. Just imagine everyone at the lakefront in their underwear,
	worked every time! </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Heading
	up to the mic stands on the raised area of the lawn with the cannon,
	he was escorted by his choice of guard on each side. The local
	police offered previously, however he relegated those freaks to the
	sidelines. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">&quot;It's
	gonna be good,&rdquo; squeaked the left one. Their name escaped
	Saul, some average height toad of intermediate gender. That's the
	spirit. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">The other
	more imposing one kept silent and hazily secured his right side.
	Saul would have delivered a lashing if not in full view of the crowd
	at that point. That was Benedict&rsquo;s thanks for being pardoned
	and not sent to the gallows?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Saul
	began with the pleasantries and credentials and then rolled right
	into it. &quot;&hellip; Pleased to declare, our King will rebuild
	his daughter's castle in all its splendor and beauty!&quot; He
	allowed applause to reside. &quot;-On a plot of land graciously
	bestowed from his estate in Poshley Heights!&hellip; Questions?&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Intentional
	trick question, rather. Only the handful in the front could shout
	something intelligible, and most of them were &lsquo;citizens&rsquo;
	the Poshley guards planted. Lakitu raised his hand nervously. It was
	&lsquo;the&rsquo; Lakitu, of the Lakitu Bros with a film camera
	running and extensive history with Mario and co&rsquo;s sports. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Hm.
	Interesting. It&rsquo;s just that the princess never expressed that
	desire.&rdquo;</font></p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Perhaps
	not to you. Why wouldn&rsquo;t she want her Castle closer to her
	father and in a &lsquo;safer&rsquo; nicer area?&rdquo; Some
	murmuring arose anew in the crowd, starting at the front and rolling
	back. About as expected. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">A few
	more citizens expressed their views as a boo brought Kylie Koopa to
	the front. The ritzy reporter was nauseous from being phased through
	body after body, but the excitement of the destination helped her
	battle it. She prepared her DSLR. The backdrop was striking. Click
	click click. The jagged ruins of the castle.. Star Hill&rsquo;s
	purple elevations beyond that ..the aristocrats in their midst lined
	up all intimidating like.. Snifit Patrol wagging a finger at her
	from his silver car parked by the tree..</font></p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Kylie
	lowered the camera and waved frivolously. Her eye wandered in the
	process to a semi-visible Boo crossing the prohibited tape. It must
	have been some residual power from before, as she noticed she was
	the only one who could see the boo go uphill and towards- They were
	NOT heading for pesky Snifit Patrol, but Saul in the middle of
	answering something from a Sarasaland roketon diplomat. Kylie
	watched in slow motion the boo solidify, reveal, and aim her gift,
	the ray gun, point blank at the King&rsquo;s representative. </font>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;<font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Open.
	Your. Ears. This is what the millions the back who you refuse to
	hear really think.&rdquo; Booigi fired. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">On
	instinct, the guards pivoted around at the giant, quickly
	evaporating poof of smoke from the barrel and into the freezie in
	between them. Saul was trapped inside, suspended in his wide mouthed
	open palmed pose of terror, and in moving, the dull iron super scope
	both guards held had tapped against the ice. It eerily creaked,
	audible to many with the surreal silence that draped over the
	audience, and crumbled into dozens of pieces containing his diced
	chunks. Some slipped down the hill and against the feet of the
	onlookers and others into the lake where they floated. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, serif">Not the
	way Booigi the Second intended to make it a wash out, but it worked.
