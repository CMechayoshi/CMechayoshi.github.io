<p><strong>Mario and Bowser: Frenemies
Forever</strong></p>
<p><strong>Created: 1/24/16</strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary: The friendly (and not so friendly) rivalry never
ends between Mario and Bowser. How far will they go?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer: I don't own Mario, but if I did, life would be
good !</strong></p>

<p>It was a day at the races. A Mario Kart race took place on the
ever dangerous Rainbow Road. Twelve racers used their driving skills
along with any other trick up their sleeve to win the gold reserved
for only the best of the best.</p>
<p>Among these racers were none other than the great hero, Mario
Mario whose primary rivalry was with the evil lord Bowser Koopa.
While the other ten racers were giving it their all, Mario and Bowser
lead the pack, fighting for first place. It was the final lap so it
all came down to their performance now.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't you even think of passing me, plumber boy. I can and
will hit you with a giant replica of my own shell !&quot; Bowser
shouted to Mario who was driving parallel to him.</p>
<p>He was referring to the Bowser shell item from Double Dash but
this wasn't Double Dash, so immediately Bowser realized how stupid he
had just sounded.</p>
<p>&quot;Silly Bowser, that item isn't even in this game,&quot; Mario
teased stating the obvious. He cut a corner that allowed him to pass
Bowser slightly.</p>
<p>&quot;What are you talking about?! This is not a game, my life is
on the line here!&quot; Someone whined from behind them.</p>
<p>It was Toad with the dreaded thundercloud above him meaning that
he was about to get shrunk and also confirming that this is Mario
Kart Wii apparently.</p>
<p><strong>ZAP!</strong></p>
<p>Toad was shrunk allowing Yoshi to take third.</p>
<p>&quot;Yoshi! Yoshi!&quot; Yoshi cheerfully called.</p>
<p>&quot;Why are these freaks getting as much narration as us?&quot;
Bowser complained.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, I thought this was about OUR rivalry?&quot; Mario
added. He wouldn't exactly consider his friends freaks though, (well,
most of the time) but he did see Bowser's point.</p>
<p>They both snatched item boxes. Mario was in first so statistically
he was probably going to get a lame item like a fake item box. Bowser
was second so statistically he was probably going to get a red shell
because this is MKWii and it hates the person in first place.</p>
<p>To their surprise and/or relief they both got single green shells.</p>
<p>&quot;So it looks like we're even, Koopa!&quot; Mario said while
defensively holding his shell behind him to protect his rear end.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah right, pasta face. Don't you know that I'm the best
green shell bouncer in Dark Land? I'm gonna hurl this shell at that
wall and hit you from the front. You won't see it coming, plumber!&quot;
Bowser bragged, thinking he had just made the best plan ever.</p>
<p>&quot; I won't see it coming? Well, if it's coming from in front
of me, I think I will see it. Even then, you just revealed your whole
plan!&quot; Mario said rolling his eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Ugh! Whatever! He-yah!&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser threw the shell at an wall to the side of Mario. It hit the
wall (one of the few walls on Rainbow Road) and immediately fell off
the track. Mario wasn't scratched.</p>
<p>&quot;Best shell bouncer huh?&quot; Mario teased again. &quot;
Maybe YOU were shell bounced as a baby.&quot; Mario laughed as he
entered the final cannon warp thing on the course. Bowser growled
ferociously as he entered right after them and wished he had the
ability to use his fire breath in the Mario Kart games.</p>
<p>The moment they emerged from the cannon warp thing, they got
lightning zapped by 12th place Donkey Kong. Why? Because people in
last place deserve to be rewarded for it. This made Mario loose his
green shell protection and now he was on equal footing with Bowser.</p>
<p>Bowser caught up with Mario and rammed into him, trying to knock
him off of the edge. The hit didn't shove Mario much, because they
were both tiny. Mario took this rare opportunity of being the same
weight as Bowser and shoved back.</p>
<p>Just then, Yoshi popped up again. He had unshrunk before them and
easily caught up, knocking both Bowser and Mario off the track.</p>
<p>&quot;Noooo!&quot; They both screamed.</p>
<p>&quot;Yoshi! Yoshi!&quot; Yoshi cheerfully called...again.</p>
<p>Before Lakitu could rescue them, everyone else had passed the
finish line, even Donkey Kong.</p>
<p>&quot;Could you take any longer?!&quot; Bowser screamed at Lakitu
while being fished up.</p>
<p>&quot;Look, I work all day using this stupid rod to fish up you
idiots then I have to go home to clean up the house, do my community
service, and take care of my family. I'M DOING THE BEST I CAN!&quot;
Lakitu unexpectantly screamed back.</p>
<p>Bowser was shocked. So shocked that Mario sped off, having been
rescued as well and claimed 11th place. Bowser tried to move but his
car mysteriously stopped working, because that's what happens in
MKWii if you're in 12th place and everyone else has finished.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>Later after the race, the participants were in the Mario Kart
lobby...</p>
<p>&quot;GAAAAHH!&quot; Bowser screamed in frustration.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, I lost too, Bowser. It's not the end of the world,&quot;
Mario reassured him. &quot;But I did do better than you!&quot; Mario
gave him a sly look. Bowser stomped the ground.</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever! I want a rematch, mustache moron!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fine, name the place the time the-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hey guys,&quot; Yoshi interrupted. He could speak English
suddenly and was holding the gold trophy.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I didn't see you. Well, congratulations Yoshi,&quot;
Mario said, giving Yoshi a pat on the back.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, stay out of this! We were clearly trying to schedule
the next time we'll try to kill each other!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bowser, be nice,&quot; Mario said as he tried give Bowser a
pat on his back with his other hand.</p>
<p>They both jerked away from each other (awkward). Bowser's back did
have spikes after all.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't touch me! Listen plumber, I'm gonna call you on the
phone and we will meet again. And you WILL lose! Bwa ha ha ha-
*cough* uh...BYE!&quot; Bowser ran off.</p>
<p>&quot;That's Bowser for ya!&quot; Mario said laughing.</p>
<p>&quot;Yoshi! Yoshi!&quot; Yoshi cheerfully called for the last
time.</p>
<p>His English speaking phase was over. Maybe it never happened.
Maybe Mario should lay off the the shrooms. Maybe Mario should treat
his hand which was now bleeding slightly. Either way, Mario would
look forward to that call because that's what frenemies are for.
Frenemies forever.</p>

<p><strong>Life lessons:</strong></p>
<p><em>Thunderclouds suck.</em></p>
<p><em>You should be rewarded for being 12th place.</em></p>
<p><em>Don't pat Bowser on the back.</em></p>

<p><strong>Author note: This is a story adaptation of an older
hand-drawn comic of mine I wrote primarily in 2008. It was called
&quot;J-Man and the Dragon&quot; referring to Mario and Bowser
obviously. I'm going to try to make this a series of sort, loosely
following my comic. No, the comic isn't posted online anywhere so
you'll have to take my word for it, but hopefully you will enjoy this
series. I based this particular chapter off of Mario Kart Wii, which
is my favorite Mario Kart despite the craziness of it. Feel free to
critique! </strong>

<p><strong>Disclaimer: Mario and co. are owned by Nintendo. You can

<p><strong>Author note: Despite what Bowser complained about with
extra characters and what not, this is exactly what this chapter was
about. Specifically Luigi. I cutdown on some of the snark the first
chapter had. I hoping this will sound a bit more neutral without the
unreliable narrator</strong>.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>It was a normal early morning at the Mario residence. Luigi just
couldn't sleep so he sat up on his bed reading a book. Since this was
the most quiet time of day for the Mario bros, why not? Well
almost...</p>
<p>Mario was sound asleep and snoring. Luigi rummaged through some
drawers on his side of the room. He found what he was looking for, a
sleeping mask that they had bought some time ago. He slipped it
around Mario's head to control snoring problem.</p>
<p>&quot;Now why did Mario stop using this thing?&quot; Luigi asked
himself.</p>
<p>Just then, Mario's Cellular Shopper loudly vibrated on the drawer.</p>
<p>&quot;A phone call at this time of morning?&quot; He caught a
glimpse of the caller id-</p>
<p>&quot;K-king Koopa?!&quot; he shrieked loudly.</p>
<p>Mario stirred a bit at the noise. Luigi rushed to his bed and
shook him violently.</p>
<p>&quot;M-mario! It's Koopa!&quot; Luigi screamed.</p>
<p>&quot;Huh? Uh- Wow!&quot; Mario jumped up.</p>
<p>&quot;We must be under attack!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I sure am Luigi... Can't you see they've put a 'Koopa Kanine
Klamp' on my face?!&quot; Mario shouted in a muffled voice, sounding
disgruntled and drowsy at the same time.</p>
<p>&quot;A what? No, your phone- Bowser is calling your number!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh never mind the phone, now help me with this Koopa Kanine
Klamp!&quot; Mario said while wrestling with the sleep mask. It was
only then that Luigi remembered why Mario stopped using it. He would
attack it every time he woke up while half asleep.</p>
<p>Mario freed himself from the &quot;Klamp&quot;, throwing it on the
ground like it was a dangerous object. Immediately the phone stopped
vibrating and chimed-</p>
<p><em>'You have one new voice mail'</em></p>
<p>&quot;This is it bro. It might be a threat, a ransom, a declare of
war-&quot; Luigi was shaking as he stood above the phone.</p>
<p>&quot;Nah, It's probably nothing. Now, what's up with this Koopa
Kanine Klamp?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mario, it's your sleep mask! We need to listen to the
message-&quot;</p>
<p>The voice mail started:</p>
<p>'<em>Hey pal. Uh, I was up because of Ludwig's all night concert
and I was just thinking. What was that recipe for that Couple's Cake?
You know, that cake that only friends eat together? That cake that we
ate together that other day? *unintelligible mumbling* No, I'm not
calling Mario! *more mumbling* Shut up Kamek, you're not my real dad!
*mumbling* Talk to ya later, plumber!-'</em></p>
<p>'<em>End of message'</em></p>
<p>The voice mail stopped. Mario was now fully awake sat on the bed
worried. Luigi was dumbstruck.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, that Bowser. He wouldn't be able to use a cookbook if
his life depended on it-&quot; Mario nervously chuckled.</p>
<p>Luigi gave him a concerned look.</p>
<p>&quot;-Anyway, I wonder why Bowser had this thing labeled
&quot;Medi-mask Sleep Apparatus.&quot; he added, trying to change the
subject.</p>
<p>&quot;M-mario, did he call you p-pal?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh that, uh&hellip;maybe you just heard it wrong,&quot; he
quickly answered.</p>
<p>Mario picked up the phone and appeared to be sending a text. He
put it down and cut it off.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh look at the time! We can still get some nice rest bro,
good night!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But..&quot;</p>
<p>Mario jumped back in bed and threw the covers over his head.
Immediately after snoring noises was heard, although they sounded a
bit fake.</p>
<p>&quot;What the heck just happened?&quot; Luigi questioned himself.</p>
<p>He picked up the sleeping mask and wisely decided against putting
it back on Mario. It would stay in the drawer, indefinitely.</p>
<p>&quot;That Bowser thinks he's pals with my bro? No, that can't be
right. Bowser is just being the trickster that he is...Hmm, and with
that text, Mario must have told him screw off. Yeah! Uh, maybe&hellip;Well
Mario has a tennis game tomorrow. I better let him sleep.&quot; Luigi
reasoned to himself.</p>
<p>Not entirely satisfied, Luigi went back to bed. He still couldn't
sleep, but for a different reason this time&hellip;.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>&quot;Well what are ya trying to say?&quot; Toad asked while
twitching.</p>
<p>Luigi was hanging around Toad, who was running a concession stand
in front of the Castle's courtyard. A tennis match was scheduled
today and Peach allowed citizens to run their own businesses at the
entrance with her permission.</p>
<p>&quot;They are pals. PALS. I know what I heard last night. &quot;
Luigi said while shaking Toad.</p>
<p>&quot;And tennis partners...did you see the schedule?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now please put me down, unless you want to be covered in my
signature Shroom Shakes!&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi quickly complied.</p>
<p>&quot;So are you gonna be at the tennis match or not?&quot; Toad
asked.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess so and, wait aren't you participating?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you actually want to go against Bowser? And my brother?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because...never mind. Toad, you've been a bit different
since that Mario Kart race.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yup. Being zapped ten-thousand volts and surviving teaches
you to enjoy life a little. Treasure the good and bad. Follow your
own path in life.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's..strangely deep, Toad&hellip;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm just kidding! I now have this twitching problem and my
heart is beating fast and and I think all this will give me an edge
in the game!&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi rolled his eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, see you later Toad..&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, but don't you want to try a Shroom Shake?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know how they taste already.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But you don't know how mine taste,&quot; Toad teased.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay fine.&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi put a coin in the tip jar. Toad immediately got to work
making the fresh Shroom Shake. He poured the ingredients in glass
bowl and then hand spun it. His arm moved as fast as lightning. He
stopped after five seconds and poured the well blended contents in a
cup, not even out of breath.</p>
<p>&quot;D-did the Thunder cloud give you that too?&quot; Luigi said
baffled.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, I guess so. Hey look!&quot;</p>
<p>Approaching the courtyard entrance was Mario. Toad greeted by
waving his hand, at an extreme speed like before. Mario gave a
confused look and waved back. He then turned his attention to Luigi.</p>
<p>&quot;Bro. I see you're out and about early.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure.&quot; Luigi responded. He took a sip of the shake and
shivered. It was ice cold, but actually good.</p>
<p>&quot;What? Worried about that phone call, last night?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, but I see you will be with Bowser for the doubles&hellip;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it's not like you're playing, or Peach, or anyone else
I usually partner with.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There's Daisy..&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; Toad chimed in, &quot; Im Daisy's partner! AND WE
WILL DOMINATE AND DESTROY. CRUSH AND COMMAND. FRUSTRATE AND...well,
have fun of course. That's what it's all about, right guys?&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi hesitated to take another sip. On the other hand, should he
drink something Toad has made?</p>
<p>&quot;Yoshi Yoshi!&quot; Yoshi came out of nowhere and cheerfully
called, because he's in this chapter now.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey Yoshi!&quot; Mario greeted.</p>
<p>&quot;What up, my homeboy!&quot; Toad announced through a
megaphone for no reason.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, hey Yoshi...&quot; Luigi muttered. The megaphone was
right next to his ear.</p>
<p>&quot;How are you guys? I'm in the tennis tournament with Shy
Guy.&quot; Yoshi said.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm with uh..Bowser&quot; Mario said discreetly, now aware
of Luigi's suspicion.</p>
<p>&quot;Team 'Daioad' for the win!&quot; Toad screamed through the
megaphone.</p>
<p>&quot;Toad, don't say it like that. It sounds like you're shipping
yourselves together,&quot; Luigi fumed, &quot;and give me that
megaphone!&quot; He snatched it from Toad.</p>
<p>&quot;You're just jealous cause Daisy doesn't love you-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shut up-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Besides, I need the megaphone for this-&quot;</p>
<p>Toad snatched it back and yelled, &quot;ALL SHROOM SHAKES HALF OFF
NOWGETTHEMWHILETHEYAREFRESHBECUZWHILEIMSMOKINGITWITHDAISYSHOPWILLBECLOSED...thank
you!&quot;</p>
<p>A large line appeared in front of his stand. Toad's shakes where
indeed popular. Making enough shakes for the crowd was no hassle with
Toads new tornado arms. Mario and Yoshi snuck away for good reason.
They were some of the first players on court for the match. Luigi
stood amidst the chaos in a stupor.</p>
<p>He still had no idea what the heck was going on.</p>

<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>Mario was in the mens locker room, his doubles match was about to
start in a few minutes.</p>
<p>He took out his signiture 'M' tennis racket and examined it. His
fireball power shots had taken a toll on it. It was seared and black
looking as opposed to the blue color it originally was.</p>
<p>&quot;Raaaawwrr!&quot; Bowser anounced, coming from the bathroom.</p>
<p>&quot;Bowser, quit.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever, 'Man in Red'.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You talking to me? Is that a new insult?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well yeah, you're the only loser in here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wasn't sure, Koopa. That sounded too nice coming from you.
You going soft on me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Plumber, the only thing that's soft is your crappy tennis
racket. Its literally toast.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>Mario looked back at the racket. It was pactically crumbling in
his hand.</p>
<p>&quot;HELLO HOMEBOYS. LET'S HAVE A GREAT GAME!&quot; Toad screamed
into that megaphone again. He was standing that the door.</p>
<p>&quot;Shut the heck up! Your voice has been annoying enough since
the Gamecube days and I'll be darned if I have to hear it through a
megaphone!&quot; Bowser screamed back.</p>
<p>Mario found himself mentally agreeing again. Bowser was mean, but
he sometimes had a point.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't you remember that I had to have throat surgery after
screaming so much in Mario Kart 64? You are going down for insulting
my medical issues, Koopa scum!- Oh hey Mario.&quot; Toad ranted and
then greeted cheerfully in that exact order.</p>
<p>&quot;Uhg, didn't we have enough issues with these extra
characters?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Listen Toad. Me and Bowser need to 'talk', could you leave
us?&quot; Mario carefully said while nodding his head to the exit.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, okay Mario,&quot; Toad calmly replied. Then he picked up
the megaphone, &quot;Screw you, Bowser!&quot;</p>
<p>He ran out of the door laughing. Bowser growled loudly while
holding his ears. Mario accidentally dropped his racket in surprise
at Toads random megaphone useage combined with the growling from
Bowser.</p>
<p>*<strong>Crack</strong>*</p>
<p>The brittle and battle worn racket broke in half. Now Mario was in
trouble. That racket had lasted every Mario Tennis game untill now.</p>
<p>&quot;OH NO!&quot; Mario dropped to the floor trying to pick up
the pieces.</p>
<p>&quot;Well what did you expect, plumber? That thing was more burnt
than that time Kamek tried to grill steak- usng the castle's lava!&quot;</p>
<p>Mario could help but to giggle a bit at the thought of that.
Bowser had a wierd way of lightening up the mood, even if it was
usually unintentional.</p>
<p>&quot;What are you giggling about, mustache? We are screwed. Well,
unless you can handle one of my spares&hellip;.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Would you really do that for me, Bowser?&quot; Mario said
getting up.</p>
<p>&quot;Look, you can't be my partner without a racket and I'd hate
to lose because you're too cheap to replace your gear so-&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser dramatically punched a locker, making the door fall off.</p>
<p>&quot;Was that nessessary?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. Now take this,&quot; Bowser said, reaching into the
battered locker. He pulled out a racket that looked very simular to
his own. It was green with a Bowser emblem in the middle.</p>
<p>&quot;It's old, plumber. Be careful with it!&quot; He motioned it
towards Mario. Mario took it, only to be caught off guard by the
weight. It considerably heavier than his usual racket.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, thanks. I guess I can get used to this..&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, you'd better. We're up!&quot; Bowser said, looking at
the clock on the wall, &quot; I may be sleep deprived because of last
night but I can see that!&quot;</p>
<p>Mario looked worried, Bowser had unknowingly reminded him of
something.</p>
<p>&quot;What? You don't like my undeserved generosity?&quot; Bowser
laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh no... It's just that last night, I thought I was being
attacked by one of your 'Koopa Kanine Klamps', but that's besides the
point- I had to lie to Luigi because of your phone call!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh? Oh you mean 'Green'? So?&quot;</p>
<p>Mario gave him the side eye. Bowser pouted.</p>
<p>&quot;Look, let's win this game and then you can apologize to him.
Okay? I really don't want to lose against Toad...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What about Daisy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh her? Listen, don't tell anyone I said this but... She can
win over me anytime,&quot; Bowser winked. Mario suddenly felt
disgusted.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's get out of here...&quot;</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>Mario and Bowser exited the locker rooms and entered the court
area just as Lakitu started to announce the game. This was just a
recreational match between Mario and friends so there wasn't a big
crowd. Mario tried to spot Luigi from the bleachers but couldn't.
What little audience there was was raving and ranting like it was the
Super Mushroom Bowl. Lakitu was sitting in the umpire chair and
spotted the duo. With everyone here, it was game time.</p>
<p>&quot;Ladies and gentlemen...and Bowser!&quot; Lakitu and Bowser
exchanged nasty looks. That fact that Lakitu spoke through a
megaphone ticked off Bowser extra</p>
<p>&quot;Our first doubles, Mario and Bowser vs Princess Dasiy and
Toad!&quot;</p>
<p>As Lakitu announced that, Toad and Daisy entered the court. Daisy
was dressed in her sports outfit while Toad was wearing a red bandana
on his head. He was also twitching and foaming at the mouth. They got
into position on court and Mario and Bowser did the same.</p>
<p>&quot;The winner will face off against Yoshi and Shy Guy! First
serve, Mario.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, Toad? You alright?&quot; Mario asked. Toad definitely
wasn't looking good. He seemed even more crazed than before. In fact,
a Daisy didn't look so good either. He noticed her eyes were
bloodshot and-</p>
<p>*<strong>Thwak</strong>*</p>
<p>The ball hit Mario in the face and laughter could be heard from
the crowd. The excellent aim could only be attributed to Lakitu.</p>
<p>&quot;I said- first serve Mario!&quot; Lakitu clarified with a
scowl. The 'enemy of my enemy is my friend' motto didn't apply here.
Lakitu hated Mario and Bowser equally.</p>
<p>&quot;Mario, didn't you hear? Pick it up and serve!&quot; Bowser
commanded.</p>
<p>Mario groaned but obeyed. The quicker the game was over, the
sooner he could set things straight with Luigi. For now, it was show
time.</p>

<p>Luigi got himself together and finally entered the stadium. He
realized he was late as he caught a glimpse of Mario getting hit by a
ball. I hope this turns out alright for my brother, working with the
enemy and all, he thought. He found a seat next to an unfortunately
familiar face.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello there, he he he!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hello Boo. Uh, nice to see you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nice to seeee yooou!&quot; Boo sang.</p>
<p>Luigi signed and observed the game. He saw Toad and Daisy looking
rather unhinged, and an impatient Bowser. He then saw Mario
recovering and getting ready to serve.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>Mario took a deep breath and swung. He shot towards Toad who
immediately hit it back. Bowser intercepted at the net and attempted
to lob it over Daisy's head. It seemed to work but then Daisy did a
backflip made contact with the ball. It flew in between Mario and
Bowser leaving a fiery trail.</p>
<p>&quot;0-15!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;H-how!?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know either, plumber boy. Let's just win.&quot;</p>
<p>Mario served again but with a topspin towards Toad. Toad curved
the ball around Bowser at the net. Mario saw a clear shot and
attempted a flatshot but the added weight of Bowser's racket threw
him off and he sliced the ball. It landed right in front of Daisy who
deliver a nasty topspin shot down the line. Bowser did a mad dash and
made contact. The ball flew towards them...</p>
<p>&quot;Out! 0-30&quot;</p>
<p>..and out of bounds.</p>
<p>&quot;Way to go Bowser...&quot; Mario groaned.</p>
<p>&quot;Excuse me 'Mr. I can't do an easy flatshot'!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm new to your racket!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mustache, you just aren't used to real sports equipment!&quot;</p>
<p>As Bowser argued and Lakitu got someone to recover the ball. Mario
wondered how Daisy and Toad were doing on the other side of the
court. They were awfully quiet and rather well coordinated. Under
usual circumstances the two could barely tolerate each other.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay we have the ball. Let the game continue-&quot; Lakitu
scowled, &quot;-Or else!&quot;</p>
<p>After a few more rounds they managed to tie with Mario/Bowser
having advantage. Mario served lighter than usual, wisely
compensating for girth of Bowser's racket. The oserve went as planned
this time. Daisy went for a simple shot and Bowser hugged the net.
She made the mistake of serving directly to Bowser and he thanked her
by sending a power shot her way. She managed to hit it back but force
shoved her to the back. Bowser did a drop shot her way and not even
her weird backflip thing could save it.</p>
<p>&quot;Mario and Bowser win!&quot; Lakitu announced begrudgingly.</p>
<p>&quot;Great job!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, for me. You barely did anything, Mario. I hope we
don't suffer when I have to serve and YOU have to take the net!&quot;</p>
<p>Mario felt unsure. Bowser was carrying the team right now. He'd
need to get completely comfortable with Bowser's racket and soon.</p>
<p>&quot;Change!&quot;</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>Luigi had to admit he was mildly impressed. Mario and Bowser
weren't as awful together as he would have though. Mario even seemed
to be doing okay with that strange Bowser racket he was using. Then
he heard Lakitu call for them to change sides. Suddenly he saw Daisy
mumbling as she toppled over. Toad started shaking, more like
vibrating. He could heard hear him shrieking, &quot;H-h-e-e-a-a-p-p?&quot;
Boy, Toad is shaking so much, I'm wondering if he's going to lift off
to the moon, he thought.</p>
<p>&quot;Umm, time out I guess. And get a medic!&quot; Lakitu called.</p>
<p>Toad? Daisy? What is going on?! Luigi questioned himself. He got
up. He had to check this out. Unfortunately the crowd was just as
shaken by this and Luigi suddenly started to regret not being nearer
to an exit. He was getting nowhere fast.</p>
<p>He saw Mario rushing to their aid as medical staff entered the
court. Bowser rushed over too. Then one of the more animated crowd
goers who happened to be a Whomp blocked Luigi's view.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh- hey! Sir?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah..its noooo good. He he!&quot; The boo next to him
laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, these are my friends involved here. Well except for
Bowser but-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But whhhhhyy would you worry when it's all going according
to plan?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>
<p>The boo blushed.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess I'm saying too much, he he!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Excuse me? Do you know something here?&quot;</p>
<p>The boo looked away and Luigi got more agitated. It goes without
saying that Luigi doesn't get along with these types. He felt
helpless.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>Some of the medics were examining the fallen Daisy. Others were
trying restrain Toad. Within seconds, Toad was tazed and he fell
over, joining Daisy in an unconscious state. Toad's megaphone fell
out of his pocket and broke.</p>
<p>Bowser chucked. &quot;Serves you right. Well, I mean it would if
this wasn't a potentially life threatening situation...&quot;</p>
<p>Mario gave Bowser a particularly nasty look.</p>
<p>&quot;This is serious, Bowser. No games.&quot; Mario said sternly.
Bowser found himself obeying for some reason.</p>
<p>&quot;Give us space people! She's in shock!&quot; one medic
called.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh what is happening-will they be okay?&quot; Mario asked in
a panic.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot say at the moment. They will need to be rushed to
the Mushroom emergency room, pronto,&quot; one medic answered. Just
then sirens could be heard.</p>
<p>&quot;All, right show's over...&quot; Lakitu announced bored.</p>
<p>&quot;This cannot be happening...&quot; Mario muttered as he
watched medics cart Toad and Daisy away to ambulances.</p>
<p>&quot;So. Does this mean we win?&quot; Bowser asked and
immediately regretted.</p>
<p>Mario turned to him with fiery eyes. Before Mario could seriously
hurt Bowser, someone ran on the court screaming an horrible cry that
could be easily heard over the crowd and commotion.</p>
<p>&quot;NOooooOoOOOOooo!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, Shyguy. Don't throw your life away over this. It's just
a game!&quot; Yoshi pleaded as he followed him on court.</p>
<p>&quot;No no no no no no no. This was my last chance. I can never
play again!&quot; Shyguy ran to the net and cried profusely.</p>
<p>&quot;Please, there will be other times!&quot; Yoshi called as he
ran to him. Everyone else on field either awkwardly stared or
ignored. The crowd was too busy ripping themselves apart to notice.</p>
<p>&quot;No, they simply don't play tennis where I'm going!&quot; Shy
guy dramatically pulled out a soda and a pack of Mentos.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ohmygoodness I love those!&quot; Lakitu shouted. He ran from
the umpire chair to Shyguy in matter of seconds and snatched the
items away. In a frenzied state, he combined the soda and Mentos in
his mouth, the resulting foam spraying everywhere.</p>
<p>&quot;Umm. What just happened?&quot; Yoshi asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah. You mean doing that won't make you explode or
something?&quot; Shyguy asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Shyguy, of course not. Why would you...oh my-&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser and Mario stepped up.</p>
<p>&quot;What was this all about?&quot; Bowser complained. &quot;I
didn't know this was a drama story!&quot;</p>
<p>Mario jabbed him in the ribs in an unplayful way and glared.
Bowser shot back the same look.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you guys okay?&quot; Mario asked with mixed emotions.</p>
<p>&quot;No! I'm moving to Australia right after the game. This was
my last change to play tennis because the sport is illegal there! I
know it's true, I read in on the Internet!&quot; Shyguy got on his
knees and tears started to fall again.</p>
<p>&quot;Shyguy...&quot; Bowser uncharacteristically paused to choose
his words carefully. &quot;That's not true- at all pal. It's a big
sport there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Mario joined in, &quot;You must have gotten lied
to online. Or umm...what's the word?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You mean trolled.&quot; Yoshi said.</p>
<p>&quot;Garden trolls lied to me. Got it!&quot; Shyguy said now with
a look of determination.</p>
<p>&quot;No, it's garden gnomes,&quot; Mario corrected.</p>
<p>&quot;Gnomes lied to me on the Internet?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No- Never mind. Have a safe trip, Shyguy,&quot; Mario knew
it was best to drop that topic.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay now this is just strange instead of dramatic...&quot;
Bowser shrugged.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey- the game is over. Leave!&quot; Lakitu interrupted.</p>
<p>Lakitu was covered in soda foam, making him look more rabid than
usual. The gang took one look at him and made the right choice.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>Luigi felt like he was being tortured amongst the wild crowd,
unable to move or see what was going on.</p>
<p>&quot;Cheer up! He he,&quot; Boo smiled.</p>
<p>Luigi shot back a ghastly look and kept silent.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay fine...I will admit it...I love you,&quot; Boo said
simply.</p>
<p>&quot;What?!&quot; Luigi gasped.</p>
<p>&quot;Just kidding. He he. It's a set up. A conspiracy. Who would
want Mario and Bowser together? What's next? Cats and dogs living
together? Mass hysteria!&quot; Boo laughed playfully.</p>
<p>&quot;Boo. Be straight with me!&quot; Luigi warned. Boo blushed
again.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, weegee. The plot was to ruin the game. Got the info
from trusted sources!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Soooo, Bowser did this?&quot; Luigi asked. Boo was strange
and joked around alot, but Luigi had no reason to assume this was a
lie.</p>
<p>Boo shrugged. &quot;I don't know. I just know what I know. Hehe.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well I know that this scheme has Koopa written all over it!&quot;
Luigi suddenly shouted. &quot;I HAVE to get out of here! Could..you
help me I'm some way?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, why didn't you say so?&quot;</p>
<p>Boo suddenly grabbed Luigi's arm. Before Luigi could react, the
was a blinding flash!</p>
<p><strong>Poof</strong>!</p>
<p>Next thing he knew, he was in the parking lot outside with Boo
holding on to him.</p>
<p>&quot;Wha- of course. Teleporting... You can let me go now, Boo.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Umm, of course! Hehe!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm going to the hospital uh, thanks...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You don't want any help?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not saying I dislike you on principle or anything but, I
want to be alone...&quot; Luigi said more coldly than he meant.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh...&quot; Boo sulked and slowly walked (floated?) away.</p>
<p>&quot;I mean wait!&quot; Luigi called back, &quot;I'm being rude.
I don't handle stressful situations that well and- I didn't mean to
come off like that!&quot;</p>
<p>Boo turned around. Luigi continued.</p>
<p>&quot;You did just reveal what was going and and save me from the
crowd,&quot; Luigi smiled.</p>
<p>&quot;Soooo, we can be the 'Scare Pair' again?&quot; Boo asked.</p>
<p>Luigi was impressed with the fact that Boo remembered Mario Party
6. &quot;Sure, uh. Partner. One thing. I left my phone at home. Could
you text Mario for me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Annnyyyy thing for you!&quot;</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>As Mario, Bowser, and Yoshi left the stadium-</p>
<p>&quot;I have so much to worry about right now. First, I need to
head to the hospital,&quot; Mario said.</p>
<p>&quot;Me too,&quot; Yoshi said. &quot;I don't even know what's
happening, but if something was tough enough to knock Daisy out, It's
serious business.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah..come to think of it-&quot; Mario turned sharply to
Bowser. &quot;You wouldn't have anything to do with this, would you?&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser was taken back. &quot;Me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, Bowser would have reason to rig your match,&quot; Yoshi
half whispered in Mario's ear.</p>
<p>&quot;I heard that. And I did not! What makes me the first
suspect?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're evil?&quot; Mario answered annoyed.</p>
<p>&quot;Well yeah but...Toad weirds me out and Daisy? You know I
don't mess with her! I prefer Mushroom Kingdom Princesses, you know!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So he's xenophobic too!&quot; Yoshi whispered again.</p>
<p>&quot;I can hear you, dinosaur breath! I win my matches fair and
square! Look, Mario do you believe me or not?&quot;</p>
<p>Mario scratched his head. Bowser did seem surprised at the
strangeness of Toad and Daisy. Also he knew (or hoped) that Bowser
would know better than to truly hurt his friends. Still, he couldn't
seem too friendly with Bowser. Yoshi was present and much like Luigi,
Mario hadn't really shared the extent of their relationship with him.
Like usual it was time for Mario to play peacekeeper.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't say for sure if I know anything so let's just drop
it for now and see what the doctors say. Also, Bowser are you coming
with me- I mean-&quot; Mario immediately regretted that.</p>
<p>&quot;Mario, this is BOWSER. Why would you want him to come?&quot;
Yoshi asked suspiciously.</p>
<p>Before Mario could answer, his phone made a text message sound.
Saved by technology he thought, as he checked it. It was from an
unknown number?</p>
<p>Message: <em>Hello bro, dis is Luigi. I'm heading 2 the hospital.
I need to talk 2 u there. Btw, I think Bowser has something 2 do w/
dis! Watch out! See u there.</em></p>
<p>Mario looked up from the phone and then to Bowser and then to
Yoshi. They both looked to Mario expectantly. A choice had to be
made.</p>

<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>Luigi and Boo entered the hospital, Luigi shaken and anxious and
Boo passive.</p>
<p>&quot;I haven't been in a hospital since forever!&quot; Boo
blurted out.</p>
<p>Luigi thought about a Boo wouldn't need a hospital unless...well
his mind didn't want to go there. Not with his friends in critical
condition.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's just find their rooms,&quot; Luigi half-yelled over
the confusion in the lobby.</p>
<p>The waiting room was more of a chaos room, Mushroom Kingdom
citizens of all types were standing around in a mild panic. Nurses
and doctors repeatedly crossed past the lobby to either wing of the
hospital, all in a hurry and often carrying supplies and/or wheel
chaired patients. Luigi felt in his gut that something was wrong.</p>
<p>&quot;They sure are busy today!&quot; Boo yelled back as the
reached the front desk. The nurse Toad inside looked back at them in
horror.</p>
<p>&quot;What's going on miss?&quot; Luigi asked.</p>
<p>The nurse screamed and retreated somewhere behind. As if that
scream was a wake up call, some of the people waiting in the lobby
screamed. Then other people screamed because those people were
screaming. Several Bob-ombs lit themselves up. Koopas retreated in
shells. Monty moles attempted to burrow through the ground, which
didn't turn out well with the concrete floor. Whomps and Thwomps fell
to the floor, further damaging the concrete. Shyguys and Toads
well...they don't have special abilities so they just screamed
normally, but at least they didn't damage the concrete!</p>
<p>After everyone was done freaking out for no reason, it randomly
got silent. Everyone stopped and stared at each other in confusion,
except for the nurses and doctors who continued to busily scurry
about.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh uh I forgot to mention, Luigi,&quot; Boo mumbled
embarrassingly, &quot;People are usually scared of Boos in hospitals.
It's in bad taste or something? I'm so sorry!&quot; Boo turned to
Luigi and gave him the &quot;forgive me please&quot; eyes.</p>
<p>Luigi blushed. &quot;Aww, how could I not forgive a face like- er
uh, wait what?&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi didn't know what was going on but...well, it was more
pleasant this time.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>&quot;WHO DO YOU WANT, ME OR BOWSER!?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yoshi, what are you doing?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry, Mario. I'm on the phone,&quot; Yoshi whispered while
holding his hand to the phone speaker. &quot;And I was just reciting
what happened before to Birdo.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But that's not how it happened-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;-And so Mario was like, 'Yoshi, you are the best' and you
see Birdo, this is why you gotta love Mario...&quot;</p>
<p>Mario tuned out the rest of Yoshi's revealing conversation and
stared out of the bus window. They were on a route speeding towards
the hospital and fast. Mario had made a tough decision but he had no
choice...maybe. It was for the greater good and he couldn't send the
wrong idea to Yoshi. Besides, Bowser was used to doing things on his
own anyway, right?</p>
<p>Or at least Mario wished he could reason that way. He pulled out
his phone and stared at the contacts list. He had a few contacts of
past enemies that would made the Princess shrug in polite
disagreement, but only one would make her question his heroic
integrity.</p>
<p>Mario texted Bowser.</p>
<p>&quot;*<em>nervous emoji</em>*&quot;</p>
<p>A moment later. &quot;<em>What, plumber?</em>&quot;</p>
<p><em>&quot;U mad?&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I'm busy.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;*sad face emoji*&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Enough mustache, speak English to me!&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Bowser, I'm so sorry. I just want to to know that-&quot;</em></p>
<p>The bus skid to a halt right before Mario finished typing. Not
that he knew what to say anyway. Yoshi jumped in excitement.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, this bus has hit a new record on the amount of potholes
hit. Remember last time we kissed right as we went over that
construction zone?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Excuse me?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shh, Mario! I'm on the phone, remember? Okay, I gotta go
Birdo, my friends are in danger and Bowser's definitely behind it
all. Bye!&quot;</p>
<p>Mario was scowling until he heard that last part. Suddenly he knew
how to end that text. He quickly sent the message while exiting the
bus.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Bowser, I'm so sorry. I just want to to know that- I
know you didn't do this. Meet me at the hospital please!</em>&quot;</p>
<p>Mario waited. No immediate response. He walked to the hospital
entrance and Yoshi followed with a more serious demeanor than before.
Yoshi was playful and kind natured, but deathly serious about the
well being of friends. Mario would have to forget about Bowser for
now and focus on other issues, he recalled a text from Luigi saying
he would he would be-</p>
<p>&quot;Bro! You're here!&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi greeted him from the lobby area. Mario noticed a lot of
people standing around confusingly and the hospital staff hurrying
along and ignoring everything but their jobs. Also, the concrete
floor was in rough shape. Weird.</p>
<p>&quot;Luigi? What's going on?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, we had some hiccups when we got here but it's okay now.
A nurse will lead us to Toad and Daisy soon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, who else is here?&quot; Yoshi asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Well...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hehehehe,&quot; someone crackled.</p>
<p>&quot;What the-?&quot; Mario and Yoshi started.</p>
<p>&quot;Guys, calm down. It's Boo, but invisible. That's how I sent
you that text, remember?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ok well, why? Don't you know what happens when Boos visit
hospitals?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, bro. I sure figured that out,&quot; Luigi rolled his
eyes. &quot;Anyway, Boo helped me get here quick from the tennis
match. I didn't have enough on me for the the Mushroom bus anyway.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thats what we took though,&quot; Yoshi said. &quot;Did you
know he hit more potholes than the previous record?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yaaaay!&quot; Boo cheered, making Mario and Yoshi jump
again. &quot;Oh yeah I'm invisable. Sorry?&quot;</p>
<p>Just then, a nurse approached. &quot;Okay, you can visit the two.
Follow me,&quot; she stated matter of factly and without looking up
from her clipboard. Mario and the rest complied silently. Then Mario
felt a buzz, his phone. He checked it expectantly.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>It's about time you got some sense in ya, plumber. I'll
meet you on the roof in an hour. Be ready. *evil emoji*&quot;</em></p>
<p>Mario smiled, feeling suddenly better, but then he worried. How
would he pull this off with Yoshi AND his brother around? And what
would be the case with Daisy and Toad?</p>
<p>To be continued...</p>
