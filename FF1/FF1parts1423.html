Forever</strong></p>
<p><strong>Night of the restless Mario characters (Chapter 14)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Created: 4/5/17 -4/9 (edited 4/10)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer: Mario and co. Belong to
NIIIIINNNNTTTEEENNNDDOOO (Woohoo!)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Author note: Can events ever stop happening all in one
day? Well they will after this chapter. The original draft was
written in one day, then over the next couple of days I rewrote it to
fit in tone wise. The rest was editing and etc. etc. you get the
point. ^_^</strong></p>

<p>The streets of Toad Town were quiet. Shops were closed and the
town's residence slept peacefully at home. Those however that knew
what's up, tended to flock to one place, Club 64. A nice and friendly
little restaurant/cafe in the day, nightclub and bar at night.</p>
<p>Jelectro Bond's silver Aston Mushroom pulled up. Kylie Koopa's
face was practically glued to the window, she could hardly contain
her excitement. As Bond pulled into the crowded parking space Kylie
even recognized a few license plates of past trouble makers she'd had
encounters with on the job. 'STINGYA', a B Dasher kart that belonged
to a venomous Pokey she'd exposed for conspiracy. 'NOTAGME88', a
Barrel Train that belonged to a mentally unstable Shy Guy who was
convinced his life was a video game. 'DAISYRLZH8RZ', a Power Flower
kart that belonged to a con-artist Princess Daisy impersonator.
Lastly, 'BOWZAFAN', a oversized Koopa King kart that seemed strangely
familiar? Strangely though, no Mercedes-Benzes were in sight.</p>
<p>&quot;Is everything okay?&quot; Bond asked, cutting off the
ignition.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh it's nothing. Just wonderin'...if you ever worry about
getting dents in this fancy thing!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do not worry. This is safe, despite the occasional seedy
customer.&quot; Bond replied, as if he had read her mind.</p>
<p>Kylie was mildly weirded out, but forgot about it when she saw the
giant billboard. &quot;Free dranks? Woohoo! Shame I'm not dressed for
the special occasion!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are stunning as you are, mon ami. Take my hand.&quot;</p>
<p>Kylie flushed. She never thought she'd meet a true gentleman in a
two in a half foot Noki! As they walked from the parking lot hand in
hand, booming bass could be heard through the walls. The neon lights,
including a now vintage Nintendo 64 sign, were displayed in the glass
window. Despite the uncharacteristically rowdy aura that surrounded
the club at this hour, this was still the relatively safe Toad Town,
so they went inside with no harassment from bouncers or security.</p>
<p>Suddenly an unmarked white van screeched to a stop straight in
front of the door.</p>
<p>&quot;Think they'll let us park here?&quot; Jimmy M. asked. The
rest of the MKDCU agents groaned.</p>
<p>&quot;You imbecile, haven't you learned anything? We just got
towed for this today!&quot; Dick snapped.</p>
<p>&quot;Just get out, Richard. Wiggs, you too!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Whata 'bout us?&quot; Parabilly asked.</p>
<p>&quot;You and Sebastian get to stay and watch Toad and Daisy! We
gots to get them at the Toadley Clinic in another hour, or we will
loose our commission. By the way, they are awfully quiet now...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Patients have went into a unconscious state. Do we exit the
vehicle now?&quot; Wiggs asked.</p>
<p>Jimmy suddenly leaned to the side to look at something in the
mirror. &quot;Are...are thems flashing blue lights back there? Uh
oh!&quot;</p>
<p>Dick and Wiggletron jumped out immediately at the suggestion. The
van sped towards the parking lot right as a Mushroom Police car
passed by. The Toad officer inside narrowed his eyes and followed the
van into the parking lot anyway.</p>
<p>&quot;Gotta love Jimmy, eh?&quot; Dick said sarcastically.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p><strong>Meanwhile at Peach's Castle</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Oh Mario! I'm so glad you're here,&quot; Princess Peach
exclaimed the moment Mario entered the room. Toadette had came in
with him, holding his hand.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll uh...leave you guys alone now,&quot; Toadette said
ackwardly. She slowly backed up and closed the door.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm so sorry Princess,&quot; Mario apologized, looking
towards the ground.</p>
<p>&quot;It's Peach, remember? But anyway, what happened?&quot; Peach
asked impatiently.</p>
<p>&quot;Daisy and Toad are still in the 'care' or should I say,
clutches of the MKD-whatever..&quot; Peach gasped and instinctively
clutched her hands together. Mario told her about the crazy events
that happened at the hospital which kelp her on the edge of her seat.</p>
<p>&quot;This is terrible! But Mario, that part isn't your fault!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know, but everything else is...I'm sorry that I've been so
wrapped up trying to be Bowser's friend that I've pushed you all
away. I'm sorry that I've came up with plans without you guys. I'm
sorry that I've broken my promises. And I'm sorry to...Luigi!&quot;
Mario suddenly remembered. &quot;Princess, I mean Peach, I have to
get home.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fine Mario. But...at least tell me something first.&quot;
Peach got from her seat up to approach Mario. &quot;Is it real?&quot;</p>
<p>Mario scratched his head. &quot;Is what real?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You and Bowser?&quot;</p>
<p>Mario continued to look confused. &quot;Umm. Yes? Why, Prin-
Peach?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know. Just...are you sure Bowser can be trusted?&quot;</p>
<p>Mario was silent for a moment. &quot;Yes. I believe so. Wait, I
know so! Bowser isn't the nicest guy in the world, but he knows to
not cross the line. Bowser has never tried to hurt us outside of our
games has he?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, I guess so. Listen Mario, I believe and trust you, but
you can't expect everyone else to. If this information spreads...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know, I know. People will always judge others, but you
can't please everyone either. The only thing you can really worry
about is making things right with your friends and family. I'll talk
to you tomorrow, Princess. Good night.&quot; Mario turned away.</p>
<p>&quot;It's Peach!&quot; Peach called out, &quot;And one more
thing!&quot; Mario turned around. &quot;Where do you think those
agent people are taking Daisy and Toad?&quot;</p>
<p>Mario thought hard. &quot;Hmm...I'd check out the Toadley Clinic
tomorrow for a start. Hopefully though, we can plan something out
tomorrow. Together, I mean!&quot;</p>
<p>Peach smiled until she thought of something. &quot;Yes, it would
be nice to have some team work for once, but what about Bowser?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh about that...We can always meet outside somewhere to not
scare anyone. Either way, we'll think of something. I won't even
bother to call him tonight. He has enough worries with the kind of
people that live at his castle!&quot; Mario and Peach laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay Mario, so long,&quot; Peach said, giving Mario a hug.</p>
<p>&quot;So long...Peach.&quot;</p>
<p>As Mario left, Peach felt a lot better about the whole situation.
Yes, despite the dire circumstances she knew Mario could accomplish
anything with the help of others. Still there were matters to attend
to. Peach rung for Toadsworth.</p>

<p><strong>Club 64</strong></p>
<p>The Dance music was loud, dancers danced (or stumbled around) on
the dance floor, and the more subdued customers sat at the tables,
eating and drinking.</p>
<p>Emery sat that the bar, sipping her Strange Fruits juice. Only
cheesy Super Mario Bros Super Show cartoons were shown on the TV
screens so she found herself quite bored. After work, she had sped to
there in her prized (and unpopular among her peers) Koopa King kart
for some fun but 'fun' was in short supply tonight. There wasn't even
a local garage band playing! Then, across the room, she spotted
someone she could swear she'd seen before. A sunglasses wearing Noki?
Also, was that her friend Kylie Koopa? She watched them seat
themselves towards the back and order something.</p>
<p>Feeling brave and curious, Emery got up to set down in an empty
bench directly behind them, carefully escaping their notice. Since
when did Kylie have a boyfriend? They were definitely into each
other, holding hands and what not! Wasn't she married to the job,
like she insisted when Emery had tried to hook her up with a cute
Doctor she knew? No matter, Emery would finally get to snoop on the
master snooper!</p>
<p>Dick and Wiggletron entered the club and went straight for the
bar.</p>
<p>&quot;Hmm. Wonder what they serve at night like this? I've never
been the clubbing type!&quot; Dick yelled over the music.</p>
<p>&quot;I just want a cup of ice,&quot; Wiggletron said wearily.</p>
<p>&quot;You alright?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Headache. I did not want James to know of my condition.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why not?! He's not really really our boss.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Correct. We must however communicate respectfully with him
regardless.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well aren't you an sweet angel? I'll call the fool out any
time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Wiggs said mischievously, &quot;And look at the
situation that will befall you now!&quot;</p>
<p>Dick looked back in annoyance and confusion. &quot;Wiggs, what is
with you? Seriously!&quot;</p>
<p>Wiggs laughed. &quot;I am kidding! I will be honest with you. You
are my friend, correct?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh...sure...You ARE the only person in the world I don't
hate right now..&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you wonder why James tolerates your unpleasant attitude?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because he'd better?&quot; Dick huffed.</p>
<p>&quot;Because he plans to fire you when when we drop off our
patients. He will do so before our pay as a final 'screw you' so to
speak. He explained this to us all before we picked you up for the
mission.&quot; As Wiggs explained this typical monotone, Dick was
fuming.</p>
<p>&quot;WHAT?!&quot; He screamed, louder than the dance music.
Everyone nearby stared at the Mega Goomba and Wiggler like they were
freaks.</p>
<p>&quot;It was the plan all along, Richard. He wanted to work with
you no longer. He hates you actually, as does the rest. Please calm
down.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That dirty rat! I knew he was taking my insults a little too
well. He just couldn't wait to get rid of me! And the rest agreed? I
knew they were idiots but...hey! Did YOU agree?&quot;</p>
<p>Wiggs chuckled slightly. &quot;Of course not! I was waiting for a
moment to disclose this information to you, actually. You know I have
affection for you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, okay. Good... Wait what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What would you two like tonight?&quot; the morbidly polite
bartender, who had been listening to the whole thing, asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Beverages are free, correct? Ice water only,&quot; Wiggs
said.</p>
<p>&quot;The strongest thing you got!&quot; Dick ordered. &quot;I'm
as good and fired and I needed this money! Why did we ever let Jimmy
handle the commissions? What am I gonna do?&quot;</p>
<p>The bartender sat down the water and some Root Beer. Dick chugged
his as Wiggs looked on amusingly.</p>
<p>&quot;I can assist you,&quot; Wiggs said. &quot;I knew the Morse
code from the BooTracker you suddenly acquired. Your secret is safe
with me. By the way, James is here. Hello James!&quot;</p>
<p>Root beer spewed out of Dick's mouth as Jimmy M. walked up to the
agents in his usual pompous way.</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry for the wait. Would you believe the coppers gave me a
ticket anyway? I swear the cops in the Mushroom Kingdom are more
tight wound than a... What's Richard's problem?&quot;</p>
<p>Dick breathed deeply, as if holding himself back from doing
something. &quot;I quit,&quot; he said simply.</p>
<p>Jimmy gasped. &quot;What? Why?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because...I found a better agency! Yeah!&quot;</p>
<p>Jimmy gave him strange look. &quot;Better than the MKDCU?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh huh. Why do we call ourselves that? None of us are even
from the Mushroom Kingdom.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will report you failure of protocol to boss, and he won't
be happy bout this!&quot; Jimmy said sternly.</p>
<p>&quot;Tell him then. And tell him about your failure of protocol
#143,656,343! Don't backstab fellow agents!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You were gonna fire me anyway!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I told him.&quot; Wiggletron admitted.</p>
<p>Jimmy crossed his arms. &quot;Both of you twos are fired then!
Yeah, who's boss now?&quot;</p>
<p>Wiggletron sat continently, as if he expected this. Dick got up
from his seat and approached Jimmy, towering over him. &quot;You'll
never be the boss of anything, you coward. You care more about
following arbitrary protocols then getting work done. Do you even
know what's going on right under your furry little nose?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Back off you! You think that I?..Ugh, whatever! You twos
planned this didn't you? Enjoy your unemployment together!&quot;
Jimmy turned around. &quot;MKDCU, out!&quot; He announced to himself
as he scurried out of the door.</p>
<p>&quot;HAHAHA, wait...Did he just say that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It appears so. So unfortunate. I could have really expended
that five dollars.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;FIVE DOLLARS? I must have misheard five hundred. I've earned
more money scrubbing pipes during the summer. What a waste!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who is your agency now?&quot; Wiggs suddenly asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Hm. Well I guess it's now this Bond pipsqueak and annoying
reporter girl. In fact, I think I see them in the back. You should
join me and we can maybe get some money out of them for helping them
out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So you would like my assistance!&quot; Wiggs said grinning
ear to ear. (Use your imagination.)</p>
<p>&quot;Well what else were you going to do? We're all struggling in
the big level called 'life' together, right? Besides, you ARE my only
friend. Pals?&quot;</p>
<p>Wiggs responded by unexpectedly patting him on the back. This
knocked to the breath out of Dick slightly.</p>
<p>&quot;I apologize for underestimating my strength. What
information do they possess?&quot;</p>
<p>Dick quickly explained Bond and Kylie's hypothesis to Wiggs. He
sat up with a serious face. &quot;Let us not let more time elapse
uselessly.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>At the Mario bros. House</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Got you!&quot; Luigi said excitingly to Boo. His character
(which was himself) did their victory animation.</p>
<p>&quot;Only because you wave dashed!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Boo, this isn't Melee. Besides, what I kept doing was a
'tech'.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You just said a random smash bros term, didn't you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ummmm, maybe? Whatever. I'll get you next time, hehe.&quot;
Boo and Luigi were on the floor playing Smash Bros 4 for the WiiU.
Mario entered, surprised at the house. Candy wrappers and soda cans
were on the floor and games were strolled everywhere.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello Luigi..and Boo?&quot; Mario greeted.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey bro!&quot; Luigi got up and gave him a hug. &quot;Sorry
I got carried away this late at night. Wow! 1 a.m already?&quot; The
younger brother looked around embarrassingly.</p>
<p>&quot;Er, it's okay Luigi. You seem happy tonight!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because he's beat me every time in Smash Bros,&quot; Boo
said. &quot;I'm edge guarding next time!&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi pretended to be annoyed. &quot;Yeah but you'll need to learn
to 'punish' first!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not if I spam you from afar, hehe. Well I better go. As much
as I love nighttime, I know it's important for you humans to sleep,&quot;
Boo said, heading for the door.</p>
<p>Luigi yawned. &quot;Yeah I guess so..Talk to you later, Boo. You
can call me on my own cell phone by the way.&quot; Luigi winked and
Boo did so back. Mario was confused at this, but let it go. This
wasn't the atmosphere he thought he'd come home to, so he wasn't
going to complain. Still, he had to get something off of his chest.</p>
<p>&quot;Boo is such a 'casual', right?&quot; Luigi jest, turning to
Mario. &quot;Hey, I still had a blast during that one hundred stock
match!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Actually bro, I have to apologize again. I-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know. You got so wrapped up in trying to be a fair and
good friend to Bowser that you forgot about us for a moment. You
promise to keep your promises from now on and not be a 'tuna head' so
much.&quot; Luigi said matter of factly.</p>
<p>&quot;Umm...Yeah. That's exactly what I was going to say! Wait,
you guys think I'm a 'tuna head'?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sometimes you are, but it's okay bro. We're just plumbers
from Brooklyn, not angels! It was about time Mr. Perfect screwed up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who's that?&quot; Mario asked.</p>
<p>&quot;You?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh? Me?...&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi looked at him funny until he realized that this was actually
new news to Mario. &quot;Of course they do! You aren't just the hero,
you are their savior, local celebrity, leader...well you get the
point.&quot;</p>
<p>Mario sighed. &quot;Oh yeah, that...You know, I love to help
everyone, but that can come with a lot of pressure too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;One level at a time, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right, I guess.. So I bet you're wondering what went down.
Well-&quot; Mario then explained the day's earlier events to him.
Luigi went pale at the mention of Toad and Daisy's attack. &quot;And
so you see, I'll never let something like this happen again. We will
all meet up tomorrow and discuss how we should do things together.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Discuss what? Isn't this out of our hands, now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe not. It's whatever you think we should do. I elect you
leader now!&quot; Mario explained warmly.</p>
<p>&quot;Me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. I am a tuna head I suppose. You're just as passionate
about our friends and you have patience and delicacy that this
situation needs. You've been on adventures before and you know the
deal. My biggest mistake was to think that we needed brawn to handle
this but look at where we are now! I know you can do this, bro. I
believe in you.&quot; Mario put his hand on Luigi's shoulder.</p>
<p>&quot;But...what will everyone?-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They will accept you as the leader for now, I'll make sure
of it. Now we'd better settle down if we want to be any good for
tomorrow. This mess can be cleaned later.&quot; Mario went into the
washroom as Luigi stood speechless.</p>
<p>He was prepared to forgive Mario and be content with that but not
for Mario to elect him leader of their little mission. Where to
start? Would this mean that Mario would take orders from him now?
What about Bowser and the rest? Luigi didn't know what was happening,
but he was eager to find out how this would turn out.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p><strong>At Peach's Castle</strong></p>
<p>After leaving Mario and the Princess, Toadette got ready to head
home. Since this was school season, she was staying on campus at
Mushroom College instead of the castle. There was just one thing, she
hadn't seen Buckenberry since her arrival! She checked his post
inside the castle but he wasn't there. She asked other staff but they
hadn't seen him either. She knew something was wrong, Buckenberry
only disappeared like this when he was in one of his &quot;moods&quot;.
Of course by disappear, she meant he went to set on the lake shore to
brood. Sure enough, she spotted him outside staring into his
reflection in the water.</p>
<p>&quot;There you are! What's up?&quot; Toadette greeted.</p>
<p>Buckenberry jumped. &quot;Toadette?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Um, who else? Anyway, why the long face? Sad cause there
hasn't been a New Super Mario Bros game in forever? Get over it!&quot;
she teased.</p>
<p>Buckenberry continued to look in the water. &quot;Do you know
something?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; Toadette sat beside him.</p>
<p>&quot;It's about Toad Toadstool.&quot;</p>
<p>Toadette shifted uncomfortably. When she and Toad went out,
Buckenberry rarely if ever interacted with them. After their breakup
though, Buckenberry randomly asked Toadette out and she said yes for
the fun of it.</p>
<p>They hit it off to her surprise. He was less bombastic for
starters and Toadette appreciated being with someone who wasn't a
celebrity. She also liked how Buckenberry was kind of mysterious. He
showed up out of nowhere as castle employee, and then immediately
volunteered to help the Mario bros. on a dangerous mission. He was
brave, educated, and hardworking, but he had one problem...</p>
<p>&quot;What about him? He's in horrible shape! Haven't you heard
about them being taken by some special agents?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know that!&quot; Buckenberry snapped. Toadette frowned.</p>
<p>&quot;Well excuse ME! I sort of care when people I know and love
are sick!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do some of those people talk to Larry Koopa on Facebook?!&quot;</p>
<p>Toadette's stomach turned as Peach's revelation about Mario and
Bowser came to mind. &quot;Umm. He does?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes! I can't believe it. I told Mr. Toadsworth and he didn't
want to do anything about it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, what do you want him to do?&quot;</p>
<p>Buckenberry stood up. &quot;Throw the rotten fungus out of the
castle! He talks to Koopalings!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And what exactly is wrong about that, huh?!&quot; she asked
pointedly.</p>
<p>&quot;What's wrong with that? Bowser and his associates are our
enemies! Do I need to explain this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe so, but they might not be that bad in real life.
There's forces out there more evil than Bowser, you know!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you defending him?!&quot; By now their voices raised to
the point of attracting curious looks from the night gardeners.</p>
<p>&quot;Lots of people may converse with the Koopa Troop
occasionally. It doesn't mean it's wrong or evil. Heck, even your
idol Mario talks to Bowser!&quot; Toadette immediately covered her
mouth. Buckenberry's eyes went wide in shock. &quot;Listen, you can't
tell anyone I said that! Everyone will freak-they won't understand!
Please!&quot;</p>
<p>Her boyfriend then did something unexpected. He broke down and
started to cry! Buckenberry, affectionately nicknamed &quot;Cool
Blue&quot; by Mario for his stoic and cold demeanor, cried
hysterically.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm...so sorry...&quot; he sobbed, &quot;I just get so
jealous sometimes! I can't help it. No matter what I do, it's never
good enough!&quot;</p>
<p>Toadette put her arm around him. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Toad gets the credit for everything! I did my very best,
risking my life in a way hardly any Toad ever has and I get nothing!
Why can't I be the hero for once?&quot;</p>
<p>Toadette shook her head. &quot;What does it matter? Toad works
very hard here. Haven't you seen how things are running with him
gone? No one is organized, dust is piling up, and everyone in
despair. Would you really be selfish enough to want him gone, because
YOU don't like his friends?&quot;</p>
<p>Buckenberry stood silently as he wiped away his tears. Toadette
took a deep breath, &quot;You know what? I talk to a Bowser minion
too! Wendy O. Koopa and I share beauty tips on Instagram sometimes.
It's no big deal, we don't talk much but still. I guess that makes me
a hypocrite for judging Mario at first. I was just sure Bowser must
have some evil motives behind it, but the Princess seemed to really
believe in Mario. We both know that the Princess has the purest heart
in all of the kingdom, so if she can believe in their friendship, I
do to! Think about it- We both love the Princess, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I would risk anything for the Princess! Why would you ask me
that?&quot; Buckenberry asked pointedly.</p>
<p>&quot;Because we need to band together instead of tearing each
other apart. It's not about getting a statue made or New-Mushroom
Peace Prize, it's doing what's right. THAT'S how you can do a real
service...&quot;</p>
<p>They stood for a moment. Toadette looked towards the lake and
Buckenberry sniffled some more.</p>
<p>&quot;Well I'm going to the dorms,&quot; Toadette spoke up. &quot;You
take care of yourself, okay?&quot; Toadette started to walk away.</p>
<p>&quot;I won't tell,&quot; he said quietly.</p>
<p>She turned around. &quot;Well...good. I guess...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I really am sorry. Everything you just said was right. I
just...feel so useless sometimes..&quot;</p>
<p>Toadette gasped. &quot;Why? Like you've said before, you've done
so much more than most Toads. You have tons of accomplishments to be
proud of. You just can't let jealousy turn you so ugly!...Besides, I
love you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I love you too.&quot; They hugged. The castle gardeners
rolled their eyes. Typical youngster romance!</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p><strong>Club 64</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Wow oh wow! This place is smoking!&quot; Kylie exclaimed.
Bond smiled in response. She took another bite of her Koopasta. Since
they were in the back, the music was less loud and the place more
subdued in general. They talked and ate, though Bond was unusually
quiet. But in a hot way! Dick and Wiggletron approached the table to
Kylie's surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;Richard! I was wondering when you'd join us,&quot; Bond
greeted cordially, &quot;And I see Agent Wiggletron Berry of Yoshi's
Island is accompanying you. I'm so glad you both knew Morse code.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Greetings to you, Jelectro Bond,&quot; Wiggs said. His voice
was flat as ever but he smiled genuinely enough to make Kylie feel at
ease with the tall stranger.</p>
<p>Dick didn't bother with a greeting. &quot;We ain't stupid, you
know. Now don't give me trouble, I just got fired. Wiggs too!&quot;</p>
<p>Bond's eyebrow raised. &quot;Hm? That is unfortunate! Sit, will
you? And tell us what is new.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure shorty!&quot; Dick sat next to Bond, accidentally
squishing him against the wall, and then recited the earlier events
involving Toad and Daisy, but he forgot to mention that Mario and
Bowser were there. Kylie pushed her plate aside and wrote the details
in her notebook, somehow keeping up with Dick's mildly incoherent and
rambly recount.</p>
<p>&quot;What IS the MKDCU exactly, brother? How'd you get into this
bucket of Cheep Cheeps?&quot; Kylie asked, too excited to notice that
Bond had disappeared.</p>
<p>&quot;I can answer your inquiry,&quot; Wiggs said. &quot;The MKDCU
are independent heath experts that band together in times of crisis
for a fee. They work according to strict protocols set by the
employer. Someone from MK hospital called us in, but I am uncertain
as to who. James may have that information but he has left our
vicinity.&quot;</p>
<p>Kylie studiously recorded this info in her notebook too, then her
pen died. &quot;Dang, my special glittery pen!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Take this,&quot; Bond said, handing her a silver expensive
looking fountain pen.</p>
<p>&quot;Where were you just now?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Being suffocated to death. I knew Richard might try to kill
me one day, but I didn't think it would be unintentionally.&quot;
Bond said casually.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay?&quot; Dick said, not really following the
conversation.</p>
<p>&quot;Who is James anyway?&quot; Bond asked amusingly, &quot;I
feel like I should know him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;James is Jimmy M., the lazy Monty Mole. He was kind of our
leader, but really he's just the son of the actual boss. Ya know,
dirty sneaks from Donut Plains. What does the have to do with
stopping Bowser anyway?! Hey, where is Bond now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Over here. Where were they taking Mario's friends?&quot;
Bond had crawled under the table to Kylie and Wiggletron's side and
sat in between the two. Kylie had never been this close to Bond
before and was distracted by his cologne. Wow, it smelled expensive!</p>
<p>&quot;It's Demented by Dimentio,&quot; Wiggs whispered to her.
Kylie game him a weird look.</p>
<p>&quot;How do you keep disappearing? Anyway, the Toadley Clinic,&quot;
Dick answered. &quot;Then once there was a diagnosis, some special
hospital in Special World. Why?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh this is not good...&quot; Bond murmured.</p>
<p>On the row behind them, Emery couldn't believe what she'd heard.
Toadley Clinic? She'd volunteered there before and the place was cray
cray. They only dealt with the worse of the worse. Secondly, if
Mario's friends were going there, they might get sent off to they
maximum severity hospital in Special World. Legend says, patients
never leave! She have to do something now! She peeked over the bench
seat.</p>
<p>&quot;Emery?&quot; Kylie called out. &quot;Guys, this is my buddy.
She works at the hospital and she's a crafty one too!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm disappointed in my self,&quot; Bond admitted, &quot;You
were snooping in on us and I only noticed now. Someone's wonderful
smile must have distracted me!&quot; Kylie flushed after he said
this. Wiggletron too!</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; Wiggs said.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, I meant...never mind. You are Emery Toadstool of MK
East, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes! And I can- I mean...What were y'all talking about?&quot;
Emery had been listening at first, but after a moment she had gotten
bored spent most of the time playing on her phone. The Toadley Clinic
being mentioned was what had caught her attention again.</p>
<p>&quot;Emery, do you want to do your country a service?&quot; Bond
asked with sudden seriousness.</p>
<p>Emery shrugged. &quot;Sure?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Country? Isn't this about Mario?&quot; Dick asked.</p>
<p>Bond dodged the question. &quot;If what I think is about to happen
happens, we might have big trouble mes amies...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not gettin it, Bond. What do you know that we don't?&quot;
Kylie asked with some annoyance. Bond motioned for everyone to get
up. He lead them to the back stage kind of area where bands would
play. At this time it was empty, save a giant fish tank filled with
exotic and colorful Cheep Cheeps.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything is confidential from this point onward,
understood?&quot;</p>
<p>Everyone nodded. Wiggs raised his hand. &quot;Does this mean you
consider me to be an assistant in your operation?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course?&quot; Bond replied curiously.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you! It means so much to be accepted by a wonderful
Noki such as yourself!&quot; Wiggs affectionately patted Bond on the
back, which sent the Noki flying into the fish tank. Water splashed
on the floor and Dick laughed hysterically as Wiggs and Kylie
frantically ran to his aid. Emery only rolled her eyes
unimpressively. This was the least weird thing that had happened all
day. No one in the club seemed to notice the commotion either.</p>
<p>Once he was (fished) out, he immediately continued, &quot;These
are the facts: Toad and Daisy's coma walking proves that is is
Mushroom Flu; we know this had to have originated from Bowser,
specifically his castle laboratory; we know they would have had to
have been deliberately targeted; we know that all other cases of the
T-virus are less severe for an unknown reason; we know Bowser, or
someone in his household would have a motive; we do not know how this
was introduced. And worse still, all of the has occurred in one day.
Questions?&quot;</p>
<p>Everyone was silent as if taking his statements in. Or maybe cause
Bond was soaking wet, his sunglasses were crooked, and he and acted
as if he wasn't just smacked like Daisy smacked Bowser in Mario Party
3. Wiggs raised his hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Umm, yes?&quot; Bond asked hesitantly.</p>
<p>&quot;You stated that Bowser or someone in his household would
have a motive to hurt Mario's friends, correct? If so why was he
working with- Do you require assistance?&quot;</p>
<p>Bond seem to be a a brief trancelike state. Then he immediately
regained his composure and felt his glasses, as if making sure they
were tightly on his face.</p>
<p>&quot;Excellent...question!&quot; Bond blurted out. Everyone was
too weirded out to interrupt. &quot;You did ask something, right?
Well anyway, these are my secondary points: It is clear that the
MKDCU coming was part of the plan. I would not at all imply that the
MKDCU themselves are in on it, but it is obvious now that they were
meant to interfere somehow. Because of the complications that arose
from that, Toad and Daisy are now ultimately inaccessible and are in
danger of being permanently that way. How does the crazed Koopa
Doctor and Nurse Nass T. come into play? Surely they didn't call-&quot;</p>
<p>Emery jumped. &quot;Nass T.? My mom?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yeah! She is your mom. I forget that,&quot; Kylie said.
&quot;Are you saying she's involved, Bond?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. And I say that without a doubt. That is why I ask
again, are you willing to fully cooperate?&quot; Bond looked
expectantly to Emery.</p>
<p>Emery thought for a moment. Her mom didn't have the best
reputation and their family was in debt. If some kind of reward was
involved in all of this, she would have to admit that her mom getting
involved in the conspiracy was exactly what she'd do.</p>
<p>As if Bond could read her mind, he added, &quot;Listen mon ami, I
also know for certain that she isn't at the head of this. I just want
you to find out about all of the circumstances of the victims
tomorrow at work. You don't have to turn anyone in or mention
anything to anyone else. Here.&quot; He handed her a soaking wet
BooTracker. &quot;It's water proof, don't worry. Just let me know
what you find, okay?&quot;</p>
<p>Emery slowly nodded. She could do that at least, right? And now
all of this serious business was making her tired. Emery swept back
her black hair. &quot;I'm gonna go, guys,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;Very well. Au revoir!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stay safe,&quot; Kylie said, feeling uneasy about the whole
situation again. Wiggs waved. After she left Bond signaled their
attention.</p>
<p>&quot;As for the rest of us, we will put our infiltration plan on
hold.&quot; Bond said, spacing out again. Something had occurred in
his mind. Something that he'd been suppressing from the moment they
entered the club. Now however what he saw was real, or it seemed to
be. Mass chaos. Confusion. Hopelessness. Betrayal. War.</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; Dick said, snapping Bond out of it.</p>
<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why put the plan we were so sure about on hold?&quot; Kylie
asked, noticing Bond's sudden stiltedness.</p>
<p>&quot;Because...When the official word of Mushroom Flu gets out
tomorrow morning, all Underwhere will break loose. And...I just can't
say what our next move should be..&quot; At least not without another
vision, he added in his head.</p>
<p>&quot;We oughta warn somebody, right? Like Mario?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He will find out. I know this for certain.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How are you so certain of the future, Mr.
wears-sunglasses-at-night?&quot; Dick accused, stepping up to him.
&quot;This is the Mushroom Kingdom and everything has eyes for Pete's
sake! Anything can happen! If we're gonna work with you, you better
fill us in on your plan, buddy!&quot;</p>
<p>Instead of a response, Bond suddenly slipped past them and threw
some coins on their table for a tip. Then he turned back towards them
as if he suddenly remembered where he was. &quot;Umm, so long
gentlemen, we have to go. Now that is. We will talk more tomorrow.
Let's get you home, Kylie.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh?&quot; Kylie gave him a confused look but followed. She
grabbed his still soaking wet arm and they marched straight for the
door.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah you'd better scram! I mean wait...That's not what I
wanted! What IS this guy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sauve. Mysterious. A perpetual sunglasses wearer. Handsome?&quot;
Wiggs answered. Dick looked at him funny.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay...How dare they bail on us? We don't have a ride or a
place to sleep tonight! We didn't even discuss our fee!&quot;</p>
<p>Wiggs looked to him and smiled. &quot;Regardless I am extremely
glad to be part of his operation. I even forgot about my headache! As
for a place to reside, I have provisions for that!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And what exactly do you mean by that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My friend, T. Yoshisaur Muchakoopa lives near here. I am
surprised he did not recognize me earlier.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You mean Yoshi? I know what you and that Bond guy have in
common. Y'all are too dang formal!&quot;</p>
<p>Wiggs laughed loudly though no one was joking. &quot;Affirmative,
friend!&quot; Wiggs wrapped his arm around Dick's back, but
thankfully no one flew anywhere this time.</p>
<p><strong>Later</strong></p>
<p>&quot;What was that about, Bond?&quot; Kylie finally asked as Bond
pulled up to her apartment. She lived in a meager complex off of
Pleasant Path. Since this was somewhat rural, there were no street
lights aside from the high beams of Bond's Aston Mushroom. &quot;We
were out of there quicker than a Speedy Comet!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You can call me Jelectro, and I had no more answers for
them.&quot; Bond said apprehensively. Kylie could swear he seemed
disturbed about something.</p>
<p>&quot;But why? Richard is well... a Richard all right, but the did
have a point. You have more mysteries than the Forest of Illusions!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I do not mean to be vague on purpose. Well, I do often, but
not all of the time. Do not share this info with others, mon ami,
but-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;-What?&quot; Kylie was finally starting to feel creeped out.</p>
<p>&quot;Not all of my spy skills are spy skills. You see, have
premonitions,&quot; he said simply, &quot;I always have.&quot;</p>
<p>His exotic charm on her had worn off. In Kylie's mind, he might as
well have told her that he was Santa Claus. &quot;Oookay. And so you
just 'know' something is going to go down tomorrow?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. It hit me while we were setting down, what I saw...was
bad... What is wrong, mon ami, what are you-?&quot;</p>
<p>Kylie hopped out of the car seat in disgust. &quot;I didn't become
a reporter and journalist to deal with tomfoolery. What is this? Boo
Hunters? How did you really get this info? How did you even know
where I lived?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I just knew. You have to listen!-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;-You ain't really from Spy Land are you?&quot; she asked
accusingly.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes I am! I trained at the Super Spy Headquarters and
everything. It's just that, as long as I remember, I have had dreams
and visions and...I am adopted you know!&quot; Bond blurted out.</p>
<p>&quot;Take off those sunglasses,&quot; Kylie asked. She suddenly
needed to see his face.</p>
<p>&quot;Excuse moi?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Take them off, Mr. Jelectro Bond,&quot; she said sternly,
&quot;If that's really your name!&quot;</p>
<p>Bond slowly removed this thick sunglasses. Once Kylie saw his eyes
she gasped. They had a milky white appearance that Kylie got mildly
lost in, before snapping out of it.</p>
<p>Kylie gawked. &quot;What in tarnation?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mon ami, wait! This is just because I am having my
er...visions now!&quot;</p>
<p>Kylie ran to her apartment without looking back.</p>

<p><strong>Morning</strong></p>
<p>As usual, the Mario brothers were called in to fix an early
morning leak. It wasn't going so well however.</p>
<p>&quot;M-Mario! Come quick!&quot; Luigi screamed.</p>
<p>Water was up to his knees and the source of it, the toilet, showed
no signs of stopping the downpour. Or uppour...either way, water shot
up and drenched Luigi.</p>
<p>&quot;Luigi, you forgot plumber school rule #34: never turn your
back to a leak!&quot; Mario lectured.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought that was- *gah* rule #47, big bro,&quot; Luigi
replied, having to spit out toilet water also.</p>
<p>&quot;Eh, well maybe so. Either way here-&quot; Mario tossed a
monkey wrench to Luigi.</p>
<p>&quot;Yoshi! Yoshi!&quot; Yoshi called from the door way. He
jumped up and down in the water, splashing it everywhere.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it's good Yoshi finally got over his water phobia,&quot;
Mario chucked. &quot;Now if only we could get him to stop eating the
snacks! Hmm. Wonder what's for dinner?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mario? Not now!&quot; Luigi grunted as he struggled to shut
the leaking valve with the undersized monkey wrench. &quot;It's like
this water is throughout the whole buil- WATCH OUT!&quot;</p>
<p>Pop! A screw flew off out a pipe and hit the wall behind them,
cracking the drywall. Steam poured into the lavatory, making it hard
to see or breathe. The toilet continued in its surge of water, not
unlike a raging volcano, only grosser of course.</p>
<p>&quot;M-mario! What now?&quot; Luigi asked in desperation. The
water was up to his neck.</p>
<p>&quot;Who knows? You're the leader now!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?! What do you mean, bro?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's all on you, Luigi,&quot; Mario said with a odd grin.</p>
<p>&quot;But this is *phew* this is...*gah* NOT FAIR!&quot; Luigi
struggled to keep his head above the water. Mario and Yoshi were
suddenly out of site. There was now enough water to swim in and his
head was about to hit the ceiling. It's showed no sign of stopping as
Luigi was forced to take his last deep breath. All of the air in the
room was gone...</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Beep Beep Beep!</p>
<p>Eight o'clock AM. Mario slammed on the alarm clock. He peeked over
in the darkness and saw Luigi asleep.</p>
<p>It was a normal morning at the Mario Brother's house. Mario had a
good sleep, or at least he thought he did considering that he didn't
use his 'Koopa Kanine Klamp' sleeping mask. He went through his
morning ritual of shower, shave, fix breakfast as though there was no
care in the world. Ten minutes or so later, Luigi joined him in the
kitchen, looking like he'd been ran over by the Mushroom Bus.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey bro? What's up?&quot; Mario asked as he read the morning
paper.</p>
<p>Luigi stumbled into the bathroom without a response. As Mario
continued to eat, he reflected on the past day. A lot had happened,
that was for sure. Just last morning, no one knew of his friendship
with Bowser and now most of his closest friends did, aside from Toad
and Daisy. The thought of their names made him anxious. What had
those agent health people done with them? And what did they plan to
do? Mario also regretted some of his decisions. He was fortunate his
friends even wanted to deal with him anymore with the antics that
went down. Bowser was to blame, he rationalized. Bowser had a weird
way of making him act differently, for reasons he wasn't entirely
sure of. Starting today, he promised himself, he was going to go back
to his normal ways. Hearing Luigi's shower running brought his
thoughts to him. What was it with him and Boo? Why did Luigi take
things so well last night? Mario wasn't sure, but he was certain his
little brother could handle his new leadership. If anyone had
problems with that, he'd make sure they'd reconsider, even if it was
Bowser!</p>
<p>With that last thought, Mario desired to call Bowser, just in case
he decided to behave cantankerously with the new arrangements. He
dialed the number and the phone rang twice before an answer.</p>
<p>&quot;All hail Bowser! State your purpose,&quot; an unfamiliar
voice answered.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello? This is Bowser's number, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...Your phone records identify you as Mario Mario, a
registered enemy! King Bowser will NOT accept personal phone calls
from enemies of his kingdom! Have a rotten day!&quot; the person said
harshly before handing up.</p>
<p>Mario looked at his phone in disbelief, as Luigi exited the
bathroom and plopped down in the chair across him.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey bro...&quot; Luigi mumbled. &quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, nothing. Someone must have hacked Bowser's phone
again..&quot; Mario said, putting the phone away. &quot;Oh, the bacon
is on the stove.&quot;</p>
<p>As Luigi fumbled around the kitchen, Mario's phone made a text
message noise.</p>
<p>It read: Hello Mario. Come over plz.</p>
<p>Mario replied: Who is this?</p>
<p>&quot;Peach silly! Rembr my secret phone?&quot;</p>
<p>Mario slapped himself. Of course! He didn't even have the
Princess's number in his contacts, yet he had Bowser...Peach did not
need to hear him admit that...</p>
<p>She texted a moment later, &quot;Makng a cake. Keep it a secret
frm Bowser tho. We don't want to tempt him. *devil emoji*&quot;</p>
<p>Mario smiled. &quot;Okay. We will see.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can't wait! *peach emoji*&quot; (Yes, that's a thing.)</p>
<p>Mario related the message to Luigi. &quot;Should we?&quot; As
Luigi sat down with a plate full of delicious home cooking, Mario
looked to him expectantly for an answer.</p>
<p>&quot;Huh?&quot; Luigi responded.</p>
<p>&quot;You know, should we have a little fun or go straight to
business? You are the leader now.&quot;</p>
<p>Those words struck a cord with Luigi as memories of his nightmare
came back. He broke out in a cold sweat.</p>
<p>&quot;Bro are you okay?&quot; Mario sat his phone down to look him
straight in the face. &quot;You didn't have a nightmare, did you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ooooh it's uh, actually I just had a dream about...
swimming!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hm, okay then,&quot; Mario said with some suspicion. They
were silent for a moment as Mario sipped some orange juice.</p>
<p>&quot;-But anyway,&quot; Luigi piped up, &quot;let's go to Peach's
place, and have yet another bland cake of hers!&quot;</p>
<p>Mario burst out laughing to Luigi's surprise, juice almost pouring
out of his older brother's nose. Back in the day, the brothers
wouldn't dare joke at the expense of their princess. Now, Peach was
like an old pal and no matter how pretty she was (not that either
brother was infatuated with her anymore anyway) she wasn't exempt
from banter.</p>
<p>&quot;Good one! Okay, we'd better get there soon. We've got a
bright day ahead of us!&quot; Mario said, returning to his paper.
Luigi continued to eat with his mind going elsewhere.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p><strong>At Yoshi's house.</strong></p>
<p>Yoshi, Dick, and Wiggletron sat at Yoshi's log table, eating a
very nice breakfast consisting of fruits and eggs. The two MKDCU
agents had spent the night there after their abandonment from
Jelectro Bond and Kylie Koopa.</p>
<p>Yoshi bit into an apple. &quot;So that's cool that you love your
job, Wiggs.&quot;</p>
<p>Wiggs put his morning paper down. &quot;Yes. It is rewarding to do
what I adore immensely. I have experienced many interesting
occurrences in the field. In fact, our current mission may be the
most intriguing yet!&quot;</p>
<p>Yoshi nodded admirably to his old friend's optimism for the
future. If only he could say the same about himself...</p>
<p>Dick suddenly got excited, going &quot;Mmmm!&quot; and whatnot.
&quot;Wow! Your eggs taste amazing!&quot; Then smile dropped from his
face. &quot;Wait. What are these?&quot;</p>
<p>Yoshi looked at him funny. &quot;You just said it. Eggs?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; Dick said furrowing his brow, &quot;Is this from
an animal?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah?...I mean, it's Yoshi eggs. Why?&quot;</p>
<p>Dick immediately choked and spat out the eggs, dropping to the
floor gagging and rolling around.</p>
<p>&quot;Richard?!&quot; Yoshi dropped to the floor to help him. He
hoped Dick wouldn't pass out, because he certainly wouldn't be able
to pick the giant Goomba up, or carry him from his treetop home. &quot;Are
you okay?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gah! I'm...I'm...vegan!&quot; Dick exclaimed.</p>
<p>Yoshi gave him another weird look. &quot;Umm. Why did you eat eggs
in the first place then?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good...question...&quot; Dick said exhaustedly.</p>
<p>&quot;Umm. You gonna answer it?&quot; Yoshi asked annoyed. He knew
that Dick was a piece of work last night, when he insisted on
extremely specific sleeping conditions. He had no idea he'd be a
prima donna at breakfast!</p>
<p>&quot;Richard will not require further assistance. He frequently
forgets about his personal convictions, often in the morning when the
aroma of food is most enticing,&quot; Wiggletron explained,
continuing to glance through the paper.</p>
<p>&quot;Ooookay Wiggs. Thanks for the details. I think,&quot; Yoshi
said, returning to his seat and leaving Dick on the floor to spaz
out. Yoshi and Wiggs were natives of Yoshi's Island and grew up
around each other. They only became distant when Yoshi met Mario and
started to run off with him and his friends. Back in the day, Wiggs
stood out as the most calm and collective Wiggler to ever face the
Earth. Some even rumored that he was a robot! Of course Yoshi knew
that was nonsense, Wiggs was just...different like that. &quot;So
Wiggs, what are you guys going to do today? You said something about
Kylie and James Bond, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Affirmative. Well, Jelectro Bond, that is. We will try to
contact them to reestablish business relations. A new agency will
require a new uniform.&quot; Wiggs (and Dick) were no longer wearing
their hazmat MKDCU suits. In fact they'd decided to burn them last
night, which was Dick's idea obviously. &quot;Consider some of my
ideas!&quot;</p>
<p>Wiggs turned the paper around to reveal a sketch he had made.
Yoshi did a double take. There was a cowboy, a cop, an Indian, a
leatherman...wait.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey there buddy, you tryna say something?&quot; Yoshi
teased.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean, T. Yoshisaur?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing. Just tone down the costumes, people might think
it's...funny!&quot;</p>
<p>By now, Dick had returned to the table. &quot;Wow, eight already?
Thanks for the meal and shack up, but we'd better head out. You got
takeout bags, Mr. Munchakoopas?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just Yoshi please..&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But then how would we know ya from the rest of the Yoshis
running around here? How about we call you 'Munchie'?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Actually no. Don't call me that or I'll hit you,&quot; Yoshi
said sternly.</p>
<p>Dick laughed as if he'd heard a joke. Wiggs just smiled weirdly.</p>
<p>&quot;Just take the bag...&quot; Yoshi moaned, not entirely
unhappy that they, or at least Dick were about to leave. He tossed
Dick a paper sack as he pulled out his phone to call Birdo for the
morning. He had a text message from Luigi.</p>
<p>It read: Hey we will meet at the castle before 9 this morning. Can
u come?</p>
<p>With his loyalty to Mario now shattered, Yoshi considered it
seriously. After one day, he was already tired of Mario's 'frenemy'
issues. Still, Toad and Daisy didn't deserve to suffer for Mario's
drama so he supposed he'd stick with the gang, at least for a little
longer. Also, kind of weird for Luigi to text him. Doesn't Mario
usually organize stuff like this?</p>
<p>Yoshi finally replied: fine.</p>
<p>Just then, he looked up to see Dick and Wiggs leaving.</p>
<p>&quot;Farewell, good friend!&quot; Wiggs said as he waved. Yoshi
waved back. He wouldn't mind talking to Wiggletron again, and
learning more about what he'd gotten into with this health agent
business. Dick on the other hand? What did Wiggs see in him?!</p>

<p>Jelectro Bond was at Main Street, reading a newspaper from a
sidewalk bench.</p>
<p>Or pretending to.</p>
<p>Just ahead and across the street, Kylie Koopa was ordering her
routine coffee and paper from a breakfast stand. Jelectro was heading
towards the MK East hospital on foot, not wishing to drive his very
notable Aston Mushroom in the heavy traffic, when he subconsciously
found himself visiting the very place Kylie was.</p>
<p>Such coincidence.</p>
<p>&quot;Great job, Jelectro. First you give valuable allies the cold
sholder, then you startle the wonderful Kylie, now you find yourself
stalking her from across the street? What is wrong with me?&quot;
Bond scolded himself.</p>
<p>He justified her reaction from last night. It wasn't normal for a
Noki to have such powers. It also wasn't allowed for a secret agent
to either. Their exchange racked his brain so much he decided that he
would decommission himself the moment Mario's friends were safe. He
took one last glance at Kylie, who was ordering something else. He
already knew, a breakfast wrap, extra tomato, hold the lettuce. Curse
his powers again!</p>

<p><strong>Peach's Castle</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Princess, is it necessary to work so hard so early?&quot;
Toadsworth asked among the chaos in the kitchen. Toad servants zoomed
back and forth holding ingredients and mixing them together in a
giant baking pan. Peach watched over the work with nervous
anticipation.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, dear. It must be perfect! I will be perfect!&quot;
Peach replied sweetly.</p>
<p>&quot;Princess, the eggs are beaten. Throw them in?&quot; Toadette
asked. She was one of the volunteers, (un)fortunately. Peach's cakes
were a sight to behold, all of them, because she baked the exact same
one every time. The recipe was from Peach's grandmother, and attempts
to switch things up came to a polite but dead stop when suggested.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, quickly now. The Mario brothers will be here soon!&quot;</p>
<p>Her obsequious staff did just so. Soon the giant pan of cake
batter was wheeled into an even bigger oven. As her servants caught
their breath, Peach bent down next to the oven to peer inside, as if
her expectant gaze would expedite the cooking process.</p>
<p>&quot;Peach goes crazy about her cakes, eh?&quot; A yellow capped
toad, Alagold, whispered to the rest.</p>
<p>Buckenberry, who was in the group, nudged him harshly. Toadette
also shot the him a disapproving glance. Alagold shrugged.
&quot;Whatever...&quot; Peach was just one of many pincesses, not a
goddess, as far as he was concerned.</p>
<p>Toadsworth tapped his cane in the floor for everyone's attention.
&quot;Enough standing around. Let us prepare the tables for our
guests. Come!&quot; He lead the way out of the kitchen and everyone
sans Peach followed.</p>

<p>It was a little before eight in the morning when Emery walked into
Mushroom Kingdom Hospital East for her usual all day shift. The
forecast called for a cool and cloudy day, so she wore a black hooded
jacket. The hospital was still busy inside, and she over heard the
pleas of people at the reception desk. Friends and or family suddenly
falling out into a deep sleep? Emery thought about what she'd heard
last night. She needed to get to her computer right away!</p>
<p>&quot;Hello Emery. Sleep well?&quot; Nurse Nass T. asked her
daughter as she passed her in the hallway. Nass was standing right in
front of the elevator, looking over the lobby.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh uh, hi mom... Is it what I think it is?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. Unfortunately many more are now sick,&quot; she replied
with a slight edge in her voice.</p>
<p>Emery shook her head. &quot;Wasn't it just a handful yesterday?
What if this is-&quot; Emery stopped herself.</p>
<p>&quot;What if what?&quot; Nass asked as she finally looked Emery
in the face. At that moment mother and daughter realized that they
were both hiding something from each other.</p>
<p>&quot;What if-What if- I GOTTA GO TO THE BATHROOM?&quot; Emery
blurted out.</p>
<p>Nass T. looked at her confusingly, but let it go. &quot;Can't you
use the one upstairs? Get to your post, now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Umm. Yeah I guess,&quot; Emery muttered as she finally
walked pass her to enter the elevator. &quot;Bye mom...&quot;</p>
<p>Nass continued to look at her weird as the elevator doors closed.
Emery let out a deep breath. Once she was at her post on the roof,
she wasted no time looking into the files of every patient that had
been checked in since a day or so ago from her computer. There was
little common ground at first. All ages, backgrounds, species and
genders were affected. Since said patients were unconscious, no
personal accounts could be gained from them. From the recounts of the
friends and family of the patients however, she could see that they
often mentioned that beverages had been consumed before the fallout.
Most were unspecified about the beverage but a few name dropped
'<em>FungusUp</em>'.</p>
<p>This caught her attention immediately. Why would that infamous and
discontinued drink pop up? Surely all cans of it in existence would
be way past it's expiration date. Where would these people even get
it? The recounts of friends and family didn't mention that. Still,
that was something. Now it was just a matter of waiting for Bond to
show up. She cut on her radio, tuned in to the Golden Oldies station,
pulled out her snacks, loaded up a game on her phone, and leaned back
in an attempt to get comfortable. For some reason it didn't work this
time...</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p><strong>Toadley Clinic</strong></p>
<p>The clock struck 8:00 AM when Sebastian's phone died. He was at
the Toadley Clinic, opposite of MK Hospital East in many ways. Not
busy, not well liked, not sanctioned by Peach, and definitely not a
symbol of hope.</p>
<p>The Snifit groaned. &quot;Billy? Where's your battery power pack?&quot;</p>
<p>The Paratroopa next to him shot him a glance. &quot;It's dead too,
'cause you used it up last night playing them stupid games! When is
Jimmy coming back? They've been gone back there for hours!&quot;</p>
<p>Sebastian shrugged. &quot;I kind of miss them, you know?</p>
<p>&quot;Who?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You know, Wiggs and Dick? We never got to say goodbye...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good riddance. They were two peas in a pod, I say! Besides,
we knew Dick was gonna get booted soon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, but...&quot; Sebastian trailed off as he suddenly felt
guilty. &quot;Never mind.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's right. Now shut up.&quot;</p>
<p>Sebastian huffed. &quot;That's a lot of talk for someone that
hides behind dollhouses!&quot;</p>
<p>Parabilly crossed his arms. &quot;Well, I didn't lock the dern
keys in the truck and let it get towed!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well you!-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shhhh!&quot; the front desk receptionist said. The restless
and sleep deprived agents were forced to silently glare at each other
as they continued to wait.</p>
<p>Meanwhile...</p>
<p>Dr. Toadley, the local crazed doctor, rubbed his hands together as
he read the computer's reports aloud. Toad and Daisy were restrained
in glass containers and sedated. The advanced scans run on them took
all of the early morning hours, but the result was now clear.</p>
<p>&quot;No rash present. Unconsciousness. Extreme brain activity.
Coma walking.&quot; Dr. Toadley turned to Jimmy with an odd smile.
&quot;No doubt Mr. James, MUSHROOM FLU!&quot;</p>
<p>...Mushroom flu, known as 'MF'. One of the most destructive
diseases in all the land. The final result was always total insanity
before death.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh. I see,&quot; Jimmy M. responded, not exactly sure what
there was to smile about. &quot;Guess it's the maximum severity
hospital after all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is this very bad? Yes it is. I have not seen MF in so long!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Me neither, doc. Me and my whole squad had no idea, and
we're the experts! Guess I outta... call someone?&quot;</p>
<p>Dr. Toadley looked to him suspiciously. &quot;Who?&quot;</p>
<p>Jimmy threw his hands up. &quot;I don't know! Eldstar knows that
only Dr. Mario can save em now! Still though, maybe the princess?&quot;</p>
<p>Dr. Toadley turned away and laughed wildly at a nonexistent joke.</p>
<p>&quot;Where's the bathroom?&quot; Jimmy asked, eager to excuse
himself.</p>
<p>&quot;FYI FYI Lobby lobby!&quot; Toadley's bird announced
suddenly, making Jimmy jump. He took one look at the bird and the
doctor, and high tailed it.</p>
<p>A moment later...</p>
<p>&quot;Boys!&quot; Jimmy called to Parabilly and Sebastian as he
entered the lobby. They looked to him expectantly. Parabilly jumped
up as if he couldn't wait to get away from Sebastian.</p>
<p>&quot;Sir, yes sir!&quot; Parabilly answered.</p>
<p>Jimmy ignored the clown show and took a deep breath. &quot;It's
MF...&quot;</p>
<p>The agents gasped.</p>
<p>&quot;I know, I know. How could this be? Who knows, but we gotta
get em to the Special World hospital by tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Jimmy, shouldn't we tell the princess?&quot; Sebastian
asked.</p>
<p>Jimmy rubbed his eyes. &quot;Er, yeah I was getting to that.
Actually we'll tell the newspaper!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah. That makes since. Peach ain't a doctor, unless she's
in an RPG I mean. The paper will spread it around and- something
might happen. It's the best we can do really. In fact, we'll head
there now!&quot;</p>
<p>The two agents groaned. They weren't about to get any rest anytime
soon.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p><strong>Mushroom Press</strong></p>
<p>Kylie Koopa glanced at her watch as she entered the doors of the
Mushroom Press; it was 8:30 already.</p>
<p>&quot;And I thought going by foot would actually save time...&quot;
she said to herself. Her idea to walk to work to avoid the horrid
Toad Town morning traffic failed miserably. By now all of the typical
staff were inside and busy getting ready for their competing evening
papers.</p>
<p>&quot;About time, you showed up,&quot; a Toad reporter teased as
she passed him.</p>
<p>Kylie ignored him and sat in her station. She had determined to
still pursue the case for Mario's friends, WITHOUT that Bond freak's
help.</p>
<p>&quot;Why you so down, babe? Mad cause my paper outsold yours?&quot;
he asked facetiously.</p>
<p>&quot;Shut your beak,&quot; she spat back, not bothering to turn
around, &quot;Your paper is no better than a fake-as-plastic gossip
magazine! Your idea of a scoop is Peach painting her nails a
different color!&quot;</p>
<p>The Toad's face twisted in annoyance. &quot;Whatever! All I'm
saying is our Kingdom Enquirer sells way more than your Koopa
Kronicle. What, are you about to have a top story that involves the
importance of the whole kingdom?&quot;</p>
<p>Kylie spun her chair around to face him. &quot;I'll have you
know-&quot;</p>
<p>Someone pounded furiously at the door and opened it at the same
time. It was a Monty Mole wearing a bright yellow hazmat suit.</p>
<p>&quot;Jimmy M. of the Mushroom Kingdom Disease Control Unit!&quot;
he announced theatrically. Everyone inside gawked at this. A front
customer service rep approached Jimmy.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, sir. Would you need anything?&quot;</p>
<p>Jimmy plopped down in a chair, out of breath. &quot;What do I
need? Uh, a drink of water would be fine. No wait, I need coffee.
Yeah...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay sir, but this is a newspaper press, not a restaurant.
Was that all?&quot;</p>
<p>Jimmy leaned up. &quot;Oh yeah, that! Okay, I gots some important
news too. You all are familiar with the incident that canceled
yesterday's tennis game, right?&quot;</p>
<p>The reporters and writers nodded, Kylie got especially interested.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, according to what has been discovered at the Toadley
Clinic, Toad and Daisy gots Mushroom Flu!&quot;</p>
<p>Everyone gasped. Then the sound of loud typing was heard. Some of
the reporters and writers were already organizing articles on this.
Kylie shook her head at her fellow reporter's over eagerness. They
hadn't even heard any real facts for a &quot;mega scoop&quot;, as
she'd put it. In the midst of the commotion, she approached Jimmy
herself.</p>
<p>&quot;James? Nice to meet you, I'm Kylie.&quot; She reached out to
shake his hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello miss. What are you, a celebrity?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wrong Kylie. I'm a reporter and you say they have MF? Is
this certain?&quot; She had her notebook ready for his response.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah no doubt. Listen kid, there's something fishy behind it
but that's not my business really. All I can tell you is that we'll
have to move em to the Special World hospital tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>This news made Kylie's heart stop. &quot;Uh, thank you for your
time..&quot; She said finally, attempting a poker face.</p>
<p>&quot;Heh kid, you aren't gonna ask about us?&quot; Jimmy asked
humorously, &quot;The MKDCU? It's almost like you knows about us
already!&quot;</p>
<p>Kylie nervously laughed along, happy their Snifit driver wasn't
around to tattle about her previous day's snooping. She'd prefer to
not show her hand yet.</p>
<p>&quot;So anyway,&quot; Jimmy started again, &quot;Where's that
water or coffee?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Near the reception desk,&quot; Kylie answered, grabbing her
things. She left right away, through the back exit. It was time to
return to MK Hospital East.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>&quot;And stay out!&quot; the taxi driver yelled.</p>
<p>Dick kicked the taxi as it sped off.</p>
<p>&quot;Good riddance then!&quot; he screamed into the street. They
were a block away from the Mushroom Press.</p>
<p>&quot;It is past 8:30. We should have arrived sooner, Kylie is
sure to be busy now,&quot; Wiggs said with a hint of disappointment.</p>
<p>Dick turned to him sympathetically, &quot;Well we tried! It's that
idiot taxi driver that held us up and that's why I only gave him one
coin! Don't give me that look...We're unemployed right now and we
gotta save enough money for lunch. I don't think your pal 'Munchie'
will feed us again for free after I spazed out on his floor.&quot;</p>
<p>Wiggs', who was looking to him disapprovingly at first, face
softened after his last statement. Dick's flippant humor never
offended him like it would coming from anyone else. Then Wiggs
realized that he'd been staring.</p>
<p>Dick raised on eye brow. &quot;What? Stop smiling at me like that,
Wiggs. You are strange...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not as strange as someone who forgets that he is vegan!&quot;
Wiggs laughed.</p>
<p>Dick didn't have an insult to say back, so he could only laugh at
himself as they approached the building. Once they got close both
stopped dead in their tracks. A white van illegally parked very close
to the door?</p>
<p>Dick gawked. &quot;That the Bonzai Bill are they doing here!?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have several theories actually,&quot; Wiggletron droned,
back to his typical manner of machine like disinterest.</p>
<p>Dick marched ahead, smoke practically pouring from his nostrils.
He passed by the driver door to peer inside. The moment his eyes meet
with Parabilly, who was in the passenger spot, the latter let out a
girly scream.</p>
<p>&quot;What the?&quot; Sebastian gasped from the back seat.
&quot;Richard?&quot;</p>
<p>Dick ignored them for the moment, turning to enter the Mushroom
Press's entrance.</p>
<p>A second later, Wiggletron caught up. He looked apologetically to
Parabilly, who was wetting himself. &quot;I am very sorry. Did
Richard threaten anyone?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; Sebastian answered. &quot;Wait! Wiggs I- I mean,
what's going on?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No time to answer.&quot; Wiggletron turned around to enter
the building. He was greeted to the most chaotic news paper press
ever. People were typing furiously on the computers, people were
making loud phone calls, and papers were flying everywhere. In the
corner near the reception desk, Dick had Jimmy cornered.</p>
<p>&quot;What are you doing here? What do you know?&quot; Dick
demanded.</p>
<p>&quot;Me?&quot; Jimmy jumped with such fever that he spilt his own
coffee everywhere. &quot;What are YOU doing here? What happened to
your suit?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's not how it works now, buddy! I can beat you up if I
want to, you aren't the boss of-&quot; A hand tapped him on the
shoulder.</p>
<p>&quot;Please do not get us arrested,&quot; Wiggs interrupted
calmly, &quot;We cannot complete our mission in jail. Besides, should
we not be inquiring of Kylie?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mission? I knew something was going on with you two!&quot;
Jimmy said. &quot;Besides, that Kylie chick left a moment ago.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dang!&quot; Dick cursed. &quot;But where?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Possibly the hospital,&quot; Wiggs said. &quot;Remember what
Bond said to Emery?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yeah, that Bond pipsqueak. Wonder where he lives?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nokis are typically natives of Noki Bay, unless Bond is
illegitimate somehow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you not familiar with the Isle Delfino adoption
process?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Umm, no. I know my family, unfortunately. You?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I adore my parents very much, thank you...What were we
conversing about?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;About Bond! I thought you liked him?&quot;</p>
<p>Wiggs gawked. &quot;Excuse me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, excuse me,&quot; Jimmy interjected, &quot;You twos know
I'm still standing here, right?&quot; Dick and Wiggs both stared at
him stupidly. Jimmy used that moment of awkwardness and confusion to
squeeze past them and back out of the front entrance.</p>
<p>&quot;Earth to Goomba and Wiggler over there. Do you two need any
help? This is not a restaurant by the way.&quot; The front desk
person asked in a curt fashion.</p>
<p>Dick, recovering himself asked, &quot;Quick woman, does the
Mushroom Bus run around here?&quot;</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>After breakfast, the Mario Bros sped off the castle in a Mach bike
modified to fit a extra passenger with its side kart. Mario drove,
and Luigi was in the side kart. Traffic was rough so it was past 9 AM
before they could see the castle coming up.</p>
<p>At a particularly long stoplight, Mario spoke. &quot;Shame I
couldn't get in touch with Bowser. I mean, I wouldn't invite him
exactly, but it was so weird what happened with his phone earlier.&quot;
Mario attempted to speak idly, but Luigi detected his uneasiness.</p>
<p>&quot;He might be your friend, bro, but he probably has kingly
stuff going on too. Besides,&quot; Luigi lowered his voice, &quot;You
think Bowser has told anyone about your guy's secret?&quot;</p>
<p>Mario hesitated. &quot;Well...I dunno... Ooh, I smell the cake
from here!&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi sniffed, confirming the enticing smell. Soon his stomach
caught wind of it and growled. He'd let Mario's abrupt change of
subject go this time. &quot;Me too, bro. It's one of her giant ones
again!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, fit to feed the whole kingdom!&quot;</p>
<p>The Mario brothers looked towards each other and then laughed.
Once they got to the castle, Alagold greeted them from the front
porch.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey guys! Nice bike.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks,&quot; Luigi said.</p>
<p>Mario looked towards Alagold slyly, &quot;Hey buddy. Tell me, how
big is the cake?&quot;</p>
<p>Alagold rolled his eyes. &quot;One of the biggest yet! Took about
ten of us to put the pan in the oven, and when it was done it took
twenty minutes just to spread the icing. You'd better enjoy it
'guests of honor', or else!&quot;</p>
<p>Mario nudged Luigi. &quot;You hear that? We're practically
royalty. Wonder why the Princess is is such a good mood today?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Beats me,&quot; Alagold answered. &quot;Now hop out you two.
I wanna ride your bike to to parking area.&quot;</p>
<p>The brothers hopped out and made their way into the castle.
Toadsworth was ready the moment they entered the doors.</p>
<p>&quot;Greetings Master Mario and Luigi! Right this way!&quot; He
lead the brothers into the dining area. Things were quiet since it
was still morning, and it was clear that the get together was meant
to be a private and small affair. Toadsworth swung open the dining
room doors. On the table was the giant cake itself. It was a two
layer cake as big as a queen sized bed, decorated in white and pink
inching.</p>
<p>&quot;Mmm mm!&quot; The Mario bros said in unison.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello guys, teehee!&quot; Peach spoke from behind the cake.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh wow! This one even talks!&quot; Mario jest.</p>
<p>Peach groaned. &quot;It's me, Peach! Now come around and sit!&quot;</p>
<p>The Mario brothers went to the end of the table where Peach was.
Peach was dressed in one of her fancy pink dresses. Her blonde hair
was also made up in a extra nice way. She was definitely having a
good morning.</p>
<p>&quot;Hi Princess...I mean Peach!&quot; Mario said, taking a seat
next to her. &quot;You ever think about feeding a village with
these?&quot; He gestured to the cake.</p>
<p>Peach rolled her eyes. &quot;I just thought that we could eat and
discuss our plans. You know, the plans we're going to make together?&quot;</p>
<p>Mario caught the hint. &quot;Actually that sounds good. Right,
Luigi?&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi, who had helped himself to a slice of the cake mumbled, &quot;Uh
hm?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Mario continued, &quot;Luigi has all sorts of
nice things planed I'm sure. I know we're late, but did Yoshi make
it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, he arrived a moment ago. He's in the restroom,&quot;
Peach answered. Just then Buckenberry walked up to the trio.</p>
<p>&quot;What would you like to drink?&quot; he asked formally.</p>
<p>&quot;Cool Blue, what's up?&quot; Mario greeted.</p>
<p>&quot;Ha uh, n-nothing...&quot; Buckenberry flushed. Mario always
turned him into a softy. &quot;So what did you want again?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh just water. Luigi, what do you want?...Luigi?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hmm?&quot; Luigi mumbled. He was really preoccupied with his
slice of cake, or pretending to be.</p>
<p>&quot;Er, water too. Hey Yoshi!&quot;</p>
<p>Yoshi walked in. &quot;Hi guys,&quot; he greeted curtly. Before
Mario could question his behavior, Alagold ran into the dining room
in a panic.</p>
<p>&quot;Guys guys!&quot;</p>
<p>Mario stood up. &quot;What's wrong?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When when...after I parked the bike there was...this...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What are you trying to say?&quot; Peach asked sternly.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a messenger from Bowser!...Uh guys? We can all
scream now...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh just that,&quot; Peach moaned. &quot;Let him in...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay...?&quot; Alagold questioned. He whistled loudly and
soon a Dark Boo floated in.</p>
<p>Everyone looked to it suspiciously, aside from Peach, who looked
on with annoyance and impatience.</p>
<p>&quot;What does Bowser want now?&quot; Peach asked sharply.</p>
<p>The Dark Boo cleared its throat. &quot;Ah-hem, hehe. King Bowser
Koopa has a video message for Princess Peach!&quot;</p>
<p>At this Mario's face softened. A video message from Bowser had to
be something silly. He was probably trying to annoy the Princess for
a laugh. In fact, he'd probably text Mario later just to see what
Peach's reaction was. No big deal.</p>
<p>The Boo pulled out a tablet device. Buckenberry in his usual
bravery approached the Boo to hand it over to Peach. Mario, Luigi,
Yoshi, and Alagold all stood close to see the screen. Peach pressed
play without hesitation.</p>
<p>The video was of Bowser from a front view, setting on his throne.
He looked menacingly but vacantly towards the camera. Mario also
noticed a pink flowery necklace he was wearing.</p>
<p>&quot;And action!&quot; Someone off camera croaked.</p>
<p>&quot;Greetings Princess Peach! This is your future lord and king,
Bowser. I have news for you and your friends. Toad and Daisy are sick
with the Mushroom Flu!&quot; Bowser paused intentionally.</p>
<p>&quot;WHAT?&quot; Everyone watching gasped. Peach dropped the
tablet on the table in shook.</p>
<p>After a moment Bowser resumed. &quot;That is right, citizens of
the Mushroom Kingdom! The reanimated virus is from my lab and I
infected them by airborne pollutants. Unless you surrender to me,
Princess, I will infect even more. Already, as you get this message,
a number of your citizens are currently infected by means of secret
agents I have deployed in your land. Please consider my offer, unless
you want your entire kingdom to go mad! You have one day...&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser stared blankly for a moment before someone whispered,
&quot;Laugh evilly, my lord!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gahahahahahaha!&quot; Bowser laughed. His tone, while
threatening, seemed forced in a way everyone recognized but couldn't
pinpoint. The transmission ended as everyone gaped. The Dark Boo
cackled with laughter at their reaction.</p>
<p>&quot;Better watch your back! Hehe!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hold on just a second!&quot; Mario commanded, jumping out of
his seat again.</p>
<p>&quot;Hehehehe. Gotta go! Hehehehe!&quot; The Boo's laugh faded as
it disappeared in a cloud of smoke.</p>
<p>&quot;Princess what does this mean?!&quot; Luigi asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Bowser wants...&quot; Peach trailed off, her voice shaking.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, he can't have you!&quot; Buckenberry shouted, glancing
towards Mario for support. Mario nodded.</p>
<p>Peach clasped her hand together in nervous habit. &quot;But my
people! If he spreads it..&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;-Princess! Master Mario! Master Luigi! Everyone else! What
was the meaning of that visitor?&quot; Toadsworth asked as he barged
into the dining room in a hysterical manner. Toadette wasn't far
behind. Actually, the whole castle was stirring as if they'd gotten
the memo too, and they had. The tablet's transmission had played over
the castle's intercom system.</p>
<p>Mario pounded his fist on the table. &quot;Cool Blue is right. We
won't let him have you, Princess! I don't know why or how he'd do
this when-&quot; Mario stopped himself before he got too personal
with his feelings. &quot;Anyway, this is clearly a real threat
against you and everyone else!&quot;</p>
<p>Peach turned to him expectantly. &quot;Will you really fight him?
Even after...you know?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; Alagold asked. &quot;Why are we hesitating to
kick Bowser's tail for the hundredth time?&quot;</p>
<p>Everyone sans Toadsworth looked to him guiltily, simultaneously
forgetting that he wasn't in on the secret.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll explain later,&quot; Mario answered regretfully. &quot;But
I'm getting ahead of myself. What's the call, Luigi?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Luigi?&quot; Peach asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Mario said with finality, &quot;I made him
leader. Again, what's the call, bro?&quot;</p>
<p>With all of the attention in the room then being directed to
Luigi, instead of shrinking back in his usual way, something in his
mind clicked. This was his time to shine. The time to show others
that he could be considered just as reputable as his older brother.
With the way Mario had been handling things recently, maybe he could
be even better. He had his answer.</p>
<p>&quot;If Bowser wants war, we'll give it to him. We can make it to
his castle and beat him before the day is over. That way, no one else
will get hurt!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;With what army?!&quot; Peach interjected.</p>
<p>&quot;Us,&quot; Luigi said, looking towards Mario, Buckenberry,
and Alagold. Then he turned to Yoshi. &quot;Will you tolerate us
too?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes!&quot; Yoshi answered with eagerness that surprised even
himself.</p>
<p>Luigi then looked at them determinedly. &quot;Frenemy or not,
let's bust Bowser!&quot;</p>

<p><strong>MK Hospital East</strong></p>
<p>&quot;So Bond, you a fan of soda?&quot; Emery asked, putting her
hood over her head. The temperature was already dropping on the
rooftop. Bond has quietly arrived a moment ago, sometime past 9 am.</p>
<p>&quot;Not really, mon ami,&quot; Jelectro Bond replied flatly.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, okay. So yeah, that FungusUp is definitely the common
denominator here. You guys should look into that. Hey, where is
Kylie?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; Bond muttered.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh...If you don't mind me asking, did you two break up or
something last night? I'm just getting that vibe, I mean, not from
experience, but-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;-You could say that.&quot;</p>
<p>Sensing the awkwardness, Emery just stared at the sky for a while,
the conversation seemingly over. Bond seemed to be lingering around
for some reason and muttering to himself.</p>
<p>&quot;Hmm,&quot; he said to himself, &quot;it's usage must appeal
to nostalgia. People are so stricken by it, that they would drink
figuratively ancient cans of the stuff...Very deliberate...&quot;</p>
<p>The door to the rooftop opened and out came Kylie Koopa! Her and
Bond stared at each other and Emery stared at them staring at each
other. Then the sound of an airship approaching broke the silence.</p>
<p>&quot;Guys,&quot; Emery spoke up, &quot;I know we're having
relationship drama and all, but you'll have to excuse me for a
moment. I gotta do my job for once.&quot; She suddenly did some
signals. &quot;LANDING!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wait. I'm so sorry Kylie! I shouldn't have hidden this from
you-!&quot; Bond blurted out as the airship started to land.</p>
<p>Kylie put her hands up to stop him. On her way to the hospital,
after learning about Toad and Daisy's Mushroom Flu, she realized that
their petty personal issues couldn't get in the way of a more serious
problem. That, and everything Bond said was right, strange powers be
darned. &quot;Hold yer horses, Bond. I'm just here for more info.
They have MF. It's confirmed. I...we, I mean, were right.&quot; The
airship was now hovering over them.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, that's good. Wait, that's bad. Uh, what else?&quot; Bond
asked.</p>
<p>Kylie hesitated before answering. &quot;They're gonna get packed
off to the Special World Hospital. I'm not sure what to do, you got
any ideas? You're the secret agent and all..&quot;</p>
<p>Bond scratched his head. &quot;We have reason to believe that they
were infected by stale FungusUp..&quot;</p>
<p>Kylie gawked. &quot;You mean to tell me that this whole plague
could have been avoided if people didn't munch on stale food?&quot;
Kylie would have laughed if people lives weren't at stake.</p>
<p>&quot;Permission requested to drop off!&quot; Emery announced.
Kylie and Bond paused their conversation as a person sized basket was
slowly lowered from the airship. Two people were onboard, a guard
Toad and a unconscious human with a black beard and a dark colored
mushroom cap. The Mushroom King!</p>
<p>Kylie gaped as Bond furrowed his eyebrows. Emery continued her
procedure despite her own shock. She noticed the Poshley Heights tag
but had no idea it would be Peach's father, who had retired to there
after his daughter started to rule the Mushroom Kingdom. &quot;What
is your name? Right. I already know this is the king. What happened?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He fell out this morning ma'am,&quot; the guard answered
briskly. &quot;We didn't mention our identities in our landing
request on purpose. Can't start too much commotion.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right. So he just fell out? That's it?&quot; Emery asked
seriously, doing a check on the King's pulse.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. Our in house doctors at the palace couldn't find
anything wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, sir? Did our majesty drink any FungusUp?&quot; Kylie
asked.</p>
<p>The guard finally acknowledged Kylie and Bond. &quot;Huh? Who are
you? A nurse?&quot;</p>
<p>Kylie smiled and pulled out a notebook. &quot;Umm, sure. Just
gotta get it on record. Did he?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. This is VERY important,&quot; Bond added in nervous
excitement.</p>
<p>&quot;Well...I don't know what he drunk exactly, but our King was
mentioning something about how he'd found a beverage he hadn't seen
in forever. I don't where it came from. I'm not in the delivery
division, you see. Do I need to find out for sure?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You can, I guess. But that's it!&quot; Kylie announced
excitingly. &quot;I mean, it has to be, right?&quot;</p>
<p>Bond grabbed her shoulder, excited as well. &quot;Surely!
Excellent detective skills, speaking up like that. It has to be
deliberate like I thought.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Deliberate like what?! Might I ask what you nurses are
talking about?&quot; the guard asked in a stern and suspicious
manner. He approached the 'nurses' expectantly.</p>
<p>Stepping forward a bit, Bond said, &quot;We should be open about
this at this point. There is a conspiracy and it involves the
Mushroom Flu!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What!?&quot; the guard gasped. &quot;I must inform our
advisors in Poshley Heights immediately! How could this even happen?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, someone is using FungusUp to infect them. Also we know
that MF could only come from Bowser's Castle. Do the math, mom ami.
This is a Bowser plot, and a rather ruthless one at that.&quot; Bond
spoke in a serious but low voice, much like his old self. Emery had
qualms with his statement, but kelp silent.</p>
<p>&quot;Eldstar in Star Heaven! Call the Mario brothers!&quot; the
guard demanded. &quot;Our King is at stake!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You and the royals can count on us! In fact, we're wise to
it all know,&quot; Kylie responded. Bond nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah and umm, let's get the King in a room,&quot; Emery
said, entering a code on the computer. &quot;I'm calling backup.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now what will happen?&quot; the guard asked Emery in a
frenzy.</p>
<p>&quot;Huh? Oh...Dr. Mario!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yeah, that's right!&quot; Kylie chipped in, &quot;According
to my last report on this disease, only Dr. Mario had a cure, but no
one knows where he's up and scrammed off to!&quot;</p>
<p>Emery turned from the computer. &quot;Smash Mansion. You know?
That cliche place that's always appearing in Smash brothers
fan-fiction? After being reintroduced in ssb4, he decided to stay
there as a local physician.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Emery, how do you know that?&quot; Kylie asked curiously.</p>
<p>Emery looked around nervously. &quot;Because...because my mom used
to date him!&quot;</p>
<p>Kylie gave a disgusted look. Bond nudged her away from the landing
zone. &quot;Let us find the Mario brothers, shall we?&quot; he said.
Kylie was too shocked to protest.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>Luigi pointed to the plans on black board. He was in his own house
now, along with Mario, Buckenberry, Alagold, and Yoshi.</p>
<p>&quot;So this is the plan,&quot; Luigi said. &quot;Like Peach told
us before, Bowser hadn't captured any fortresses this time, so we can
march straight up to his castle. We'll be done before evening. Right,
Mario?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yeah, and we have fire flowers, cape feathers, tanookis,
the like...&quot; Mario answered, his mind drifting off.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't wait to beat up Bowser!&quot; Alagold exclaimed.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, buddy,&quot; Luigi chuckled, &quot;You'll get your
turn soon enough. Is that knocking I hear?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll get it,&quot; Yoshi said. He opened the door to Boo.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, guys. What's going on?&quot; Boo asked, holding a paper
bag.</p>
<p>&quot;Boo?&quot; Luigi asked, &quot;Sorry I didn't call you
earlier. You might want to come in..&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, okay then,&quot; Boo replied, realizing the serious
mood. &quot;What did I miss?&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi sighed. &quot;A lot. We're at war...with Bowser...&quot;</p>
<p>Boo almost dropped the bag in shock.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, that fiend gave our friends Mushroom Flu, and he wants
the Princess to surrender in one day!&quot; Alagold explained.</p>
<p>&quot;What? That's what's wrong with them? Why would Bowser do
that?&quot; Boo asked.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not sure. Well, I have ideas but...&quot; Luigi's eyes
drifted towards Mario, &quot;Umm, we can theorize later. Point is, we
have a day to stop Bowser or more may get sick.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know,&quot; Yoshi said with a hint of mischief in his
voice, &quot;Maybe, I mean it's just an idea, but what if this was
his plan?&quot;</p>
<p>Mario started. &quot;What do you mean, Yoshi?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, how would Bowser know how to target everyone unless
he'd gotten familiar with us? I mean, Bowser could never parade in
town and get people sick unless he wasn't viewed as a sworn enemy!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hold on,&quot; Mario said quickly, &quot;Bowser didn't say
he did anything himself, he used er...secret agents and...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;-And how is that better? Point is, he hurt our friends and
admitted to it!&quot; Yoshi spat. Alagold nodded in agreement.
Buckenberry gave a worried glance Mario.</p>
<p>&quot;Mario,&quot; Luigi sighed, &quot;They have a point. I'm not
sure why Bowser would do this either but he's clearly done something
and now it's clear that we should do something. Besides, I'm leader
now, remember?&quot;</p>
<p>Mario's head sunk down. &quot;Right...well can't we admit that his
delivery was off?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wait, what are you guys talking about?&quot; Boo asked.</p>
<p>Luigi turned to Boo. &quot;We were at Peach's place this morning
and Bowser sent a video message to us, telling us how he infected
them by air pollutants and secret agents or some junk!&quot;</p>
<p>At this, Boo remembered something. &quot;Hmm. So, he said that
he'd done this to Toad and Daisy and everyone else sick?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, pretty much.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;..And he SAID this?&quot; Boo repeated with some
apprehension.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes?&quot; Luigi answered with mild impatience.</p>
<p>&quot;Never mind, but let me join you guys. Please!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Umm...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I just feel that I need to come along. I promise I won't get
in the way!&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi shrugged. &quot;Okay Boo, fine. What's in that bag by the
way?&quot;</p>
<p>Boo's face lit up. &quot;Oh yeah, I almost forgot, hehe. So I was
in Toad Town and stopped by Merlon's place for a while. He said that
someone had given him a gift but he couldn't drink it so like, he
just gave it to me. I brought it over here to show it to you.&quot;
Boo pulled a can out of the bag. &quot;FungusUp! Remember this
stuff?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yeah!&quot; Luigi said. &quot;Toad loved to drink those,
remember guys?&quot; Everyone nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;Guys,&quot; Mario, who had been lost in thought until then
interrupted, &quot;Hear me out! Something was wrong with Bowser's
message. There was no banter, no passion. He even had to be reminded
to laugh evilly! And what was with that Hawaiian necklace? Was I the
only one who noticed that? Has Bowser ever acted like this?&quot;</p>
<p>Yoshi rolled his eyes. &quot;Does it matter how he delivered it?
Bowser could have been in a Cat Suit and it would still be a threat!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He has actually threatened us in a Cat Suit before.. but
listen,&quot; Mario plead, &quot;just yesterday, Bowser was just as
confused about the whole situation as we were. How could he suddenly
be the cause of it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bro, I know this is hard to believe,&quot; Luigi said
delicately, &quot;but it all makes sense. Mushroom Flu could have
only came from his lab. There's no way around it.&quot; Luigi
approached Mario to lay a hand on his shoulder. &quot;Maybe Yoshi has
a point. Maybe...Bowser lied to you?&quot;</p>
<p>The color drained from Mario's face. &quot;But...but...He
wouldn't!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just face it!&quot; Yoshi said harshly. &quot;Your
friendship was one sided. You just thought he was a frenemy when he
was still an enemy all along. He was probably planning this long ago
and he knew you'd be too nice to see through it!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No!&quot; Mario shouted back, &quot;I don't believe that! I
need to talk to him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; everyone gasped.</p>
<p>&quot;Mario, there's no time to talk things out. We have ONE day!&quot;
Luigi shouted.</p>
<p>&quot;But we have to!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And then what?&quot; Luigi asked, getting in Mario's face,
&quot;They have MF now, no talking will change that! Besides, how
could Bowser possibly justify this?&quot;</p>
<p>Mario stood his ground. &quot;...I thought you believed me when I
said our friendship was real!?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I thought YOU put me in charge!? I say that we put a end to
this, and save our friends!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I say, we talk first before we make things worse!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How could it get worse? Our friends may die, Mario, secret
agents or whatever are apparently running loose, we don't even have a
way on hand to cure them and yet you want to waste time with a
friendly chitchat?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Brute force isn't always the way, I learnt that yesterday! I
rushed into things and the outcome was terrible! You've only been in
charge for one day, so I say you listen to your older brother!&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi gasped offendedly. &quot;Really?! Then I say...I say you're
OFF THE MISSION!&quot; Luigi screamed, surprising everyone with his
tone. The room got silent in a surreal moment. No one had ever
witnessed a real argument between the brothers.</p>
<p>Mario stepped back in disbelief. After a quick scan of the room,
Mario silently turned around with his head down and briskly exited
the house. Buckenberry left after him as Luigi fumed, Alagold and Boo
looked in shock, and Yoshi crossed his arms in a mix of surprise and
guilt.</p>
<p>Outside Buckenberry caught up to Mario.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait! Mario!&quot; he called out.</p>
<p>Mario stoped and turned around, his face red. &quot;What? Oh, Cool
Blue,&quot; he said amiably, &quot;what's up?&quot;</p>
<p>Buckenberry nervously kicked up some dirt. &quot;I uh...I believe
you.&quot;</p>
<p>Mario smiled weakly. &quot;Oh, thanks..&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah. I mean, I know it looks 100% like Bowser is guilty but
you were right about his message being weird.&quot;</p>
<p>Mario sighed. &quot;It does look completely like he's guilty. It's
just...I can't let it go. I don't know how, but it has to be more to
this. I have a theory, but it's crazy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tell me! I won't go away until you do!&quot; Buckenberry
crossed his arms, resulting in a laugh from Mario.</p>
<p>&quot;Ha ha, you always were a go-getter, weren't you? Okay so,
Bowser never really told me how his companions viewed our
relationship so I assumed Bowser never told them. What if like, they
caught wind of it? They might feel betrayed, right? I wouldn't expect
them to be as understanding as you guys and so, well...Maybe the
weirdness in the message was Bowser being coerced to do it somehow? I
mean, that's a big stretch since it happened over night, but you
never know.&quot;</p>
<p>Buckenberry scratched his head. &quot;So, a conspiracy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can't say for sure, but I know Bowser and I know something
isn't right. I just need to talk to Bowser before he gets beaten up.
I just feel like fighting him directly is a trap. Still though, Luigi
was right. People are still sick and I don't see any other way to
stop it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No way to- You mean there's no cure?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There is a cure, technically. You see, long ago, we had an
issue with the Mushroom Flu but Dr. Mario took care of it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who?&quot; Buckenberry asked, feeling ignorant. Another con
of being the new guy.</p>
<p>&quot;It's before your time a bit. We're two different people, you
know. I can't explain it, video game logic, but anyway he came up
with a cure and terminated it for good. Natural strands of it, that
is. Problem is, I don't where where he is now..&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh..&quot; They walked silently for a moment.</p>
<p>&quot;-So why did you believe me?&quot; Mario suddenly asked.</p>
<p>Buckenberry started. &quot;Well I came to a realization last night
and stuff. So like if the princess's heart believes that..the pure..I
mean- Never mind, I botched that. Basically, the Princess believes in
you and I look up to you and stuff, okay? And I know we can only get
though this if we support each other and stuff, okay?&quot;</p>
<p>Mario looked his way and smiled. &quot;You're alright, you know
that? I'm not actually mad at my brother. Just surprised. And a
little hurt.. But I made him leader and he gets to carry things out
the way he wants. You go back with the rest. I'll be fine.&quot;</p>
<p>Buckenberry gasped. &quot;What? Why? I want to work with you!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I need to sort out some things myself, okay? Please. If you
like me so much, you'll listen, alright?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...Okay. Fine. But one thing-&quot;</p>
<p>Mario stopped. &quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>Buckenberry gave Mario a hug, pulling back embarrassingly after a
moment. Mario laughed at the random gesture.</p>
<p>&quot;Cool Blue? Is this really you?&quot; he teased. Buckenberry
flushed.</p>
<p>&quot;Just, take care I guess. Are you sure there's nothing I can
do for you, Mario?&quot;</p>
<p>Mario debated on if he should say anything. &quot;...Umm, yeah.
I'd never sabotage Luigi, even after we've fought but, I need you to
stall them slightly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know, I know. Time is short. Don't stop them, just stall.
Like I said, I need to talk to Bowser before his beat down. If it
turns out that..well, I'm completely wrong, we'll fight him just like
old times and that will be that. Sounds good?&quot;</p>
<p>Buckenberry nodded and took off back to the house as Mario headed
for Toad Town.</p>
<p>Luigi was giving a final count on the power ups when Buckenberry
burst through the door. There were five mushrooms, three fire
flowers, one cape feather, two Tanooki suits, and one starman. Not
much, but fine since the only level they were doing was the final
castle.</p>
<p>&quot;So you're back..&quot; Luigi muttered idly.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Buckenberry said, catching his breath. &quot;Mario's
okay.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What is he going to do now?&quot; Luigi asked solemnly,
catching Buckenberry off guard.</p>
<p>&quot;Just...stuff?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Eh, good for him I guess. Let's go.&quot; Luigi picked up
the power up bag.</p>
<p>&quot;We aren't gonna talk about what just happened?&quot; Boo
asked.</p>
<p>&quot;There's nothing to talk about. We have to protect this
kingdom. That's our job.&quot;</p>
<p>Boo decided to drop it for now. &quot;Well what about the
FungusUp?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Isn't that stale by now? Whatever, save it for later,&quot;
Luigi said.</p>
<p>Yoshi, Alagold, Buckenberry, and Boo looked at each other briefly
and then followed Luigi out the door. They headed for the path
leading to Dark Land.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>&quot;Extra extra! Read all about it!&quot; the newspaper salesman
screamed to everyone exiting the mushroom bus. &quot;Mushroom Flu is
mysteriously back!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You hear that?&quot; Dick asked Wiggletron as they exited
the bus. They were dropped off a block from MK Hospital East.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. I continue to be amazed at the swiftness that
newspapers are published.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Me too. I swear they're like magicians! I see em walking
around with that newspaper bag thing and I'm like, 'you're gonna pull
a rabbit out of that too?'&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Actually I worked at a newspaper facility as a teenager for
a period of four months. It was brutal, but I saw no rabbits.&quot;
This caught Dick's interest for some reason.</p>
<p>&quot;Now I didn't know that. Say, how many jobs have you had?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Seven in a half,&quot; Wiggs answered proudly.</p>
<p>Dick chuckled, &quot;In a half?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I was fired from one before I was officially hired. It
was at a Yoshi egg shipping facility back home. I was never known for
delicate maneuvers and I utterly obliterated every one I touched.
Thankfully no unborn children perished that day, they were the-
what?&quot;</p>
<p>Dick laughed wildly, not because the story was funny, but at
Wiggs' dry delivery of it. &quot;Haha, wow! I can only imagine! I
don't have anything as interesting to share. I had no high school
jobs and after school went straight to Giant Land college for my
doctor degree. After that, I scrubbed pipes for a living until I
realized I could be a for hire health agent. Easy cash, baby! So here
I am now! Broke and on a wild goose chase for a weird Noki an
reporter brat. Ain't life great?&quot;</p>
<p>Now Wiggs laughed wildly, not because the story was funny or at
Dick's usual strident delivery. He laughed because, actually he
wasn't even sure himself. Dick just made him laugh a lot. And show a
hint of emotion for once. And have fun, even in bad situations.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, we're back at this stupid place again!&quot; Dick said
and they approached the hospital. &quot;Mushroom Kingdom Hospital
East. More like hospital 'suck'! Am I right? Well that didn't rhyme,
but you're in a giggly mood, aren't ya, Wiggs?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh? Oh uh, yeah Richard. You are great. Ha ha...&quot;</p>
<p>Just then Kylie and Bond exited the building and they almost
collided on the sidewalk. Everyone jumped at the sight of each other.</p>
<p>&quot;Agent Richard and Wigg-&quot; Bond started to say.</p>
<p>&quot;-Get them before they run off!&quot; Dick shouted.</p>
<p>&quot;Wiggs captured Kylie and Bond, grabbing each with a set of
arms.</p>
<p>&quot;Goodness gracious! Let me go!&quot; Kylie demanded, unable
to wiggle from Wiggs' iron grip, &quot;We got business to do!&quot;</p>
<p>Dick shook his head. &quot;I don't think so, sister. You'd better
tell us what's up, orrrrr..&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will never release you from my grasp! Not even if you ask
politely!&quot; Wiggs tried to warn in a threatening way.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay that's kind of weak, but yeah, what he said! Speak up!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe we do owe them an explanation,&quot; Bond said calmly.
Then he took a deep breath. &quot;I apologize for the abrupt
abandonment last night. I will not do that again. Also, we spoke with
Emery. Expired cans of FungusUp are the cause of the illness. Etc.
etc. Bowser is a cunning, diabolical, schemer. Okay, this next part
is shocking...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lay it on me, shorty,&quot; Dick said facetiously.</p>
<p>&quot;I am serious! We just learned that the Mushroom King has
Mushroom Flu!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Whoa, wait, hold up now! Does Peach know this?&quot; Dick
asked seriously.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, we would be heading there if you didn't call your
partner to snatch us up!&quot; Kylie said annoyingly, &quot;Let us
go, brother!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay okay fine. Let em go, Wiggs.&quot; He dropped them.
&quot;Have y'all seen the papers? The word is out!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Richard, but the origin isn't. I don't think...&quot;
Bond paused. &quot;Still. To the Princess and from her to the Mario
brothers. This means war.&quot;</p>
<p>Dick sighed. &quot;How are you so certain? Haven't we been though
this vague junk?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, that. Yes, you see. I know things...&quot; Bond
explained. Kylie started eyeing Bond in a weird way after he said
that.</p>
<p>&quot;Encyclopedically?&quot; Wiggs asked.</p>
<p>Bond put his hands in his pockets and looked at the passing cars.
&quot;I'm not normal, okay? I'm like the 'Chomp Whisperer' but with
people. And I see bad things in the future. And I can never take
these sunglasses off.&quot;</p>
<p>Dick and Wiggs looked at each other mildly disappointed that his
secret wasn't more exciting, like him being an escaped convict or a
space alien. &quot;That all?&quot; Disk asked, &quot;Who cares? Ain't
never heard of a Noki like that but other species are like that all
of the time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We'd better mosey on to the bus stop. It'll be showing up
soon,&quot; Kylie said in an uncharacteristic drone. She glanced at
her watch as she marched ahead of the rest silently. Bond hung his
head and followed, motioning the ex-MKDCU agents to come along.</p>
<p>Dick sighed. &quot;We still haven't discussed our pay, but
whatever. Something went down between those two, and even I don't
wanna get mixed up in it,&quot; he whispered to Wiggs, who nodded
thoughtfully.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>Bowser turned to his side, still feeling tired and with a
headache. He'd need to wake up soon for breakfast; no one else could
eat until he was served, and staying in bed would delay breakfast for
the whole castle. Not that he cared that much, he just didn't want to
hear the moaning he'd get from his family and complains from staff.</p>
<p>He opened his eyes to stare at the ceiling. What was planned for
today? No castle events. No concerts from Ludwig. No scheduled games
from Mario and friends.</p>
<p>Mario and friends...</p>
<p>The thought of yesterday's events almost made his headache worse.
That was a day! He thought he was just going to have a nice game with
Mario as a partner for once and then it turned into a horror show! A
horror show that didn't amount to much, but it was all Mario's fault!
Well, he'd have to admit that he was influencing him a bit, but it
was Mario's job to filter out the bad ideas. He was new to the
'working with heroes' thing, give him a break!</p>
<p>Still, he was a bit worried. No, not worried. Just curious. Yeah,
he didn't care THAT much about Mario's friends, he just wanted to get
to the bottom of it. Also, how was Mario doing? Again, he only cared
about getting to the bottom of things, he wasn't feeling genuinely
concerned or anything. That would be ridiculous. Bowser growing fond
of Mario? What a joke!</p>
<p>Okay, but still. He thought he should probably just check in on
the meddling plumber. He reached over for his phone which normally
sat the dresser next to his bed. Instead, his hand found a cold stone
floor. Come to think of it, his bed was feeling a bit stiffer than
usual. And damp. And there were no covers. And his ceiling was
concrete. And there was no windows...</p>
<p>Bowser jolted, getting up. &quot;Where am I?&quot;</p>
<p>A brief look around confirmed it. A dungeon, his own!</p>
<p>&quot;The heck?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So you're up, King Bowser,&quot; someone said from a cell
across the room.</p>
<p>&quot;Who? What the- am I dreaming?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wonder the same things. No. They put you down here too.
I'm Doctor Professor Koopa.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You mean that crooked doctor that tried to kill Mario!?&quot;
Bowser accused, sounding more concerned then he meant.</p>
<p>Doctor Professor walked up to the bars of his cell. He looked
haggard, surprising Bowser. &quot;I'm sorry. I had to do it. Do you
even know what's going on?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; Bowser thought for a moment, &quot;all I
remember was coming home last night and... my children were throwing
some weird party and... I spoke to Ludwig and...er, the rest is a
blank. I know that once for my birthday, they threw me down here as a
joke but I ain't gettin' any older today! What gives?&quot;</p>
<p>Doctor Professor sighed. &quot;I might as well tell you
everything...it all started when...I started to work for your
castle.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I mean, when you were young, that is. I worked for Kamek
after my service in Peach's Castle. Things were bad. If you think
your employees complain now, you don't even know how harsh it was
working here. I got fired after complaining too much about the
cruelty.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh huh? Where are you going with this, doc? I don't got all
day!&quot; Bowser asked impatiently.</p>
<p>Undeterred, the doctor continued. &quot;So I was fired. And by
fired, I was sent to a camp in Fahr Outpost for some years. My young
life was ruined, but I was released when Dark Land was officially
handed over to you, and Kamek no longer called the shots. I hated
your kingdom. I wanted it gone and that seemed to be the opinion of
the Mushroom Kingdom as well, but then something happened.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Keep talkin..&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I noticed that Mario started inviting you to parties
and sports and whatnot. It became clear to me that Mario and the
Princess had no plans to exterminate you permanently. You were all
pals!&quot; Doctor Professor spoke in sudden fervor.</p>
<p>Bowser clapped. &quot;Bravo. You figured out what I don't think
half of my staff have, and you haven't even been around us. What, so
you got disappointed with my social life? I still don't get what's
going on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yeah. So I was at my new job, at MK Hospital East, when
I overheard some teenagers speaking about what was written on the
back of Toad Town's billboard. The rumor was that you and Mario were
friends! I already knew this, but that revelation prompted me to seek
out someone at your castle. I figured that wouldn't be a popular
opinion among your staff.&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser crossed his arms. &quot;Yeah, that was true...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So I met up with Ludwig and I told him my plight. He said
that only your closest staff were aware and they planned to do
something about it. They could in fact use someone that worked
closely with Peach's own officially sanctioned hospital, and that I'd
be perfect as a secret agent, or a double agent as I said in my
mind-&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser's eyebrows furrowed, but he didn't interrupt.</p>
<p>&quot;-So, he said that people were gonna get sick soon, thanks to
a plan he'd cooked up from your lab. He said to stall Mario's friends
if they caught wind of it. Problem is, things went horribly wrong!
First of all, I myself had no idea it'd would be Mushroom Flu-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;WHAT? That's what it was?&quot; Bowser gasped.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. And I didn't know Toad and Daisy would be some of the
first targets either! Supposedly they used a discontinued soft think
that would make people nostalgic or something.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wut? Why did you work with us? I mean them? You know what I
mean. Why were you trying to hurt Mario if you want him to win?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's the double agent part! The ends justify the means, is
what was going on in my head at the time. I was just one of many who
suffered because of Dark Land. I just had no idea it would get this
serious. You see, Ludwig and the others just wanted the friendship
over. But If that worked, maybe Mario would retaliate by finally
taking your kingdom out. I mean, I didn't really have anything
against you, King Bowser, just that rotten Kamek, but I didn't see
another way hurt him other than hurting you as collateral damage.&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser growled. &quot;Ya hate gramps that much? You'd better be
glad we're separated! Besides, you were double stupid. It's not like
we were all pals or something. Everyone but Mario still viewed me
like an enemy until yesterday. Now tell me, how do I end up in my own
dungeon?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;About that...I haven't seen it, but I overheard guards
talking about a message you sent to Peach this morning. They want to
start a war.&quot;</p>
<p>Bower's eyes popped out of his head. &quot;Gha! What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, but there is hope. When the MKDCU stormed in, they
messed up the plan to keep Toad, Daisy, and everyone else sick at the
hospital. It's possible that Mario and the rest know what the disease
is by now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hold it, hold it,&quot; Bowser said, giving his cell bars a
death grip, &quot;Didn't you say I sent a message? I don't remember a
thing!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know how they did it, but it's true. They put you
down hear early this morning.&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser kicked the bars in anger. &quot;So you, and who else? I
want to have my hit list planned out,&quot; he said through clinched
teeth.</p>
<p>The doctor gulped. &quot;Well, me, Nass T.-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That black haired Toad nurse too?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. I got her in on it. You see, she and I were...well
involved kind of-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;-Cut to the point, doc!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She and I worked together. She jumped at the idea actually,
when we spoke of a prize being rewarded. Yesterday though, she was
acting weird, like she was suddenly trying to sabotage the whole
deal. I think she might have called those agents...&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser leaned his back against the bars in defeat. &quot;Mushroom
Flu eh?... Gosh dangit, this is death sentence! If Mario and company
really believe that I did this, they'll never forgive me.&quot;
Bowser shook his head, extremely disappointed in himself for failing
to see a conspiracy happening under his nose, and at that fact that
his dealings with Mario were probably going to be over, the later
feeling especially surprising himself.</p>
<p>&quot;What'll happen now, then?&quot; Bowser muttered.</p>
<p>Doctor Professor sat down. &quot;I'm not sure, for you that is. My
game might be over soon, that's the danger of dealing with you
enemies.&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser turned to face him quickly. &quot;Yo, doc! Do you really
think I'm the enemy?! I don't want anyone to die! I mean, I'd like to
rule the world and all but I have standards you know! I know things
might of been rough in the past but gramps is from the old-school
world of villainy. I promise you that when I fire someone, they get a
pink slip and broken dreams but I don't ship them off anywhere!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Really?&quot; Doctor Professor asked, &quot;You wouldn't
carry out a plan like this yourself?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Heck no! Pardon my French. It's like a game for us, we don't
try to really hurt anyone. Point is, your bone to pick is with Kamek
and if you're willing to hurt me, and plenty of innocents like
Mario's annoying friends to get to him, who's really the villain
here?!&quot;</p>
<p>Just then, the dungeon door swung open and Kamek entered. He
stopped at the sight of Bowser standing and glaring at him.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, you're awake? Uh, greetings your evilness!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gramps,&quot; Bowser said, approaching the bars again,
&quot;what's the meaning of this?&quot;</p>
<p>Kamek looked around nervously and didn't answer. Bowser repeatedly
stomped the ground in anger.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know WHAT you're up to, but you'd better let me go
or it's your neck!&quot;</p>
<p>Kamek approached Bowser's cell, but kelp a safe distance. &quot;So
you don't know, your nastiness? Mario is probably on his way here
right now. Would you like us to put up castle defenses?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No I don't wanna- are you listening to me? Let me out!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We can't yet. But soon we will, and you'll be feeling just
like your old self- YAAAAH-&quot;</p>
<p>Flooosh! Kamek stumbled back just before the Bowser's flame breath
hit him. The spot where he stood was charred black.</p>
<p>&quot;You are fired,&quot; Bowser roared, &quot;literally!&quot;
His last words echoed in the dark dungeon.</p>
<p>Kamek, still in shock, left the dungeon with energy he didn't know
he had. The doors slammed shut again. Bowser breathed heavily. This
doctor creep was right! While he never got a direct confirmation, it
was clear that closest cohorts were plotting against him, and for
what, Bowser wondered. Did they really want normalcy so much that
they'd resort to this?</p>
<p>&quot;K-king Bowser?&quot; Doctor Professor spoke up.</p>
<p>&quot;WHAT?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why didn't you rat me out?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Bowser glared at him.</p>
<p>&quot;You said that you didn't know what's up? You could have
revealed that you knew their whole plan!&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser stopped for a moment to think. He didn't spill the beans
because he was still in mild disbelief. Also, he thought it may be
safer to play ignorant for a while. Not that this crooked and
vindictive doctor deserved an explanation. &quot;I have my reasons,&quot;
Bowser answered simply. He turned his back to think some more. How
was he going to get out of this? His thoughts were interrupted by
another person opening the dungeon door.</p>
<p>It was Bowser Junior, wearing a Koopa Scout uniform and backpack.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm back from camp early, King Dad, why would you do this?&quot;
Junior bawled.</p>
<p>&quot;Son! I didn't- it's all lie!&quot; Bowser cried out.</p>
<p>&quot;I THOUGHT WE KIND OF LIKED THEM, WHYYYY?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Son, listen to me! Stop the madness! Go to Mario, tell him
it's a trick to make everyone hate each other and find a cure for the
Mushroom Flu!&quot;</p>
<p>Junior stopped crying. &quot;Huh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's the sickness. I don't know how they even got
infected, but do it! Go go!&quot; Bowser told him, pointing to the
door. &quot;What ever happens, I love you! And the rest, even though
I'm mad at them. And Mario and his friends- Wait not like that! Just
go!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Umm, okay, dad. I'll try!&quot; Junior yelled as he exited
as quickly as he came. Bowser continued to look at the dungeon door
sadly as the Doctor, who had been silent and ignored during the whole
exchange, sighed regretfully.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>Elsewhere in the castle...</p>
<p>&quot;So what are we gonna beg for?&quot; Roy asked. The
Koopalings minus Ludwig were lounging around in the castle den
watching tv.</p>
<p>&quot;More allowance!&quot; Larry answered.</p>
<p>&quot;And then we will get Xboxes right?&quot;</p>
<p>Everyone but Wendy cheered.</p>
<p>&quot;You said Sony at first,&quot; Wendy complained. &quot;My
Princess Parlor Sim is ONLY available on the Playststion JPN
network!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, you can just use my account, Wendy,&quot; Iggy said,
changing the channel. &quot;After all, we both like obscure weeb
games..&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Eww no! I don't wanna see the things you've downloaded! I
want my own PlayStation!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What about Nintendo?&quot; Lemmy asked. Everyone booed his
childish suggestion as Ludwig entered the room with a look of
annoyance. He was wearing dark blue jacket and sipping on coffee this
time.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh hey Luddy, what's up?&quot; Iggy said, quickly excusing
himself from the others.</p>
<p>Ludwig leaned in to whisper, &quot;They are surely on the way
now.. Why aren't we doing anything?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because, gramps said not to?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know but..&quot; Ludwig sighed.</p>
<p>Iggy, looking back briefly to make sure no one was paying
attention, whispered, &quot;Look, I know this is crazy for you,
especially since you're the military general and all, but it'll be
over in a day!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And then what? I pondered over the problem all night and now
I'm not so sure this plan will work...&quot;</p>
<p>As they spoke, Wendy, who was preoccupied with the tv, decided to
check her Instagram on her phone. She was looking through her feed
when she noticed a post from Toadette, made this morning. It was a
melancholy picture of the horizon, obviously taken from the top of
Peach's castle.</p>
<p>It was captioned: It's always a sad day when our Kingdom is at
war. Things may never be the same again...(numerous crying and sad
emojis)</p>
<p>Wendy hastily replied, &quot;Toadette? You okay?&quot;</p>
<p>Toadette replied, &quot;No. smh.&quot;</p>
<p>Wendy replied, &quot;?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why are you doing this to us?&quot;</p>
<p>The realization punched Wendy in the gut.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; is all Wendy could say.</p>
<p>&quot;You'd better be. Mario and the rest are heading your way. If
we don't find a cure, me and the rest of the kingdom will never
forgive any of you!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Umm. Okay. Bye. Sorry again,&quot; Wendy said. After a
moment it was clear Toadette wouldn't be replying. Wendy cut off the
phone in shame. She looked to Larry, who was also ignoring the tv for
his phone.</p>
<p>&quot;Pssst!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What, Wendy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Come over here for a moment.&quot;</p>
<p>Larry groaned and scooted closer to her. &quot;Okay, and?&quot;</p>
<p>Wendy sighed then whispered, &quot;Didn't you talk with Toad a
lot?&quot;</p>
<p>Larry looked worriedly. &quot;Uh, yeah... and what of it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We all know this is stupid and wrong. Why are we going along
with it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I dunno. I just like, went along cuz everyone else was..It
would kind of suck to lose them. Toad was my only Facebook friend
that didn't cuss me out and Daisy was...well she never spoke to me,
but she's hot, so there's that!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Ludwig asked, done with
his private conversation with Iggy.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, do we even have a cure for their disease?&quot; Wendy
asked, her change of conscience giving her a confidence boost.</p>
<p>&quot;Mushroom Flu? Why do you suddenly wonder that? We don't, do
not inquire further!&quot; The harshness in Ludwig's voice made the
room quiet, save the tv. Ludwig, noticing this, took a sip of his
coffee and composed himself. &quot;Well, I suppose I can share... The
scientific method that was used to conjure the artificial germs was
reverse engineered from the cure Dr. Mario manufactured, which was in
itself reverse engineered from the virus itself!&quot;</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Ludwig funny.</p>
<p>&quot;Basically, we'd need Dr. Mario to engineer a new cure all
over again,&quot; Iggy explained casually. &quot;Guys, lighten up.
They'll probably be alright! I'm sure they'll figure it all out and
get the cure. Besides the whole point is for them to hate us, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right!&quot; Roy, Morton, and Lemmy agreed. Wendy and Larry
stayed silent.</p>
<p>&quot;By the way,&quot; Ludwig whispered to Iggy, &quot;where is
Junior? He came home early from camp or something?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Off to see his dad.&quot;</p>
<p>Ludwig spit out his coffee in shock. Then Iggy suddenly remembered
why that was bad. Junior wasn't in on their secret!</p>

<p>Mario strolled into the bustling Toad Town. This was going to be a
beautiful day, he thought. The weather was warm and the sky blue, the
only thing ruining it was the frequent smell of exhaust fumes. The
town really had urbanized in recent years with more and more people
owning their very own kart to drive around. Mario could even spot a
Mercedes-Benz or two pass by, reminding him of Brooklyn. The Usonian
resemblance didn't stop there; recent structures were designed to be
sleek and modern and only a few buildings still shaped like the
mushroom structures of old.</p>
<p>After a moment, Mario approached town square to meet a bigger
crowd. Men and women in business suits, parents with children, and
teenagers on cellphones among them, no one seemed to care that Peach
had put the Kingdom in a state of emergency not long ago. In the
past, such an announcement would shut up the citizens in their homes
until the moment Mario and his brother saved the day. Now it was like
any other day. Just another Bowser attack. Mario wasn't entirely
surprised, because Peach wasn't actually kidnapped in this
&quot;emergency&quot;, and she also omitted the fact that Mushroom
Flu was apparently being spread by secret agents, for the sake of
avoiding panic. For all the kingdom's citizens knew, the emergency
involving Bowser could have been him invading a land on the other
side of the globe. Still, the change of social climate from what he
used to remember made Mario feel older than he was.</p>
<p>After waiting forever to finally be able to safely cross the
street, because he refused to jay walk like everyone else, Mario made
his way to the post office. Despite recent developments surrounding
the humble wooden structure, it hadn't changed a bit inside or out.
As he entered, he was greeted by the aged but active Postmaster, a
Paratroopa with a busy grey mustache and thick glasses.</p>
<p>&quot;Long time no see. You have no letters, guess nobody's
worried about you!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh I just have a little something to send off,&quot; Mario
said walking up the counter.&quot;And you know, a lot of people don't
really get written letters anymore.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's tomfoolery!&quot; the Postmaster exclaimed. &quot;I
get letters all the time, son! You need more friends!&quot;</p>
<p>Mario laughed at the irony as he handed him a letter labeled for
'Smash Mansion'. &quot;I need first class mail. I have the money.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mario, it's on the house for you. No need to fret, we
deliver no matter what, remember? Who's it for?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can't say. It's a secret,&quot; Mario said with a wink.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, fair enough. Whatdaya think of this Mushroom Flu issue?&quot;
the Postmaster chucked.</p>
<p>&quot;What..was that again?&quot; Mario asked, trying to hide his
surprise.</p>
<p>The Postmaster put a label on the envelope. &quot;Mushroom Flu.
You heard of it, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, but why would you bring that up?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's all over the papers. See here?&quot; The Postmaster
pulled out a drawer and gave Mario the day's paper. This particular
one was 'The Kingdom Enquirer'.</p>
<p>The headline read: MK citizens struck by 'MF'!</p>
<p>Mario gasped and immediately read out loud front page article.
&quot;According to rich entrepreneur 'James Monty', the president of
the ministry of health, Toad Toadstool and Princess Daisy Bloom were
stricken by Mushroom Flu, known as MF. According to him, he has no
idea where it could have came from, but he suspects aliens. Citizens
of MK, watch out for aliens! Suspects include Tatanga, Shroobs,
Kirby...&quot; Mario stopped reading and looked up confusingly.</p>
<p>The Postmaster smiled. &quot;I know Mario, that was my reaction as
well! Completely idiotic, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; Mario muttered, taking another glance at the
headline, &quot;it didn't sound like they knew what they were talking
about...At all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right. Tomfoolery as well. I caught wind of people being
sick at the hospital but that's just crazy. These journalists really
think we'll believe anything, except Kylie of course.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Kylie...Koopa?&quot; Mario mused.</p>
<p>&quot;Right. You getting sick of me saying 'right'? Anyway, she's
the writer of the Koopa Kronicle, and a darn good one. That's the
only paper I trust now a days. So anyway, I'll have this sent out
right away. That all?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yeah. Thanks...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right. See you later, Mario!&quot;</p>
<p>Mario left and stood on the street corner, deliberating on his
next course of action. It was clear to him now that mass hysteria
wasn't about to spread just yet. Peach was wisely discreet with the
state of emergency warning, and horrible journalism had diluted any
sense of panic that could come from the surprisingly correct
assumption of Mushroom Flu, apparently revealed by MKDCU agent Jimmy
M., assuming he was that supposed &quot;rich entrepreneur president
of health&quot; person quoted in the paper, and Dr. Mario would have
the letter by tomorrow for sure. Considering the situation, things
we're going as well as they possibly could.</p>
<p>But wait, he thought. He still just need to get to Bowser before
Luigi! How would he pull that off, considering they would have
already gotten an hour head start on him? There were no shortcuts he
knew of that Luigi didn't, and his Sky Pop plane had been out of
service for ages. Mario would just have to hope Buckenberry could
slow them enough. He was just disheartened that he couldn't reveal to
him that he DID know of Dr. Mario's whereabouts. Mario had promised
to keep it a secret for the doctor, and Mario knew he couldn't afford
to break anymore promises.</p>
<p>Just then, Mario gasped as someone rounded the corner to met him.
&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; Mario asked.</p>
<p>The person beckoned him to follow them to a more secluded area.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>At the Mushroom Press, Jimmy continued to entertain the reporters
with stories of his past misadventures. After the coast was clear of
Richard and Wiggletron, he'd slipped back in. He couldn't let the
offer of free coffee go to waste!</p>
<p>&quot;-And I said to em 'he's red as the dickens! Just dunk the
guy in the cream', and they did! You haven't lived until you've seen
an 300 pound Toad jump in a giant tub of anti-itch cream!&quot;</p>
<p>The Toad next to him, Mitch, laughed harder. &quot;Aww man! This
is going into the Mushroom Enquirer next! Hear that, Kylie?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Kylie? The girl's been gone ages ago,&quot; the desk
receptionist said restlessly, putting some more hot water in the
coffee maker.</p>
<p>Mitch looked around a bit. &quot;Oh. Ah-hem, I knew that! Well
anyway, how long are you sticking around? I uh...&quot; Mitch
suddenly stopped and put some sunglasses on.</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; Jimmy asked.</p>
<p>&quot;You should probably go outside,&quot; Mitch said with sudden
seriousness.</p>
<p>Jimmy briefly glanced to the glass door to spot...a towing hook!
In a quick reflex, he sprinted to the exit and was greeted by
Sebastian and Parabilly on the sidewalk, both shooting daggers at
him.</p>
<p>&quot;Whoa! Stop!&quot; Jimmy yelled.</p>
<p>&quot;No can do sir,&quot; Lakitu said. He had the van secured
with a giant fishing hook to an oversized cloud. On the side of the
cloud, it was printed, &quot;Lakitu's Independent Towing Company&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Shouldn't you be fishing up go-carts or something?!&quot;
Jimmy screamed up to him.</p>
<p>&quot;Sucker, this is my day job. What else I'm gonna do? Not like
we'll be having any sports games any time soon by the looks of it.
See ya!&quot; The cloud began to float away with the van.</p>
<p>&quot;First the hospital, then the coppers, now the towing
companies?! I hate the Mushroom Kingdom!&quot; Jimmy yelled at one in
particular.</p>
<p>Sebastian crossed his arms. &quot;Ah-hem! What did you think was
going to happen?! I'm I still in Subcon? Because this a nightmare,
and I'm sooo tired!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Me too!&quot; Parabilly piped up as Lakitu took off, &quot;He
said this was the most illegalest parked car he ever done seen! All
I'll have you know that we're tired of it!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What? You twos gonna quit too?&quot; Jimmy asked harshly.</p>
<p>&quot;Well...maybe! Ain't that right?&quot; Parabilly asked,
turning to Sebastian.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh huh. Why did we make you leader anyway? Your actions have
just made everything worse. We could have been at the bottom of this
yesterday, and why aren't we finding a cure for their disease? Aren't
we the health experts?&quot;</p>
<p>Jimmy threw his hands up. &quot;We ARE! Do you really think you
can lead a disrespectful team while dealing with a deadly plague
better than me? Cause this is a severe violation of protocol and I
can fire you all right now!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then do it. There's only five dern dollars at stake!&quot;
Parabilly spat, making Sebastian look to him questionably. &quot;I
quit myself! I ain't learned nothing and we ain't done nothing. We
got em all locked up somewhere and we can't even help em. We might as
well have never showed up! I got a home, a family to feed, and real
job opportunities down home, and you can't keep me here any longer!&quot;</p>
<p>Sebastian gasped. &quot;Billy? You-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I already said It! That's it!&quot; Parabilly threw his
badge to the ground. &quot;I'm outta here!&quot;</p>
<p>Jimmy fumed. &quot;You know what? It don't matter, you're right!
We gotta get em to the Special World hospital but that's it. It's
done, and I don't need you all anymore anyway! Get outta here!&quot;</p>
<p>Parabilly wordlessly flew down the sidewalk and disappeared around
a corner. Jimmy turned around and went the opposite direction,
leaving Sebastian forlorn in front of the Mushroom Press entrance.</p>
<p><em>*tap tap*</em></p>
<p>He turned around so see someone peering through the glass door and
knocking. When their eyes met, the person motioned him to come
inside. He brought Sebastian to his office space and told him to take
a seat.</p>
<p>&quot;So you're Sebastian Bullet of Subcon, right?&quot; Mitch
asked.</p>
<p>Sebastian nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;I still got!&quot; Mitch said with a twinkle in his eye. &quot;By
the way, I'm Mitch T., writer of the Mushroom Enquirer, most famous
newspaper ever!&quot; He reached out to shake Sebastian's hand.
&quot;Okay, so you got towed by Lakitu. Right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh yeah?&quot; Sebastian responded.</p>
<p>Mitch leaned back in his comfy office chair and put his arms
behind his head. &quot;Great, well not for you I guess. Sorry I
didn't see it sooner.&quot; he said somewhat flippantly. &quot;I've
gotten so used to blocking it out now, but never mind. James was full
of crap anyway, you probably won't miss him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now that I can agree on!&quot; Sebastian said.</p>
<p>Mitch then leaded towards Sebastian. &quot;Listen, I put out a
nice fairytale for the paper but I know is really a big deal. I need
you to me what really happened,&quot; he whispered.</p>
<p>&quot;Well...&quot; Sebastian hesitated.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll pay ya!&quot; Mitch added.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure thing! And I have lots to tell.&quot; Sebastian started
from the beginning and Mitch wrote down his account studiously.
Sebastian felt better about getting fired now that he'd met Mitch,
though he still had an odd feeling about him.</p>
<p>Outside, less than five minutes later, Jimmy took a wrong turn,
being unacquainted with traveling on foot, and hit a dead end in a
dark alley.</p>
<p>&quot;Well this is just great. No van. No equipment. No agents. No
directions! No respect! The Mushroom Kingdom can kiss- what the?!&quot;</p>
<p><em>WhoooOOoooosh!</em></p>
<p>In the darkness, Jimmy saw a cloud of some sort stirring up in
front of him, coming up from the ground. He was about to turn back to
run when he was frozen in shock by a wicked laughter.</p>
<p>&quot;Hehehehehehehehehehehehe! Stop right there!&quot; someone
cackled. &quot;I've been looking for you!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry! P-please Eldstar, no!&quot; Jimmy bawled.</p>
<p>The cloud settled down to reveal a dark Boo, its face twisted in a
psychotic smile. &quot;Stop crying! Laugh, or else you fool! Hehehe!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A Boo?! W-what do ya want with ME?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I saw the whole thing in front of that Mushroom Press place,
hehe. You must feel sooo sad..&quot;</p>
<p>Jimmy didn't respond and continued to shake in fear and hold back
tears.</p>
<p>&quot;I said, LAUGH OR ELSE!&quot; the Dark Boo barked.</p>
<p>&quot;Ha ha ha ha haaaa!&quot; Jimmy cried.</p>
<p>&quot;That's better, hehe. They call me Z by the way. Let's have
some fun!&quot; Z moved closer. &quot;You hate the Mushroom Kingdom,
I hate the Mushroom Kingdom, we're a perfect match. Yaayy!&quot; Z
hugged Jimmy. &quot;Come with me, buddy!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hold on, now!&quot; Jimmy said, pushing Z away. &quot;I have
a job to do. I ain't no Boo Hunters candidate. What's the meaning of
this?&quot;</p>
<p>Z scowled at him briefly, flashing some sharp teeth in the
process, then went back to a smile. &quot;Aww, not scared anymore?
Well good, maybe we can talk, hehe. You are James Monty of the
MKDCU.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh huh? And?&quot; Jimmy crossed his arms, trying to seem
unafraid.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I'm only your biggest fan! We're both from Donut
Plains, and I've followed all of your medical journals. I've always
admired you more than the others and well,&quot; Z looked away
bashfully, &quot;I just really wanted to work with you. Please let me
help you!&quot; Z latched on to Jimmy again in a tighter hug.</p>
<p>&quot;Alright, alright! Uh, you can help, uh somehow!&quot; Jimmy
yelled, his voiced muffled by the bigger Boo's embrace.</p>
<p>&quot;Great,&quot; Z said flatly, &quot;but first I need you to
help me, hehe. Let's go on a little trip...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What? Let me go you- Ahhhhh!&quot;</p>
<p>A Purple cloud engulfed them as Jimmy screamed, unable to get out
to Z's grasp. His screams died down as the two disappeared into the
shadows...</p>
<p>On another street, Parabilly waited at a bus stop. He had already
phoned his relatives down in Southern Mushroom Kingdom. The 'city
folk' life and the stress that came with it wasn't for him after all,
he had resolved. He'd be better off as the local prairie physician
like he always was. Soon the bus pulled up and he hopped on. He was
heading out of Toad Town, possibly forever...</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>Toadsworth knocked on Peach's door. After a moment it opened,
revealing Toadette, who was wearing an apron and holding a feather
duster.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Toadsworth? What's wrong?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Princess? Wait, what were you doing in here?&quot; Toadworth
asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh...I was just cleaning.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And why, young lady? Where could she be? She isn't OUT is
she?&quot; he asked harshly.</p>
<p>Toadette was about to remind him that she was authorized to clean
Peach's room when ever she felt, but she kelp silent. When Luigi
texted Peach an hour ago that Mario was put out of the mission, Peach
immediately made plans to meet him. She had some unresolved feelings
about Bowser's message and wanted to speak to Mario about it and told
her to to keep Toadsworth at bay in the meantime. Still, she didn't
feel good about lying to the oldest and loyalist servant in the
castle...</p>
<p>&quot;Is she out?!&quot; Toadsworth repeated. &quot;Answer me!
This is no time for childish games!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Umm, so why do you think she's out, Mr. Toadsworth?&quot;
Deflection, maybe that would work, she thought.</p>
<p>&quot;I have been all over our dear castle, except for her room of
course, which brings me here. Is she inside?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you need, sir?&quot;</p>
<p>Toadsworth pouted. &quot;I need to speak with her about a private
matter. You are a higher level servant and I appreciate your hard
work, I really do. I am sorry, my dear, for yelling so much. These
are just dreadful and stressful times, you understand?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, sir?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed! What I have to say involves her safety. You know,
with secret agents of Bowser running amok and whatnot.&quot;</p>
<p>Toadette shook her head. &quot;I understand, but you can't come
in!&quot; Toadsworth looked to her surprisingly. &quot;-Because...she
isn't dressed! And..she's in the bath!&quot; So much for not lying,
Toadette thought. &quot;Besides, the water was taking a while to heat
up, but if you must tell her something now, you could just tell me.&quot;
Toadette smiled sweetly which mollified Toadsworth further.</p>
<p>&quot;Hmm...Thank you dear, but I will just come back at a more
appropriate time.&quot; Toadsworth smiled. &quot;Good day for now,
Toadette.&quot;</p>
<p>Toadsworth walked back down the stairs, relieving but also
disappointing Toadette who was very curious about that info. She
retreated back inside the room and collapsed on Peach's bed, letting
out a deep breath. Now she'd just need to keep this charade up for
the entire day!</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>The Mushroom Bus stopped at the Peach's Castle stop. This bus stop
was usually used for castle tours or employees but the locals also
used it to get to the the lake near Peach's castle or the private
racetrack. A group of fifteen or so people exited, including Jelectro
Bond, Kylie, Dick and Wiggletron. There was now only a short walk to
the castle up a sandy rural path.</p>
<p>&quot;Have y'all ever visited this place before?&quot; Dick asked,
breaking the silence that been between the four since getting on the
bus.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, as an young child,&quot; Wiggletron answered. &quot;Have
heard that it has not been redecorated since.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well I haven't been inside but I've heard it's drab. You
know, empty rooms with only giant paintings in them and a flooded
basement and an endless staircase?&quot;</p>
<p>Kylie, who was leading the way, suppressed a laugh. &quot;Who told
you that? Super Mario 64?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Umm, yeah? You're trying to tell me that game isn't
accurate? What ever...&quot; Dick looked to Bond. &quot;Hey Bond? You
alive?&quot;</p>
<p>Bond mumbled something and walked along in the rear, deep in
thought.</p>
<p>Kylie glanced back his way and then looked ahead again quickly.
&quot;Stay focused, brother. The game plan is this, when we get
there, let me do the talkin'. First, we tell them a little of what we
know. Make them think we know a lot, okay? Then we get them to tell
us what they know. Easy as pie.. or cake considering where we are.
Think Peach ever made pies?&quot;</p>
<p>Dick rolled his eyes. &quot;You must be hungry, girl. Anyway, I
thought you and Bond knew everything by now!&quot;</p>
<p>Kylie took a quick glance at her phone. &quot;Yeah and no. It came
up on my phone that Peach has put the kingdom in a state of
emergency-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What is that?&quot;</p>
<p>Kylie pouted. &quot;You don't know?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are not natives to the Mushroom Kingdom,&quot; Wiggs
reminded her.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yeah. Sorry bout that, brother,&quot; Kylie said
apologetically. &quot;Peach does that when there's trouble. Back in
the day, this would put everyone's lives on hold until we knew we
were safe. I would know, I've time traveled. Now? Pffft! So since she
has the emergency out, Mario and the rest must know on some level
that trouble's a brewin'. But we still don't know a few key points,
okay?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What would those points be?&quot; Wiggs asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Well my main one is why Bowser would think he could get away
with this. I know he can be more shortsighted than a Bob-omb with a
one inch fuse with his plans, but this is so obvious it's stupid!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh of course you meant that!&quot; Dick said, thinking he
was sounding smart. &quot;Yeah, that must be why he was helping Mario
earlier at the hospital. You know, be all involved so you can claim
it couldn't be-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?!&quot; Kylie gasped. &quot;Bowser was helping Mario?
When?&quot; She stopped and turned around to face the rest.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes! When?&quot; Bond piped up from behind Dick and
Wiggletron. He joined Kylie standing in front of them. Dick gave them
a confused look.</p>
<p>&quot;That was yesterday? I thought I told ya? He was confused and
junk and he was there when Toad and Daisy when wild. Mario dropped to
the floor and he was all about to cry in stuff-'</p>
<p>&quot;Agent Richard and Wiggletron,&quot; Bond said sternly, &quot;this
changes everything!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I should have mentioned it also,&quot; Wiggs said, avoiding
their gaze. &quot;I apologize as well. The over abundance of new
information we have acquired along with the frequent separation of
our team has made it difficult to remember who possesses what
knowledge...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh..okay? Well, that's why you record everything in a
notebook!&quot; Kylie groaned, scribbling a few more notes down.
&quot;Well it's game time now 'cause here's the guard. Everyone stay
quiet like I said.&quot;</p>
<p>They approached the front castle guard. He was a teenaged red
capped toad holding a spear under his arm playing a Nintendo DS.
&quot;Halt! All tours are prohibited in times of emergency!&quot; he
said in a rehearsed fashion without looking away from the game.</p>
<p>&quot;We aren't here for tours, friend. We are umm, the plumbers
that were called!&quot; Kylie said. Even she wondered where she got
that excuse from, she had a feeling she had heard it before
somewhere...</p>
<p>The guard closed the DS and stared for a moment. &quot;Oh, like
Mario or something?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah. Just like em. We need to fix that leak!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You know, that leak y'all have? We need to fix it. Right
guys?&quot; She pointed back to the rest with her thumb.</p>
<p>&quot;Where is Princess Peach?&quot; Bond asked, not bothering
playing along. Kylie shot him an annoyed look.</p>
<p>The guard shrugged. &quot;Inside I guess. Look, as long as you
guys aren't Bowser, you can come in or whatever. I really don't
care.&quot; He pulled the door open for them and went back to his
game.</p>
<p>&quot;Perfect, young man. Thank you,&quot; Bond said genially.
When everyone entered, they were then in the castle main room and
mezzanine, an open checkerboard tiled area that connected to all of
the parts of the castle. The decor was pretty, with lots of flowers
and glass ornaments but there was also a lot of dust and dirt pulled
up, making the place look slightly unkempt.</p>
<p>&quot;Welcome to the castle- wait. Aren't visitations over?&quot;
A purple capped Toad standing at a podium asked them.</p>
<p>&quot;Where is Peach, mon ami?&quot; Bond asked.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't tell you exactly but she's definitely home. We can't
have her running around with Bowser's secret agents spreading the
Mushroom Flu!&quot;</p>
<p>Everyone looked to the worker surprisingly. Kylie also wrote
something in her notebook.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you at least have an idea?&quot; Bond asked hurriedly.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry, who are you?&quot; The Toad asked with sudden
suspicion.</p>
<p>&quot;...Plumbers.&quot;</p>
<p>The toad smiled instantly. &quot;I'm so sorry, hon! Plumbers are
always welcome here! Just go on up the stairs when you get to the
room behind me. If anyone asks who you guys are, just tell them that,
okay? Have a wonderful day!&quot;</p>
<p>They went to another room that had stairways going up and down and
halls leading to other ground level portions of the castle. The room
was deserted of anyone except for a Toad that was vacuuming the
carpet while wearing headphones. Said Toad glanced their way exactly
once and then proceeded to ignore their presence.</p>
<p>Bond turned around to face everyone. &quot;A little lonely here,
is it not? Okay mes amies, I have appreciated all of your efforts
until this point, but now that we all have the same knowledge, it is
not necessarily for all of us to be present when we meet the
Princess. It might look suspicious if we are all here and do no
plumbing work at all, so-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I see,&quot; Kylie said, glancing towards the ex-MKDCU
agents. &quot;Why don't you two wander around and find something to
fix?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ugh, seriously?&quot; Dick whined. &quot;You mean like the
flooded basement?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Again, the basement isn't- never mind... y'all keep busy
okay?&quot; Kylie took sides next to Bond, who was also looking to
them expectantly. It irritated Dick when they used their &quot;team
power&quot; against him and Wiggs, like they were their employers or
something, he thought. Well actually...</p>
<p>&quot;Sure,&quot; Wiggs said, pulling Dick closer to him, which
made Dick look to him indignantly, &quot;I would like to explore
anyway so as to discover what has or has not changed since my
childhood visit. You can count on us to assist you in your operation,
right Richard?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wiggs, lay off! Okay whatever. We'll give you love bugs some
privacy, alright?&quot;</p>
<p>Kylie did her signature finger snap. &quot;Great brother, we'll
just-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hold up 'sis', I'm not done. Bond said he appreciated us and
junk, and we have done a lot for you two, so I say we make it clear
that we expect compensation! We are for hire agents remember?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What? Y'all want pay?!&quot; Kylie put her hands on her
hips. &quot;Is the experience of true justice in action not en-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;-No,&quot; Dick interrupted.</p>
<p>&quot;I uh, agree to Richard's preposition,&quot; Wiggs added
bashfully.</p>
<p>&quot;Hold on,&quot; Bond muttered while digging in his wallet. He
pulled out a couple of American hundred dollar bills worth 10,000
coins each and handed them out to Dick and Wiggs. &quot;You are
right, how could I have been so stingy before? Help yourself, mes
amies!&quot;</p>
<p>Dick jumped up and down like an excited little girl. Wiggs gawked
at the amount of cash in his hand, the most he'd ever held at once
actually. Kylie was surprised and jealous and babbled about how they
hadn't really done much. Bond just stood back amusingly.</p>
<p>&quot;Let us go,&quot; Bond said finally, grabbing Kylie's arm to
lead her away. After Kylie could finally pry her eyes away from their
cash, they made way upstairs. They were silent as they went up the
steps, but Kyle noticed that Bond seemed to be in a particularly good
mood now.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, what are you so jolly about?&quot; Kylie asked.</p>
<p>&quot;The joy of giving!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;For real though, what is it?&quot; Kylie asked seriously.</p>
<p>&quot;Ha. Clever as always. Actually it was previous events. You
see, you used my idea!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What? The- oh! That's where I got the plumber thing from?
Yeah that was gonna be our disguise at Bowser's place at first. We
discussed that in your car or something, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Something like that, but I am glad you bought it up. I would
not have remembered it otherwise. Excellent work from you as usual.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yeah, thanks.&quot; Kylie said, trying not to smile.</p>
<p>&quot;What is our plan exactly? Your idea that they know something
we don't was correct. I suspect Bowser sent them a message.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I guess so. Secret agents? That sounds like fear mongering.
It's all because of stale soda, for pete's sake. Don't eat stale
food!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't underestimate the power of nostalgia, mon ami.&quot;</p>
<p>Kylie looked to him solemnly. &quot;Right...So I'm sorry too about
last night. I blew up on you like twenty-five Bulky Bob-ombs and I
shouldn't have. I've just been having a hard time.&quot;</p>
<p>Bond shrugged. &quot;It's okay. This is a dire situation, after
all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No not that.&quot; Kylie stopped on one of the steps. &quot;It
was because of you. Well, not you. I really do like you. It was
just...your abilities...&quot;</p>
<p>Bond's head sunk. &quot;Ah. I see...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I guess I should explain. Back when I was new on the
reporter scene, I dated this Toad guy who was a fellow reporter. His
name was Mitch. He was real nice and stuff and he had powers similar
to you which I thought was cool at the time. Well..after a while I
realized he was stealing my scoops for the Mushroom Enquirer and was
just a jerk overall. Worst thing is, I still have to work with him!
Again, I'm sorry. It really wasn't personal but when you told me
about yourself last night, it all came back to me...&quot; Kylie said
sadly.</p>
<p>&quot;Mon ami,&quot; Bond said, grabbing her shoulder, &quot;I am
very sorry you had to contend with someone who would abuse their
power like that. You say you still work with him? Was he not
reported?&quot;</p>
<p>Kylie groaned. &quot;Yeah actually, but it's hard to provide
evidence of mind invasion! Whatever though, he realized that his
paper could get way more sales if he ignored the truth all together
and published exaggerated bogus garbage that people eat up. Trust me,
he's not really a threat anymore. Just a pain in the neck at worse.&quot;</p>
<p>Bond paused thoughtfully as the ascended the steps again. &quot;Would
you please give me another chance, mon ami!&quot; he finally plead.
&quot;You know I'd never invade your mind...At least not on
purpose...&quot; Kylie gave him a weird glance, seemingly
understanding what he meant by that, and causing Bond to look away
awkwardly. &quot;You were on my mind...Literally. I mean, you know
what I mean. Listen, I am decommissioning myself after this ordeal
and incidents like that will never happen ag-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;-You are? Why?&quot; Kylie demanded.</p>
<p>Bond looked back her way, surprisingly. &quot;Because it isn't
allowed according to Super Spy HQ. I mean, I theoretically could if I
behaved normal but I clearly can't.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't say that, Bond,&quot; she plead as they made it to
Peach's room. They stopped outside the door.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Bond asked.</p>
<p>Kylie crossed her arms. &quot;I mean, don't let silly ol me and my
personal issues take that away from you. We don't do the same bring,
but we both work for truth and justice, don't we? I wanted your help
in the first place because I knew you were the best of the best. The
top dog! And you mean to imply that you could keep this under control
then but not now? What's really the issue, Bond?&quot;</p>
<p>Bond took a deep breath as Kyle stared him down.</p>
<p>&quot;-And don't even think about lying to me, Bond. I might not
have your gift but I know a fib when I see one!&quot; Kylie said
jokingly, trying to lighten the mood. Bond chuckled slightly, then
took off his glasses to look her in the face. Kylie was once more
surprised and at his unusual eyes and found herself gazing back with
the same intensity.</p>
<p>&quot;Kylie,&quot; Bond said softly, &quot;you are aware that our
abilities may be affected by our emotions, correct?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh huh...&quot; Kylie mumbled.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I guess there is no other way to say this.&quot; Bond
grabbed her hand. &quot;Kylie Koopa, I l-&quot;</p>
<p>The door to Peach's room opened, revealing Toadette who was
holding some dishes. &quot;Who are you guys?&quot; she gasped. Bond
threw his glasses back on and Kylie snapped out of it. They both
froze up for a moment.</p>
<p>&quot;Well? I'm calling security!&quot; Toadette warned, putting
down the dishes and grabbing her radio.</p>
<p>&quot;We're plumbers!&quot; Kylie and Bond blurted out.</p>
<p>Toadette let out a deep breath. &quot;Oh why didn't you say
so!...Wait, dang!&quot; Toadette stepped forward and closed the door
behind her. &quot;I'm Toadette by the way. Did Mr. Toadsworth send
you guys up here because I said something about the water taking a
while to heat up? I shot myself in the foot with that excuse,&quot;
she huffed.</p>
<p>&quot;So is there a problem then?&quot; Bond asked.</p>
<p>&quot;No. I just needed to get him away. The bathroom is fine,
sorry you guys had to go up all of these steps for nothing,&quot;
Toadette said sympathetically.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh the trip was no issue,&quot; Bond assured her.</p>
<p>&quot;Hmm. Really now? Because there's like a thousand steps from
top to bottom, and I know you plumbers don't get paid much to deal
with this. I'm kind of tight with the Marios you see. Who are you
guys anyway? The Noki Bros?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm a girl, sister,&quot; Kylie said, mildly offended.</p>
<p>Toadette flushed in embarrassment. &quot;Oh I knew that. I guess I
was just thinking about like, Smash Bros or something. You know, they
have female fighters too. I mean, never mind...&quot; There was an
aura of awkwardness in the hallway after she said that.</p>
<p>&quot;..So can we speak to Peach, Toadette?&quot; Bond asked.</p>
<p>&quot;No. She's away- but not OUT! Don't tell Mr. Toadsworth I
said that!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You mean she is not here at all?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's not what I said! I just can't bring her to you, okay?
Bye!&quot; Toadette put her hand on the doorknob, ready to retreat.</p>
<p>&quot;Toadette, wait, mon ami. We are not really plumbers, I'm
Jelectro Bond, a secret agent and this is Kylie Koopa, a reporter,
and we have very important information that the Princess needs to
hear. We have been on the case since yesterday and I assure you we
know more about what's going on that anything you heard so far.&quot;
Bond spoke quickly in his signature low but authoritative voice.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Toadette was immune, frowning at them both. &quot;Excuse
me? Our Kingdom is at stake and we are at war! Prove to me that you
really know what you're talking about. And yes, I'm aware of that
stupid story The Mushroom Enquirer put out earlier today. If you even
bring that nonsense up, I'm calling security immediately!&quot;
Toadette spoke authoritatively as well. Bond immediately thought
about how she should have been the one guarding the front doors.</p>
<p>Kylie fumed. The moment Toadette had mentioned the Mushroom
Enquirer, she blocked out the rest and got red hot. &quot;So Mitch
really did it! He put out a half baked-baloney-sorry excuse for a-no
journalistic integrity-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's wrong with her?&quot; Toadette snapped.</p>
<p>&quot;Never mind. Just listen to me. Here is the proof. The
Mushroom King is now showing symptoms of Mushroom Flu. You can prove
this by checking with MK East hospital. Emery T., the rooftop ems can
verify everything. What else do you need to know before we can see
the Princess?&quot; Bond asked impatiently.</p>
<p>Toadette went pale and speechless for a moment. &quot;HOW?-&quot;
she finally gasped.</p>
<p>&quot;The secret is FungusUp, mon ami!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bowser used that? But he said he used air pollutants and-
well that message was confidential but-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We need to see that message! That's the only way we can
solve the missing pieces. Is Peach here or not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, she's gone to see Mario!&quot; Toadette admitted. &quot;And
our King is sick too? I hate Bowser so much!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe Bowser ain't totally in hot water,&quot; Kylie said,
recovering herself, &quot;he was helping Mario all the way last
night. Now show us this message!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know Bowser WAS helping Mario but, I can't show the
video...it was a onetime broadcast but I can describe it in full I
guess. In fact, I might never forget it..&quot; Bond and Kylie, who
were growing impatient with her until that point, toned things down.</p>
<p>&quot;Take your time, mon ami,&quot; Bond said softly. Kylie
nodded and got her notebook ready.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay,&quot; Toadette muttered, holding back tears, &quot;this
is a safe place by the way. Trust me, no one else is up here.&quot;
She related the video to the best of her ability, mentioning the Dark
Boo messenger, what Bowser said and how Mario and rest went on to
fight Bowser only for Mario to apparently get kicked off the team.
She also mentioned that Peach had secretly left to find Mario. Kylie
put her pen down and reread her notes, Bond seemed to be thinking
about the recount.</p>
<p>&quot;Hmm. A clone. No.. coercion ..&quot; Bond spoke to himself.</p>
<p>Kylie thought of something as well. &quot;And you say Bowser's
message seemed fishy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well they said it was kind of stilted and just off in
general. I guess we were so distracted by the fact that he was
threatening to change all of our lives forever that we forgot about
his weird delivery. Why?&quot;</p>
<p>Bond clasped his hands, pleased. &quot;Mon ami? It's all figured
out! We have cracked the case, of at least the main parts of it!&quot;
Kylie and Toadette gawked. &quot;Bowser did not do it. In fact, he is
completely innocent likely. Someone has forced him to threaten the
Kingdom and throw in a red herring with the method of infection. The
whole point is to move the kingdom to immediate war, and the
targeting of close friends along with innocents with a virus is to
sever any chance of a peaceful relationship afterwards.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah ha!&quot; Kylie said triumphantly. &quot;That's probably
why they intentionally used a disease that everyone knows could only
come from Bowser's castle. It was always meant to lead to Bowser..&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sharp as always, Kylie.&quot; Bond smiled. &quot;Still I
wonder where the MKDCU come into the picture. We know that they were
called to the hospital, but not who called them exactly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, me too. Hmm. Their meddling is the only reason why
word of MF got out. Obviously MK East was wholly unequipped with mad
doctors and all. Why would anyone call em unless they were in on the
scheme?...Unless someone was sabotaging it! Now that I think about
it, I wouldn't have showed up if not for the crowd they caused.&quot;</p>
<p>Bond nodded. &quot;Still, those are secondary points. We know what
we have to do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; Toadette asked. &quot;If there something Peach
needs to know, I can contact her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tell her to warn citizens of drink any FungusUp, and instead
turn them in at the the Toadley Clinic, NOT the MK East hospital or
here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why not here? MK East is Peach's official hospital and our
infirmary here is great too!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A cohort to Bowser's conspirers is still at MK East. The
other must have been the doctor that jumped out of the window, and I
don't want dangerous cans of FungusUp anywhere near this castle. Now,
you need to tell her this, Bowser isn't to blame, and there are no
air pollutants, but his threat still stands.&quot;</p>
<p>Toadette, still overwhelmed by the information they were spewing,
gave him a worried look. &quot;What do you mean? Even after that,
we'd still be in danger?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. You can bet that after today something will certainly
happen, even if Bowser is not the one to do it. Mario, or Luigi I
mean, and his group DO need to reach Bowser today, but they need to
take out exactly who is the cause of this. We can't know their exact
mindset, but it has to be those in high ranking league with him. Then
of course, there the matter of getting in contact with Dr. Mario
before those currently sick go off the deep end...&quot; Bond's voice
got quieter as the gravity of the situation sunk in.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll get on it, Eldstar be with you guys,&quot; Toadette
said determinedly, pickup up her dish and retreating inside Peach's
room again.</p>
<p>Kylie turned to Bond. &quot;Zoinks! The truth is out! Guess our
part in this skirmish is over?&quot;</p>
<p>Bond turned to her regrettably. &quot;I am afraid so, mon ami. We
are just the justice seekers, not the justice enforcers. It is in the
hands of Mario and the rest now that they know the truth, or at least
enough truth.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, and I gotta get on the scoop of the century back at
the press. I suppose it's early on the draw, but after the
journalistic garbage Mitch put out, I'd better counter it with the
light of justice, ya know?&quot; Bond laughed out loud at Kylie's
eagerness, his baritone voice echoing slightly in the hallway. Kylie
started to giggle too. &quot;We have no business being this giddy.
The show ain't over yet! Guess we'd better round up those other two.
By the way, where we going for our next date?&quot; She noticed
Bond's look. &quot;Yeah I know what you were gonna say, it don't take
a psych to know when a guy likes ya!&quot;</p>
<p>Bond flushed. &quot;So it is a date then, my lovely Kylie!&quot;</p>
<p>Inside of Peach's room, Toadette texted Peach with shaky hands.
Explaining the whole deal went past the maximum amount of characters
per text so in the end she sent off five or six. Bond and Kylie's
revelation made her feel better and worse in ways. Before at least,
she had a single person to blame and hate. Even through her sadness
and anger, she could feel like she did know what was going on. Now
though, she didn't know what was really happening. Who exactly
coerced Bowser? Did they now have to deal with an even bigger
villain?</p>
<p>Only one thing could comfort her now. She opened her messenger and
scrolled through the contacts.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>Luigi, Boo, Yoshi, Buckenberry, and Alagold stopped at a Water
Land Toad House to check the map again. It was empty, surprising no
one, but they found a mushroom left behind to add to their inventory.
There were now six mushrooms, three fire flowers, one cape feather,
two Tanooki suits, and one starman in their arsenal.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Alagold clicked on a YouTube video called &quot;Mario is
a sociopath&quot;. First there was an advertisement with a scene at a
park. A hipster looking Yoshi wearing a scarf and holding a cell
phone addressed the camera. &quot;<em>Can you hear me now? Oh right,
with your phone plan you don't have the range that YoshiMobile has.
You could be getting full coverage in all of the Mushroom Kingdom for
twenty percent less than those other guys!&quot;</em></p>
<p>&quot;Yeah right,&quot; Alagold mumbled, furiously tapping the
&quot;skip ad&quot; prompt that was still counting down. &quot;I
should have installed that ad block!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Alagold, stop!&quot; Luigi said sternly, looking up briefly
from the map he had pulled out .</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Boo, who was just standing around, added,
&quot;content creators need that ad revenue!&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi shook his head. &quot;Actually I meant that just because
Bowser didn't capture any fortresses, it doesn't mean we can have our
guard down. Bowser could have deployed soliders, or worse, secret
agents to stop us.&quot; Saying it out loud sent shivers down Luigi's
spine. That, and the fact that this was his first hero mission
without Mario in a long time.</p>
<p>&quot;Right, gotta stay focused! Got ya Weegee! ...Hmm, wonder
when I should drink this fungus up?&quot; Boo pulled it out of the
bag.</p>
<p>&quot;Gross. Never liked that crap, stale or not...&quot;
Buckenberry said, looking out of the window in boredom.</p>
<p>&quot;Different strokes,&quot; Alagold teased. &quot;When will you
learn that?&quot;</p>
<p>Buckenberry looked to him and rolled his eyes, incidentally
catching a peek of what Alagold was trying to look up. The video
title made him gasp, &quot;How dare you, Gold!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What? I know that's a stupid game theory but I'm so bored!
We haven't fought anything yet and we'd been walking for almost an
hour!&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi shot Alagold another glance, which made him finally put the
phone away. Buckenberry noticed that Yoshi was extremely quiet off in
the corner of the house.</p>
<p>&quot;You okay?&quot; Buckenberry whispered.</p>
<p>Yoshi nodded silently. Just then Buckenberry felt his phone
vibrate.</p>
<p>&quot;Umm, I have to go to the bathroom. That okay?&quot;
Buckenberry asked.</p>
<p>Luigi looked to him disappointedly. &quot;Have we not forgotten
that we're on short time? Hey, where are you-&quot;</p>
<p>Buckenberry entered the stall quickly and checked the message.</p>
<p>Toadette texted, &quot;<em>Hey baby. How r u?&quot;</em></p>
<p>Buckenberry replied, &quot;Okay. We've made some progress. Is it
better at the castle?&quot;</p>
<p><em>&quot;Not really. I've just got news from a spy and
journalist.&quot;</em></p>
<p>&quot;?&quot; Buckenberry would have added an emoji, but he wasn't
hip enough to know which one to use.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Uh huh. They say Bowser is innocent. *crazy emoji* I
think we can trust them tho. They know that our King is with MF too
now!&quot;</em></p>
<p>Buckenberry almost dropped his phone in shock. His sweaty hands
from Water Land's humid sticky weather weren't helping. &quot;!&quot;
He managed to text.</p>
<p>She replied, <em>&quot;Yea. I know.&quot;</em></p>
<p>&quot;Toadette. Right after Mario was kicked off the team, I spoke
to him and he had a theory like that.&quot;</p>
<p><em>&quot;Really? Get this. you do need to get to Bowser still.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Buckenberry debated. Should he let his girlfriend in on the
secret? Wouldn't hurt. &quot;Toadette, Mario told me to stall our
team. He said he needed to get to Bowser before us!&quot;</p>
<p>After a moment, she replied, <em>&quot;Peach went out to talk to
Mario! She was doubting something too. Guess what MF comes from?&quot;</em></p>
<p><strong>Knock knock knock! </strong><em>Splash</em><strong>!</strong></p>
<p>There was a loud rap on the door, making Buckenberry actually drop
his phone this time, and in the toilet!</p>
<p>&quot;AAAHH WHAT?&quot; Buckenberry screamed. &quot;My brand new
on contract phone from MushroomWireless!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's wrong? Did you fall in?&quot; Luigi asked from
outside the door.</p>
<p>Buckenberry dunked his hand into the tank to retrieve his phone.</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; Luigi repeated.</p>
<p>Buckenberry kicked the doors open, narrowing missing Luigi. &quot;I
dropped it in the toilet!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you say that I'm on the phone too much!&quot; Alagold,
who was also standing near the stall, mocked. Buckenberry shoved him
hard and he fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Luigi immediately stepped in between them and he had to pull the
Toads away from each other. &quot;Stop this right now! Blue, you can
get another phone later!&quot;</p>
<p>Buckenberry stopped trying to strangle Alagold but was still
seething. So much in fact, that he'd practically forgotten Toadette's
message. What was it? Something about needing to still get Bowser?
Close enough, he thought.</p>
<p>&quot;On the plus side guys, we found a warp pipe that will skip a
world!&quot; Boo said excitedly.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh no!&quot; Buckenberry exclaimed. &quot;...I mean okay,
but where is that FungusUp?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I thought it was gross to you,&quot; Alagold teased, this
time cautiously standing behind Luigi.</p>
<p>&quot;Shut up! Where is it? I need to see it!&quot; Buckenberry
demanded.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay okay, here it is?&quot; Boo pulled it back out of the
paper bag. Buckenberry snatched it quickly.</p>
<p>&quot;What's with you all of a sudden, Blue?&quot; Luigi asked,
approaching him again. &quot;We need to move on, not fight over
phones and soda!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I need a drink, okay? I'll even drink this garbage.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I found it!&quot; Boo moaned, reaching for it back.</p>
<p>Buckenberry hid it behind his back. &quot;But-&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi suddenly snatched it from Buckenberry. &quot;I will just
hang on to it. Okay? Any further objections? And I don't want another
outburst from you, Blue. I don't want to have to dismiss you too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...Whatever,&quot; Buckenberry muttered.</p>
<p>&quot;No need to be so angry,&quot; Luigi said delicately, &quot;It'll
all be over soon. Let's just work together this time. Okay?&quot;</p>
<p>Everyone got silent. Luigi shook his head as he lead them to the
pipe. Buckenberry followed as well, with his head sunk low,
disappointed at himself yet again.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>Dick and Wiggletron were in the torch lit basement. The downstairs
area of Peach's Castle was just storage area and sleeping quarters,
and the two had toured the whole little area in just a few minutes.</p>
<p>Dick yawned as Wiggs turned to him. &quot;Well it is just as musty
and banal as I remember. Let us explore on the ground level-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Halt!&quot; a Toad said to them as they rounded the corner
leading to the stairs. &quot;State your authorization!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay 'pipsqueak the second'. We're plumbers and stuff. In
fact, we were just leaving..&quot; Dick said insultingly, but without
passion. He felt like he might fall over sleep any moment.</p>
<p>The Toad crossed his arms and continued to block the stairway
&quot;Plumbers? Name please?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Richard. Call me Dick. And my friend here is Wiggs. Now let
us up the stairs, or will I have to walk over you?!&quot;</p>
<p>The Toad, ignoring the threat, pulled out a radio. &quot;I'm going
to need to verify your name and occupation for security reasons. Hold
on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, you hold on to your face!&quot; Dick charged forward,
only to be pulled back by Wiggletron.</p>
<p>&quot;Security!&quot; the Toad screeched.</p>
<p>&quot;What is the meaning of this?&quot; A British voice called
from upstairs. After the sound of a few more footsteps, Toadsworth
appeared.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Toadsworth, these suspicious people are down here and
they attacked me!&quot; The Toad said, pointing to Dick and Wiggs.</p>
<p>Toadsworth raised his hand to to silence the servant. &quot;This
is just a big misunderstanding. These must be the plumbers that were
sent here, right boys?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right, Mr. Old Toad Person. We were just fixing your moldy
old pipes!&quot; Dick said, winking to Wiggs.</p>
<p>&quot;What? You called plumbers?&quot; The servant asked in
disbelief.</p>
<p>&quot;Actually, I thought someone else called them! That is what
the servant stationed at the podium told me..&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, Mr. Toadsworth. If you didn't do it, no one has that I
know of. We've had no outcalls on our castle's phone line.&quot; When
he said this, he and Toadsworth looked back to Dick and Wiggs
suspiciously.</p>
<p>&quot;-That is because the call was made from a cellular
telephone,&quot; Wiggs spoke up, &quot;but I can assure you that we
were called and did not enter the castle under our own intuition or
anything!&quot; Dick looked to him with an expression like, 'you've
just saved our tails'.</p>
<p>Toadsworth had a hearty laugh. &quot;Of course! I always forget
about those newfangled doohickeys! Carry on gentlemen!&quot;</p>
<p>Toadsworth went back upstairs, making the Toad scoff. Dick smirked
and lead the way upstairs, purposely brushing past the annoyed Toad
and Wiggs waved in a friendly gesture.</p>
<p>Upstairs, it was still empty looking but they saw Bond and Kylie
talking in an obviously romantic way on the freshly vacuumed carpet.</p>
<p>&quot;Wow, I'm so surprised you two are dating at just one day!&quot;
Dick greeted them sarcasticly. Kylie and Bond turned to them.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, you're back...well how long have you known Wiggs,
brother?&quot; Kylie asked defensively.</p>
<p>Dick thought for a moment. &quot;A month. Why?&quot;</p>
<p>Wiggletron suddenly had a fit of laughter. &quot;Ha ha ha! You are
under the assumption that we are-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;-Business partners! Are you not?&quot; Bond asked.</p>
<p>Wiggs flushed. &quot;Uh, no?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What is going on?&quot; Dick asked, confused.</p>
<p>Bond leaned in to whisper to Wiggs. &quot;You know what I mean,
mon ami...&quot; he leaned back. &quot;Anyway, we can leave now. Our
mission is over, everyone is paid, the proper authorities know the
situation-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you have a hot date now, yeah yeah,&quot; Dick
interrupted. &quot;So it's time to finally split? Well at least we
got our highest pay ever. What now?&quot; He turned to Wiggs. &quot;Buy
one of those new Mercedes-Benzs that everyone has now? Hang out with
'Munchie'? I mean that Yoshi guy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am not sure about that last option, Richard,&quot; Bond
added amusingly, &quot;Yoshi is off with the Marios to fight Bowser.
Or one of them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bond is talkin about that green guy...what's his name
again?&quot; Kylie pondered for a moment.</p>
<p>&quot;Luigi Mario?&quot; Wiggs answered.</p>
<p>&quot;Ooooh him?!&quot; Dick exclaimed. &quot;Mr. Green leading
the assault against Bowser? Anything really can happen in the
Mushroom Kingdom!&quot;</p>
<p>Bond glanced at his Rolex Submariner. &quot;Look at that! Lunch
time already?&quot; He looked to Kylie slyly will Dick rolled his
eyes. &quot;Let's bail.&quot;</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p><strong>At Bowser Castle</strong></p>
<p>Kamek ran around Bowser's private quarters, relentlessly opening
every dusty file cabinet and going through every file of Bowser's
that no one had went through in years. After two knocks on the door,
Ludwig and Iggy stepped in the room to find a massive mess.</p>
<p>&quot;Gramps! Whatareya doing making this mess?&quot; Iggy asked.
&quot;We don't have a maid anymore, remember?&quot;</p>
<p>Kamek grunted without pausing.</p>
<p>&quot;It's alright gramps, really!&quot; Iggy said quickly, about
to approach before Ludwig stopped him.</p>
<p>&quot;Iggy. Let Kamek continue, we can tell him our news while he
works. Ah hem!&quot; Ludwig paused to retrieve a note from one of his
jacket pockets. &quot;As you know, Prince Bowser Junior's location is
unknown, and we also know he spoke with Father before leaving. This
being the case, we sent an agent specifically for him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, our secret agents?!&quot; Kamek exclaimed, still
completely occupied in his file searching. &quot;Which one of you
useless brats chased after him?&quot;</p>
<p>Ludwig hesitated, thinking about his next choice of words too
deeply to even notice the insult. Iggy spoke up.</p>
<p>&quot;We sent Z after him. Don't worry, Z won a track in field
race in high school of something and will definitely catch up to-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You WHAT?!&quot; Kamek screamed, tossing a few papers up in
the air at his disturbance.</p>
<p>Ludwig covered his face. &quot;I was GETTING to that! Yes, we have
ally from out side of our dynasty assisting us for-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;-Who is it? Z what? Who did you tell?!&quot; Kamek asked,
startling both Koopa princes.</p>
<p>&quot;Just 'Z', gramps!&quot; Iggy cried. &quot;You know, Z the
Dark Boo garbage collector?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But why, you idiots?!&quot; Kamek marched up to them in a
conniption. &quot;Don't you know what will happen if others know of
our plans?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because,&quot; Ludwig quickly interjected, &quot;Z got in on
our plans due to a completely random and unavoidable accident. Z just
happened to be in the garbage room and, as we all know, our garbage
shoots transfer sound much like the horn of a phonograph. You are
familiar with the things, no doubt. Anyway, a message was heard, a
conversation ensued, and we decided to take Z into our confidence
rather than punish a servant who was only doing their job and was in
the wrong place at the wrong time. I rest assure you, Z is without
pretense and is nothing but an asset to us in our objectives.&quot;</p>
<p>Kamek stared at them for a moment lost in thought. &quot;Those
good old phonographs,&quot; he mused, returning to the mess of papers
he'd made. Iggy and Ludwig gave each other a glance and left the
room.</p>
<p>&quot;I've never seen gramps so...frantic, angry, absent minded...
Really he had a bit of everything going on. He had to have set a
record for strange behavior,&quot; Iggy whispered as they distanced
themselves from the room.</p>
<p>Ludwig pouted. &quot;Also notice that we failed to bring up our
original inquiry!&quot;</p>
<p>Iggy threw his hands up. &quot;Dang! You're right! Now what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will put up a line of defense. Nothing too crazy, but
enough to not make it too easy for Mario.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You think gramps will mind us taking all of these liberties?
It can't be good for his blood pressure to blow up again like that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;True, he has been disturbed lately. Don't want to send him
over the edge, do we? I AM the army general however,&quot; Ludwig
said with some importance, &quot;and I believe I am authorized for
such small scale endeavors. Tea?&quot;</p>
<p>Iggy shook his head. &quot;I'm gonna do something else instead. By
the way, you heard of Peach's emergency call? Mario and the rest are
definitely gonna get here today.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes and? Better to get this over. See you later I suppose.&quot;
Ludwig waved as the separated from Iggy to head for the kitchen.</p>
<p>Back inside Bower's private quarters, Kamek almost jumped for joy.
He held the paper close to his face, so as to read the small print.
After heading a few lines, he folded it up, satisfied, and left the
room, not bothering to tidy up.</p>
<p>&quot;Just in case...&quot; he said to himself.</p>
<p><strong>What will befall our heroes now? Will the fact that they
know the full story (or what they think is the full story) help or
hurt them? Stay tuned.</strong></p>

<p>Bowser Junior pushed his tricycle to the limit in his frantic
excursion from Dark land to Toad Town. Despite the speedy 'slick
tires' modded on the Koopa Prince's bike, it was already an hour
later when he reached Toad Town. The site the big city froze him on
the side of the road in shock.</p>
<p>Beep beep! A truck honked, breaking him out of his daze.</p>
<p>&quot;Be careful, kid!&quot; the human truck driver yelled down.
Junior stepped back on the sidewalk and looked up into the huge
vehicle, a YoshiMobile service truck that was stopped at a red light.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, I'm lost! Where's Mario?&quot; Junior asked the driver.</p>
<p>&quot;What? You want...Mario?&quot; the driver asked
bewilderingly. She took off her truckers cap and scratched her head.
&quot;Aren't you one of those Bowser people?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am, but umm, this is really important so I need to see him
now, or else!&quot; Junior pulled out a threatening looking water
gun, having learned his negotiation skills from his father.</p>
<p>The driver shrugged. &quot;Sorry! Can't help ya, kid. That
plumber's always running 'round town.&quot; A car behind the truck
beeped, and the truck and other cars took off, zooming past him.
Junior stood on the curb defeatedly until something caught his
attention. Through a gap between the vehicles, Junior thought he saw
a glimpse of something red. After another break, he confirmed it.
Mario was just across the street, not far from the post office, with
his back turned.</p>
<p>&quot;Marrrriiooo!&quot; Junior's prepubescent voice was
overpowered by the sound of the cars. Determinedly, Junior hopped
back on his bike and circled the block from the safety of the
sidewalk, looking for some way to cross the street in one piece.</p>
<p><strong>Across the street...</strong></p>
<p>Mario's eyes went wide. &quot;What are you doing? You know there
might be agents and uh- &quot;</p>
<p>Peach pulled off her hood. &quot;You don't believe that do you?
The brute is trying to scare us! He has to be taken down!&quot; Her
last words wavered.</p>
<p>Mario shook his head. &quot;But-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Listen Mario, I know Luigi 'dismissed' you, but I say you
can go anyway! Only you can do this...By the way, have you called
Bowser?&quot; Peach gave him a suspicious look. &quot;You talk on the
phone- you admitted that.&quot;</p>
<p>Mario looked her in the eye. &quot;I haven't spoken to Bowser!
Well, I did try I mean, but that was this morning and it didn't go
through... Besides, that was before we got his message&hellip;&quot;
Mario answered, unsure where she was going.</p>
<p>Peach put the hood back on which hid her expression from Mario.
&quot;Well, that's what I wanted to tell you. May the stars be with
you on your trip to Bowser.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, I was going to do that anyway. In fact, I really
wanted to get to him first. Say, you think you could help me get
there in a pinch?&quot;</p>
<p>Peach turned away. &quot;Maybe someone at the castle can help, but
I have business at MK East. I'm sorry, Mario.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Princess! Wait!&quot; Mario knew Peach had a habit of
getting curt in times of crisis, but this was ridiculous, he thought.
Peach continued to put a distance between them and just before Mario
could follow, he heard someone screaming in the sky.</p>
<p>&quot;Whoooaaaaoo!&quot; Junior yelled as he flew in the sky above
the cars. His little plan involved using a ramp he'd made from
leaning a stolen surf board from a nearby shop on top of a display
kitchen oven. His bike shot over the four lane gap, landing next to
Mario, but with so much speed that he skid all the way into some
bushes outside the post office. The impact made several berries roll
on the ground.</p>
<p>&quot;What the Bonzai Bill?!&quot; Mario only saw a blur pass him.</p>
<p>The Postmaster, who had just exited the Post Office to sweep,
cursed. &quot;Who's ruining my Yoshi Fruit bushes again?!&quot; Mario
suspiciously approached the bush as the Postmaster picked up a Slick
Tire that was laying around.</p>
<p>&quot;MARIO!&quot; the bushes screeched, making everyone jump.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey that sounds like- Junior?! Why were you doing dangerous
tricks like that?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, you hooligan!&quot; The Postmaster added, waving the
slick tire around as Junior crawled from the bushes. His previously
neat and clean Koopa Scout uniform was dirty and torn.</p>
<p>&quot;That was AWESOME! I mean, my daddy said that-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Whoa, hold it there! You know you're an enemy of our kingdom
right now, right? Uh, let's talk inside the post office.&quot; Mario
nudged Junior away from the greenery.</p>
<p>&quot;Mario, the post office is not a stunt devil hideout,&quot;
The Postmaster warned.</p>
<p>&quot;It'll be fine, okay? And he's just a kid, he must have
something important to say. Trust me.&quot; Mario always viewed
Junior as more of a troublemaker pawn in the hands of his father than
a true evil doer. He'd never isolate himself with a Koopaling or any
other lackey of Bowser, however.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Postmaster was just about to finish sweeping when a
dark cloud stirred up in front of him.</p>
<p><em>Whoooossshhh!<br/>
</em><br/>
The Postmaster froze. &quot;What
in the-&quot;</p>
<p>From the dark cloud emerged a seemingly normal looking Monty Mole,
head hung low, and wearing a hazmat suit.</p>
<p>&quot;Now what was that all about, son? You had me thinking I was
dealing with some kind of-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where is Mario?&quot; Jimmy asked in a deep voice. &quot;I
detected him...here...&quot;</p>
<p>The Postmaster suddenly got a strange chill. &quot;He happens to
be inside now. Uh, can I help you sir?&quot;</p>
<p>Jimmy looked up, his sunken eyes and dark aura now apparent, and
smiled sadistically.</p>
<p><strong>Inside</strong>.</p>
<p>Junior jumped up and down. &quot;-So camp sent me home early and
so I came home but something was wrong and the castle lawn was
horrible and the pets weren't feed and I wandered and wandered and
then I asked a guard were daddy was and he was all like- 'shhh, don't
tell nobody' and I was all like, 'why?' and was all like, 'King
Bowser is in the dungeon' and I was like, 'omg' and so I ran down
there and I saw daddy down there!-&quot; Junior explained in a single
breath.</p>
<p>Mario stepped back. &quot;What? You mean?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And so he told me that there he didn't do anything and- SAVE
MY DADDY!&quot;</p>
<p>Mario took a deep breath. &quot;I believe you and know Bowser's
innocent. How can I explain this...Me and him-&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Bam!</strong></p>
<p>Postmaster burst through the closed door. His body flailed past
Mario and Junior and landed on the wooden floor resulting a thud as
the door violently slammed against the wall and bounced back close.</p>
<p>&quot;POSTMASTER!&quot; Mario screamed.</p>
<p>&quot;Hehehe!&quot; a gravely voice cackled from just outside the
door. Jimmy peaked inside through the crack in the door.
&quot;Heeeerrree's Zimmy!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Agent Jimmy?!&quot; Mario stepped in front of Junior
protectively. &quot;Why are you here, and what's wrong with you?&quot;</p>
<p>The door opened itself and 'Jimmy' glided in the post office.</p>
<p>&quot;Mario! I can help!&quot; Junior whined from behind.</p>
<p>Mario glanced back. &quot;Junior, are you sure-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Watch out!&quot; Junior leaped forward to push Mario our of
the way of a glowing blue flame. As Mario and Junior hit the floor,
the blue flame lingered in the spot for a moment then dissipated,
mysteriously not leaving a mark on the wood floor.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh Mario,&quot; 'Jimmy' bellowed, &quot;what's wrong, hehe?
I just wanna send you and Bowsy somewhere where you can live happily
ever after!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean?!&quot; Junior balled his fists. &quot;My
daddy is fine!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So you told your daddy, hehe. Well I'm equal opportunist so
you can gameover too!&quot; He shot another blue flame towards them.
Before Mario could react, Junior shot the water gun. A jet of crystal
blue water met the flame and a loud sizzle resulted from the
combination.</p>
<p>Mario jumped up. &quot;Good work Junior, but since when could
Jimmy do this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ugh, It's Zimmy now! Get it right!&quot; he whined. He
lifted his arms and two wooden floorboards lifted and flung towards
Mario and Junior. Mario dodged behind the counter and Junior behind a
fake house plant. The wooden projectiles missed their target by a
hair.</p>
<p>&quot;Come out and play!&quot; Zimmy teased.</p>
<p>&quot;Play with this!&quot; Mario's fireball Zimmy, scorching his
yellow hazmat suit to black, but he otherwise continued to smile
grotesquely. Just then, Mario heard groaning coming from the
Postmaster's body. He glanced to the fallen postal worker, then to
Zimmy, then to Junior who was no longer behind the house plant.</p>
<p>&quot;Junior?!&quot; Mario asked in a panic, surprised at his own
sudden concern for Bowser's normally bratty kindergartner.</p>
<p>&quot;Yah!&quot; Junior came out of nowhere to jump on Zimmy's
back, almost covering the Monty Mole completely. Zimmy howled and
spin around wildly, trying to shake the him but Junior held on for
dear life, gripping firmly with his claws. Mario jumped over the
counter to assist, but not before stopping next to the Postmaster,
who stirred slightly when Mario keeled near.</p>
<p>&quot;Err...M-mario...&quot; The Postmaster didn't open his eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll get you help, old pal. Lay low,&quot; Mario whispered.</p>
<p>&quot;Right,&quot; he coughed, &quot;The hooligan came here in a
cloud, like a Boo or something...be careful...&quot;</p>
<p>Before Mario could respond, Junior was finally shaken off from
Zimmy, landing near Mario and the Postmaster. Junior landed shell
first and the impact made his water gun fly out of his hands and his
backpack fling elsewhere.</p>
<p>Mario stood up fuming. &quot;If want to fight, let's do it proper!
I know a nearby Smash Bros stage and everything. It's really me you
want, right?!&quot;</p>
<p>Zimmy's eyebrows rose. &quot;You want to- You know the Smash
Bros?&quot;</p>
<p>Mario crossed his arms. &quot;Course I do. In fact, I AM him you
could say. You and me, right now. I don't even know what you want
with me, but I'm willing to do it to protect my friends. Eldstar
knows I've been screwing that up lately..&quot; Mario mused towards
the end. &quot;..Anyway, so what will it be?&quot;</p>
<p>Zimmy jumped up and down like an excited child receiving a
present. &quot;As you wish, buddy! Hehehehe!&quot;</p>
<p><em>Whooooosh!</em> Purple clouds conjured out of nowhere and spun
around the room in a twisted cyclone. Mario, afraid but determined,
stood his ground as Junior covered his eyes. After a sound like a
thunder strike, the cloud settled and Junior lifted one hand to see
that only he and the Postmaster remained in the room. Papers were
everywhere, along with the damage to the furnishings and wooden
floors.</p>
<p>Junior looked around frantically. &quot;MARIO?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Guess I'm gonna have to redecorate this place after all,&quot;
the Postmaster said feebly, &quot;After forty years, ha! Good thing
Parakarry already took Mario's message..&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Old Guy? Are you okay?&quot; Junior's voice wavered. He
noticed that the Postmaster had lots of scrapes and bruises.</p>
<p>The Postmaster smiled benignly. &quot;You're not a hooligan like I
thought, kid. Mario's the greatest guy I know. He'll handle things
alright..&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I've almost earned a paramedic badge at camp. Maybe I
can- umm...&quot; Junior retrieved his backpack and dug around in it.</p>
<p>&quot;Just..call the hospital ... And the Princess. Phone is...on
the counter...&quot;</p>
<p>Junior did as he was told automaticly, stunned by the events and
Mario's altruism.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>Peach quickly distanced herself from Mario, an easy feat with her
knowledge of Toad Town. She had been ignoring the buzzing of her
cellphone for some time, and finally checked it in desperation. She
saw that Toadette had blew it up with messages, which didn't entirely
surprise her. Peach was sure that loyal but worrisome Toadsworth had
gotten all in Toadette's case by now, and she just hoped Toadette was
able to fend him off. One look at the message header however gave her
a shock.</p>
<p>Peach stopped under a tree to read the fist paragraph that
Toadette had sent. She suddenly felt light headed. The dreaded
Mushroom Flu was coming from expired FungusUp and Bowser was possibly
forced to send a message? In all of her years, both as a ruler
herself and observing her father who ruled before, she had never
heard of a plot so twisted. She planned to immediately relay this
info to everyone in her confidence, but first she looked at the
remaining paragraphs. When she got to the part mentioning her father,
she gasped out loud. She immediately took off her high heels,
tightened her cloak, and made a dash for the hospital, forgetting to
relay any info to anyone.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>At the Toadley Clinic, Dr. Toadley was setting his desk in his
lab, lazily watching reruns of Dr. Bullet Bill on his computer. The
titular &quot;doctor&quot; was on the stage talking with a family of
four Whomps, a father, mother, and two children. &quot;So you say for
your whole life, you've been stepped all over. Why do you let this
happen?&quot; Dr. Bullet Bill asked with exaggerated eagerness.</p>
<p>&quot;Us rock people are second class,&quot; the father explained,
&quot;and we're sick of it. One day, we destroy you all! We rule the
world!&quot; His family agreed as the live audience went wild,
apparently amused by the threat.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, someone has big plans!&quot; Dr. Bullet Bill announced
as they went to a commercial break.</p>
<p>&quot;Does this televised family have serious issues? Yes they
do!&quot; Toadley opened another tab on his browser and searched
'Special World Hospital'.</p>
<p>&quot;FYI. They do! Squawk!&quot; said his bird, caged nearby.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in the opposite corner of the room, Toad and Daisy were
lying in cots Toadley had put them in after testing. Silently they
awoke and just like before, they both shot up with nothing
restraining them. The clinic was falling on hard times and their
'restraints' would have been just pants belts. One was currently
holding Toadley's pants and the other in a closet somewhere. Why lock
down unconscious patients, he thought. He was the expert, and in all
of his studying of Mushroom Flu, no one had ever 'coma walked' more
than once in a day.</p>
<p>The two 'fresh from a hospital' mini tyrants unanimously decided
to start their new rampage with Doctor Toadley and silently but
menacingly approached him.</p>
<p>&quot;Hmm. Does this special hospital have a lower rating than
mine? Apparently so...Hey! You are awake?!&quot; Toadley turned
around and nearly fell out of his chair at the sight of them. &quot;Stop!&quot;
He got up and picked up his chair to defend himself, backing up to
the wall behind his desk. He gave the wall clock a half second glance
and cursed himself. This was a new day, but since Toadley almost
never slept, he had a habit of losing track of time. &quot;Am I
seriously screwed right now? Yes I am!&quot;</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>Bowser's dungeon took up almost the entire lower level of his
castle. There were only twenty five cells but they were large enough
to fit thirty to fifty people, depending on how cramped and
uncomfortable he wanted his prisoners. It was dark, slightly damp,
humid, and the only sounds were dripping water and the low rumbling
of the nearby lava lakes.</p>
<p>Bowser groaned out loud at no one in particular, almost ready to
lose his mind. His dungeons were just so unpleasant, so he was
conflicted between annoyance and being proud of his work. He was
emotionally drained as well, already missing the normal life. He
wondered what he might be doing had the whole thing turned out
different. Would he and Mario had won their match? What would they
had done next?</p>
<p>Bowser stomped for the millionth time. &quot;I can't believe I'm
saying this, but where is Mario?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pssst!&quot; Bowser stared blankly at slightly cracked
dungeon door. A moment later, it gently swung open further to reveal
Wendy O. Koopa.</p>
<p>&quot;Doctor Professor?&quot; Wendy addressed, looking pale. The
Doctor approached his bars hesitantly. &quot;We're uh...transferring
you. I'm sorry, it wasn't my idea but you will no longer be in this
castle.&quot;</p>
<p>Doctor Professor shrunk back into the shadows as Wendy turned to
Bowser. &quot;Umm, King Dad. They're gonna get you out of here too-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And send me to Fahr Outpost as well?!&quot;</p>
<p>Wendy gasped. &quot;King Dad, wait. I'm so sorry! I need to tell
you that-&quot; Her words were cut short as footsteps were heard
briskly coming down the steps. Wendy turned to the door as Ludwig ran
in, his exertion obvious by the sweat on his forehead. This gave
Bowser a nagging feeling like something was off, but what?</p>
<p>&quot;Wendy?! Morton told me EVERYTHING! What were you doing down
here?!&quot; Ludwig asked between his pants.</p>
<p>&quot;I was just giving them the announcements!&quot; Wendy
covered her mouth with her hands.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, but I am very sure I told Morton to do it. Now why
would you want to to that for him, huh?&quot; Ludwig spoke in a
controlled rage.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't- know? That was all I did!&quot; Wendy cried. She
ran past him back through the doors, her high heels making a rapid
clack all of the way. Ludwig was just about to pursue her when he
took a scan of the room. When his eyes met Bowser, the glance
lingered.</p>
<p>&quot;Well don't stare at me,&quot; Bowser said offhandedly, &quot;I
don't know anything. How can I, when we do things in this castle
behind other people's backs?&quot;</p>
<p>Ludwig let out the breath he'd been holding in and whisked his
hair back. &quot;Ignore the theatrical scribble you observed. You
will be out of here soon, and back to your throne room.&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser rushed to the bars. &quot;Really now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, King Dad. How could we ever rule a kingdom
without you?&quot; Ludwig explained, his words belying his annoyed
expression.</p>
<p>&quot;So. What's going on?&quot;</p>
<p>Ludwig paused before answering. &quot;You know, don't you?&quot;
Without waiting for a response he turned to exit the dungeon,
grabbing the heavy door. Before sealing it tight, he stopped in the
doorway. &quot;I just want this to be over as much as you do...&quot;</p>
<p>The door slammed shut, but Bowser's mind didn't sink into
depressing depths like it did before. He now had a plan.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p><strong>Mushroom Press</strong></p>
<p>Mitch closed his note book, looking impressed. &quot;You oughta be
a story teller, Mr. Bullet. Makes since with you being from a dream
world and all.&quot;</p>
<p>Sebastian flushed. &quot;Thanks uh, no one has ever said that to
me. So that's it?&quot; Sebastian was secretly kind of disappointed.
Mitch was weird, he thought, with his often smug facial expressions
never matching his genial and soothing low voice. Despite that,
something was also oddly infectious about the green capped Toad.</p>
<p>Mitch turned to his laptop. &quot;Hmm, guess so. Here, take this
gift. I'll see you around, okay?&quot; Mitch turned around to face
him with a one hundred coin bill now in his hands. Sebastian's eyes
lit up at the sight of the golden currency.</p>
<p>He walked out of the building feeling like a new Snifit. Sure,
he'd lost his job and his only 'friends' in the area, but with his
new change on hand he could accomplish anything. He even had an
impressive Bachelor degree to work with, but little experience
outside of commission based MKDCU work. He needed a job now, and he
could think of only think of one place that would take him.</p>
<p>After a stepping out of the taxi, Sebastian was once again at the
Toadley Clinic. He straightened up the black and white polka-dot neck
tie he had picked up on the way and flattened out his red robe. His
MKDCU suit had been promptly discarded and he wore his normal Snifit
attire. He was frankly kind of leery about Toadley, but he knew the
guy would have to be glad to have another doctor in the house. It
couldn't be easy running the place by himself aside from that lobby
receptionist.</p>
<p>Sebastian pushed open the doors and marched straight up the to
front desk. He heard screaming coming from the back room and froze
for a moment.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes?&quot; the receptionist asked, breaking him out of his
daze.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Hi! My name is Sebastian Bullet.&quot; Sebastian put out
his hand to shake. The lady confusingly took it. &quot;Remember me? I
was just suited differently...Anyway...&quot; Sebastian laid down a
3x5 card he'd hastily written out which described his honors.</p>
<p>The young Toad girl looked at it for a moment and then back to
him. &quot;Excuse me sir?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was wondering if you had any open positions? I'm a doctor
also.. kind of, and maybe Dr. Toadley could use some-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Doctor Toadley works alone.&quot; Her words were quick but
professional.</p>
<p>Sebastian nodded. &quot;Okay, I get it. I don't want to take over
or anything, I-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He already has an intern. Me.&quot; She pointed to herself.</p>
<p>Sebastian slouched, about to call it quits. &quot;Uh, thank you
ma'am. Tell me though, does he always scream back there?&quot;</p>
<p>She gave him an apologizing look. &quot;Sorry sir. I never
question him. He's...weird...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly,&quot; Sebastian agreed. A banging noise, like a
metal cage hitting the ground, caught their attention.</p>
<p>The intern stepped away from behind the front desk suspiciously.
&quot;-But it might not hurt to peek. The doctor gets excited about
his work, but he has been going on for a few minutes now.&quot; She
slightly opened one of the double doors and Birdley flew through the
thin gap.</p>
<p>&quot;F.Y.I! On the loose! On the loose!&quot; Birdley flew around
the room in a frenzy, even losing a feather or two in the process.
The intern snapped from the bird to what was happening inside of the
lab and gasped.</p>
<p>Sebastian rushed to her. &quot;What's wrong?! Wait, oh right! Toad
and Daisy are still-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Am I getting beaten to a pulp right now?! ACK! YES I AM!&quot;
Toadley screamed, face down on the floor. Toad was on his back,
trying to strangle him with his own stethoscope while Daisy was
tugging on his pants legs, attempting to drag him around the lab.
Toadley's belt was the only thing keeping him from losing his pants.
Remarkably, nothing in the lab was damaged aside from an upturned
chair and Birdley's cage on the ground.</p>
<p>&quot;Doctor!&quot; the intern screamed, &quot;let him go!&quot;
She rushed to Toad in an attempt to push him off. Sebastian's heart
stopped. How did the MKDCU handle this before? Their usual strategy
was to get Wiggletron to restrain patients with his Herculean
strength but that wasn't going to work here. He only had one idea.</p>
<p>Sebastian jumped in front of everyone. &quot;Look at me!&quot; He
waved his arms wildly.</p>
<p>&quot;What are you doing?&quot; the intern asked. &quot;-Whoa!&quot;
She and Toad fell off of the Doctor.</p>
<p>&quot;Call the Red Capped Guy!&quot; Toadley gasped as Daisy
dragged him to the corner of the lab where the beds were.<br/>
&quot;You
mean Mario?!&quot; Sebastian asked. The moment he mentioned the
plumber, Daisy and Toad stared at him hypnotically. Daisy let go of
Toadley's feet and Toad pushed himself away from the intern, leaving
her to shiver traumatically. The tyrants slowly approached Sebastian
like they did Toadley before.</p>
<p>Sebastian immediately caught on. &quot;Yep. I'm Mario.&quot; He
gestured towards himself in an exaggerated way. &quot;Or I know him
depending on what's triggering you guys!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm calling the cops!&quot; the intern cried, scrambling for
the land line phone that sat on Toadley's desk.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, do that! I can handle them in the meantime...I think.
Come and get me!&quot; Sebastian dashed through the double doors to
the lobby, making sure Toad and Daisy followed. Sure enough, both
where hot on his trail. He exited the clinic to the contrastingly
peaceful outdoors, and ran down the sidewalk directionless. He didn't
know where was he going or what was going to happen if he got caught,
he just ran. As he lead them around the block, people nearby either
ignored, cursed at, or cheered on the trio, thinking they were either
typical, aggravating, or inspiring joggers. Sebastian was tempted to
scream for help, but reasoned that that might just shift the attack
to someone else. He just needed to keep them occupied for now. Just
as he was approaching the third lap, an unusually large mob of
pedestrians were heading towards him head on. Realizing that no cars
were coming, Sebastian crossed the street to go the opposite
direction with Toad and Daisy close behind. Immediately, he saw
salvation. A Toad Town police car already in front of the Toadley
Clinic!</p>
<p>&quot;Police! Help!&quot; Sebastian huffed, dashing across the
street again towards the officer's car.</p>
<p>The cop blew a loud whistle. &quot;Slow down!&quot;</p>
<p>Sebastian had no choice but to run around and around the car with
Toad and Daisy following in a demented game of 'tag'. &quot;I
understand officer but I <em>literally</em> cannot stop right now!&quot;</p>
<p>The cop kelp blowing the whistle. &quot;All three of you, stop! Is
this a joke?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No! Toad and Daisy are coma-walking!&quot; Sebastian
explained in between breaths. &quot;I'm scared- help me!&quot;</p>
<p>The cop shook his head and pulled out a radio from the car's
dashboard. &quot;I'm going to need backup. I have three of those
extreme jogger delinquents again. This time their making a mockery of
me!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Meanwhile...</strong></p>
<p>Kylie Koopa, Jelectro Bond, Richard, and Wiggletron were walking
in downtown Toad Town, blending in with the typical assortment of
city dwellers. Bond and Kylie lead the way hand in hand while Dick
and Wiggs followed, Dick staring a hole in the back of their heads
and Wiggs enjoying the urban scenery.</p>
<p>Dick sighed loudly. &quot;Why are still hanging out?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because Richard, you two gentleman keep following us
around!&quot; Bond responded playfully. Kylie giggled at his
response.</p>
<p>&quot;Is it not early for such banter?&quot; Wiggletron asked.</p>
<p>Bond shrugged. &quot;I am only saying that the four of us are
clearly life partners now, mon ami. Let us hit Club 64 again!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bond, stop! You're crakin' me up!&quot; Kylie playfully
nudged him.</p>
<p>&quot;Do not flatter me. Richard is the better comedian!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I refuse to talk now,&quot; Dick remarked. He typed a
message on his phone as they walked and showed it to Bond. It said,
&quot;Just this one time, I'll <em>defiantly</em> go with you
weasels, and Wiggs of course, but I'm <em>defiantly</em> getting the
window seat.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You mean 'definitely', brother,&quot; Kylie corrected. &quot;As
a writer, that mistake offends me personally!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Er, uh, no! I meant defiantly. Yeah, can't let anyone think
I listened to a suggestion from Bond of all people!&quot; Dick
blurted out. Kylie lost it until Bond calmed her.</p>
<p>&quot;You are fine by me, Richard. I failed English twice, believe
it or not.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;K, fine. I failed math once or twice,&quot; Kylie admitted.</p>
<p>&quot;Social economics,&quot; Wiggs added.</p>
<p>&quot;Ha! I've never failed anything!&quot; Dick said proudly.
&quot;Who's smart now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But did you not admit to me that you cheated?&quot; Wiggs
asked innocently. The look on Dick's face said it all.</p>
<p>Soon the four entered now reserved and less rowdy restaurant. The
change of atmosphere made it seem like a completely different place.
Having missed the lunch rush hour, the club was half empty so the
crew habitually sat together near the window.</p>
<p>&quot;What would you like, dear?&quot; Bond asked.</p>
<p>Kylie looked over the breakfast menu. &quot;I dunno. Their number
one combo I guess? It seems loaded with two eggs, five sausages,
three pancakes, five bacon strips, two oranges, a bunch of other
stuff, and a drink.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That meal can feed five, watch out. That and all of the
other combos under the number four.&quot; Dick stared out of the
window in boredom.</p>
<p>&quot;Well excuse me, brother!&quot; Kylie shot him a nasty look.
&quot;You would know, would ya?&quot;</p>
<p>Across from them, an officer had his radio go crazy. The clumsy
Whomp fumbled a while until he found it in a pocket, even dropping
his donuts in the process.</p>
<p>&quot;I think I will have the number two.&quot; Wiggs closed the
menu.</p>
<p>Dick pried his eyes away from the window. &quot;Didn't you hear
what I said before? That's just a vegan version of the number one!&quot;</p>
<p>Wiggs smiled sweetly. &quot;Correct. I am aware that the two of us
equal less than five.&quot;</p>
<p>Dick blinked several times. &quot;Huh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He's paying for your meal, mon ami!&quot; Bond said with a
wink.</p>
<p>Dick laughed nervously. &quot;Oh yeah...thanks...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Quite a business partner you got there!&quot; Bond whispered
to Wiggs, in futility.</p>
<p>Dick fumed. &quot;Don't make ME knock you in the fish tank this
time-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;On the way!&quot; The Whomp jumped up and slapped a few
coins on this table. He waddled his way out of the door, passing the
crew and especially catching Bond's attention.</p>
<p>Bond started, &quot;We need to go!&quot;</p>
<p>Kylie grabbed his arm. &quot;Wait, what? Did you get the scoop on
that?-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, or most of the details. This is bad, but close by. We
can make it if we run through a back alley or two.&quot; Bond hopped
out of the bench seats and Kylie got up to follow. She turned around.</p>
<p>&quot;Well? You two 'gents' gonna come with?&quot; Kylie asked
impatiently. &quot;But don't expect pay this time!&quot;</p>
<p>Wiggs got up in nervous anticipation. &quot;Of course! Would you
also accompany, Richard?...Richard?&quot;</p>
<p>Dick mumbled something in agreement and followed.</p>

<p>Luigi and his team were traversing through Giant Land. According
to their map, they were supposed to be taking a shortcut to the next
world which would have been Sky Land, but their map messed up the
scale a bit. Topographically Giant Land was the same as the Mushroom
Kingdom. Same lush greens, blue skies, and sentient hills. The
problem was that Giant Land being Giant Land, what seemed to be a
mile on the map was actually several.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm getting thirsty,&quot; Alagold moaned. &quot;What if we
don't make it?&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi hit a giant &quot;?&quot; block and got one coin from it.
&quot;I'm sorry. You knew this wouldn't be easy, but take this coin.&quot;
Luigi game him the coin from the block. &quot;It's silly, but when me
and Mario were younger and we'd be on adventures, he'd give me the
first coin we'd found to hold on to. As long as I held on to it,
things were going to be alright. I guess it worked. We haven't had a
game where we've failed...yet..&quot;</p>
<p>Alagold stared the coin and then clutched it tight. The group
silently trekked the millionth giant hill.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey guys! Let's play a game, hehe!&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi tuned to Boo. &quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm thinking of something green..&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Me?&quot;</p>
<p>Boo blushed, catching the attention of Yoshi.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, how about something else? Has anyone traveled here
before?&quot; Yoshi asked, suddenly chatty.</p>
<p>Buckenberry had his hands in his pockets and his head sunk low.
&quot;Toadette told me that her cousins had. They loved it because
they could get the cheapest smallest hotel room and it'll still be
luxury sized by our standards. What time is it?&quot;</p>
<p>Alagold looked at his phone. &quot;About one o'clock. We need to
eat lunch or something.&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi stopped and faced the rest. &quot;I guess we can now. I kind
of planed for us to already be halfway to Bowser before we ate. I
mean, that's the way Mario would do it, but with these hills...&quot;
Luigi dug into the basket he was carrying. Boo, Yoshi, Buckenberry,
and Alagold stood near in a circle. Luigi pulled out wrapped
sandwiches and bottled waters, notably leaving the FungusUp in the
basket. &quot;It's not much, but lunch is served!&quot;</p>
<p>The five sat and ate for a while on the top the grassy hill,
observing the scenery.</p>
<p>&quot;Why do you cut your sandwich like that?&quot; Buckenberry
asked. Luigi's sandwich was cut into an X pattern and he'd eaten two
of the sections.</p>
<p>&quot;This? Oh, just an old habit. Me and Mario would do this so
if we came across a friend, like a starving Mushroom Retainer, we
would be ready to share...&quot;</p>
<p>Buckenberry gave Luigi and earnest look. &quot;You miss him, don't
you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course. He's my brother and..well...he's Mario,&quot;
Luigi answered vaguely.</p>
<p>&quot;But we have to do what we have to do,&quot; Yoshi butted in.
He had finished his meal predictably before anyone else and was
laying back and looking at the sky.</p>
<p>Buckenberry turned is way sharply. &quot;Come off it!&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi stood up. &quot;Enough, you two! Geez, guys...so anyway
let's keep our guard up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You really think we might be attacked?&quot; Boo asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Who knows? This IS Giant Land. I know we're in rural
territory, but if we meet anyone they might have a tendency to
be...abrasive. I spot a village over there.&quot; Luigi pointed to a
clearance in the forest a small distance way. &quot;It's a little out
of the way of our path out of here. What do you guys think?&quot;</p>
<p>Boo got up and stood beside Luigi. &quot;Aye aye, captain!&quot;</p>
<p>Alagold mindlessly played with the coin in his hands. &quot;I
think so too. We might get some info on a quicker way out I guess.&quot;</p>
<p>Buckenberry stood up. &quot;Sure, but I have something to say!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; Luigi asked annoyed. He could clearly see the
hostility still in Buckenberry.</p>
<p>&quot;It's to you!&quot; Buckenberry pointed to Yoshi.</p>
<p>Yoshi got up confused. &quot;Me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. First of all, you were always uncomfortable to ride in
NSMB. Secondly, what is your problem?&quot;</p>
<p>Yoshi rolled his eyes. &quot;Oh, I don't know? Maybe my friends
are currently dying from something we could have completely prevented
if Mario wasn't so naive all the gosh darn time!&quot;</p>
<p>Something about his mild insult made Buckenberry boil over. He got
in Yoshi's face. &quot;Mario is the greatest guy on this planet and
I'll have you know that he would never try to get any of us hurt!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Blue!&quot; Luigi warned. Boo and Alagold stood behind him,
watching the scene not unlike a train wreck.</p>
<p>&quot;Back off!&quot; Yoshi growled. &quot;Listen to yourself!
You're just a fanboy!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No! Take it back!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What you said about Mario being naive!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why should I? It's true!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nuh uh!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wow, you are such an amateur...&quot; Yoshi shoved
Buckenberry back and he responded by punching Yoshi near his right
shoulder.</p>
<p>&quot;Yow! You're crazy!&quot; Yoshi gasped.</p>
<p>Luigi immediately stepped between them and physically held
Buckenberry back. &quot;Once again, this is PITIFUL!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He's psycho!&quot; Yoshi held his shoulder.</p>
<p>&quot;More like bipolar,&quot; Luigi huffed, still holding
Buckenberry, &quot;but Blue did have a point. Something is different
with you!&quot;</p>
<p>Yoshi shook his head. &quot;I guess so... Mario was once my hero,
but now he just isn't the guy he use to be. I just don't understand
why I'm the only who seems to notice...&quot; Yoshi started to walk
away.</p>
<p>&quot;Yoshi, we're not done- where are you going?-&quot;</p>
<p>Yoshi looked back. &quot;Clearly I don't belong with you guys
anymore. I'll be taking the warp back home. I'm sure you'll defeat
Bowser.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But what about you?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you really care?&quot; Yoshi turned and walked off
disappearing in the foliage soon after. Luigi felt a pain in his
heart the same way he did when Mario left. Buckenberry wiggled out of
Luigi's grasp, snapping him out of his thoughts.</p>
<p>&quot;Blue, if you even think about-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not after him anymore! I just..I quit...&quot;
Buckenberry broke into tears.</p>
<p>Luigi crossed his arms. &quot;Fine. You are dismissed.&quot;
Buckenberry ran down the path Yoshi took, still sobbing.</p>
<p>&quot;From five to three,&quot; Luigi sighed out, covering his
face. &quot;Let's just get to the village.&quot; Luigi packed up and
lead the way in the descent from the hill. Boo noticed the look on
his face and held his hand. Luigi smiled as Boo's words from the
previous day came to mind. Alagold trailed behind, clutching the coin
tightly again.</p>

<p>Mario dropped down from the dark cloud, dizzy and nauseous. The
thick, hazy air that <em>seemed</em> to stem from the teleportation
itself made Mario cough as he lay bent over.</p>
<p>Zimmy stood in front of Mario with a smirk. &quot;What's wrong,
hehe? Get up so we can brawl...or Melee!&quot;</p>
<p>Mario rubbed his head and took a look around. &quot;Of all the
'Mario' themed *cough* Smash Brothers courses, you choose...the roof
of Peach's Castle?&quot;</p>
<p>Zimmy snorted. &quot;Well, Melee was always a favorite. You aren't
a 'casual', are you?&quot;</p>
<p>Mario stood up. &quot;Not funny. This isn't even set up to be a
course right now, don't you see?&quot;</p>
<p>Zimmy's smile disappeared. &quot;You wanted a Smash Brothers
course and you got one, fool. Now we fight and if I win, I get your
body! <em>And I do look forward to that.</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>Mario got a sudden chill in his spine. &quot;...You're a boo,
aren't you?&quot; And clearly not just any Boo, Mario added in his
mind.</p>
<p>Zimmy looked up at the clouds in the sky in a whimsical way. &quot;Hmm,
maybe?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, the Postmaster told me, and you're just using old
Jimmy's body in a sick puppet show!&quot;</p>
<p>Zimmy clapped his hands slowly. &quot;Bravo plumber, but I'm
growing impatient, hehe!&quot;</p>
<p>Zimmy charged towards Mario and tackled him to the ground. In a
dull thud, they slid across the roof together all the way to the back
of the castle, even sliding down the sloped edge. Mario ended up on
his back with his body partially overhanging the roof. As Zimmy
whaled on him, Mario caught a glimpse of the drop below, and just
like that, the nausea was back.</p>
<p>&quot;Better step it up!&quot; Zimmy sang like a demented child.</p>
<p>Mario pushed Zimmy to the side and sprung up, almost losing his
balance. Mario knew was getting pounded on a bit, but he'd never felt
so worn out so quickly&hellip;</p>
<p><em>Ssssssssss</em>!</p>
<p>Mario's backside was in scorching pain from a flame.</p>
<p>&quot;Ha! You aren't much without your buddies aren't you?&quot;
Zimmy teased as he watched Mario run around in circles to put the
fire out.</p>
<p><strong>Meanwhile</strong>&hellip;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, thanks.&quot; Toadette marked out another name on her
clipboard.</p>
<p>&quot;What's that?&quot; The purple spotted podium Toad asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, uh, nothing.&quot; She tried to lift the clipboard up to
obscure his view.</p>
<p>&quot;Hon, I already saw it. I've been wanting to be able to do
that, but I guess only managers like you can get that list.&quot; He
pointed to the back turned clipboard teasingly.</p>
<p>Toadette pouted in defeat. &quot;Kind of. Just me, the Princess, a
few others, and have permission. Speaking of which, you sure you
haven't seen him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nope. The four weird plumbers left and there's been nothing
going on. That's all you called me up here for?&quot;</p>
<p>Toadette nodded. &quot;I just wanted to be sure. Gotta keep our
guard up and stuff, right?&quot;</p>
<p>He shrugged. &quot;Sure, whatever. I needed the exercise. See you
later&hellip;&quot;</p>
<p>Toadette retreated into Peach's room and plopped back on the bed
again, lazily dropping the clipboard on the ground. She'd finally
spoken to all twenty-seven castle employees working that day, and now
it was time for the waiting game again. She hated being stuck in the
castle warding off Toadsworth while Mario and the gang and apparently
even third parties such as spies and reporters were out solving and
investigating a Bowser conspiracy. She also wondered by Peach hadn't
replied to her text message. She'd expect some kind of reaction at
least...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Toadette quickly sat up and looked around, having heard a noise.
She slid off the bed and crept through the glass doors to Peach's
balcony.</p>
<p>&quot;You cheap shot!&quot; someone screamed.</p>
<p>Toadette looked upwards. &quot;Mario?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just give up, hehehe!&quot; someone else said. There was
something about that <em>tone</em>...In a sudden panic, Toadette ran
back inside to Peach's room, pulling out her phone only to put it
back away. She was in the castle, surely the twenty-seven inside
could come to her aid quicker?</p>
<p>There were two light knocks on the door. &quot;Miss Toadette,
surely you are not still cleaning are you? I need to have a word with
you!&quot;</p>
<p>Toadette sighed a breath of relief and swung open the door without
hesitation. Toadsworth invited himself in with an unhappy look.</p>
<p>&quot;Miss Toadette, I am disheartened that you would place such
games with me!&quot; He stopped near clipboard in the floor but took
no notice.</p>
<p>Toadette nodded. &quot;Uh well, sure. Listen, I think I heard
Mario on the roof and then-&quot;</p>
<p>Toadsworth put up his hand. &quot;No more excuses! I know that our
Princess is either not present or is hiding in some worrisome game.
Tell me, which is it? Well?!&quot; Toadsworth got a chime on the old
brick style cell phone that was strapped to his waist and he put it
to his ear. &quot;Hello?&quot;</p>
<p>Toadette heard more commotion on the roof and was about to inch
away to the balcony again when Toadsworth signaled her to not move.</p>
<p>The elder's face changed from annoyance to puzzlement. &quot;I
see...You don't say?!...Yes, he may enter...Very well, thank you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;May I ask, Mr. Toadsworth?&quot;</p>
<p>He strapped the phone back on. &quot;I Might as well share. Our
guard informed me that Master Yoshi has came back to our kingdom
early from Master Luigi's expedition. There were no explanations
given&hellip;&quot;</p>
<p>Toadette gasped. &quot;I wonder- nevermind! Maybe that's great,
Yoshi does hang out on the roof a lot!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever do you mean?! I am wise to your deflection games
now, so if you do not come clean, I hate to say this, but I will be
reporting you to the Princess! Whenever I can find her, that is!&quot;</p>
<p>Toadette beckoned him to the balcony and Toadsworth slowly
followed.</p>
<p>&quot;You do not mean that she is out here?&quot; Toadsworth
asked, looking around the back of the castle from their high vantage
point.</p>
<p>Toadette shook her head. &quot;I'm gonna be honest. She's not
here, but first I need you to listen, Mr. Toadsworth. Hear that?&quot;</p>
<p>They stood silent for a moment. Then there was a dull thud and a
moan from above.</p>
<p>Toadsworth squinted trying to look above. &quot;What in blazes?-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know, and I think I heard Mario up there! Please drop your
investigation for now and let me go downstairs to get Yoshi so we can
check this out!&quot; Toadette held her hands together in the best
pleading look she could give.</p>
<p>The elder sighed. &quot;Very well, Miss Toadette. See what that
ruckus is, but the moment that is straightened out, you WILL come
clean about what you know. Agreed?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you Mr. Toadsworth!&quot; Toadette hugged him briefly
and ran off, leaving Toadsworth on the balcony.</p>
<p><strong>On the roof</strong>.</p>
<p>Mario blocked Zimmy's blows the best he could, but the plumber was
still getting hurled to the hard pink shingles. To add to the
powerful fist attacks, blue colored flames often accompanied them in
a painful two-for-one special. After the fifth cycle of get punched,
get burned, get tossed like ragdoll, Mario kneeled over in
exhaustion.</p>
<p>&quot;Pause..&quot; Mario groaned. A warm red liquid dripped from
his nose and splashed onto the shingles. Mario cupped his nose in
surprise and horror.</p>
<p>Zimmy stepped close. &quot;Ha ha ha! <strong>Game set</strong>!&quot;</p>
<p>Mario looked him straight in the eye. &quot;..You sneaky piece of
crap. Of course you'd do something to me with your teleportation
before the fight even started.&quot; Mario words slurred slightly.
His clothes were burnt black in places, he'd felt like he'd sprang
something, and he could barely stand.</p>
<p>Zimmy snorted again. &quot;Aren't we smart?&quot;</p>
<p>Mario surprised him by smiling, which combined with his bloody
nose wasn't a pretty sight. &quot;Whatever you do won't matter
because I made my brother Luigi the leader this morning, and he's
going to save the day before sundown.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Luigi?!&quot; Zimmy gasped.</p>
<p>&quot;Did I stutter? I believe in him, and all of my friends. I've
let them down a lot, but they are the best friends an Italian
Brooklynite can ask for. Know what else? I know you have something to
do with what happened to Bowser and I hope he kicks your butt too.&quot;</p>
<p>Zimmy rushed in Mario's face and pulled him down by the collar.
&quot;Shut your mouth, fool! Bowser is NOTHING to me or that green
idiot, Luigi! <em>I just hate Luigi</em>!&quot; he screamed
hysterically.</p>
<p>&quot;Mario!&quot; someone called.</p>
<p>Zimmy looked around and dropped Mario on the floor. &quot;I've
won! We made a deal&hellip;.wait who's speaking?&quot;</p>
<p>A Yoshi egg popped Zimmy in the face, knocking him away from
Mario, and making his portly body roll.</p>
<p>&quot;Mario? What's wrong with you?!&quot; Toadette jumped off of
Yoshi's back and rushed to the plumber. Yoshi followed but froze at
the sight of his bleeding nose.</p>
<p>Mario opened his eyes. &quot;Toadette? How did...It's p-p- need a
power up&hellip;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No one backs off of a deal from ME!&quot; Zimmy rushed
towards Mario but Yoshi intercepted by tackling him. The Yoshi and
Monty Mole rolled near the center castle spire. Yoshi quickly
recovered and picked Zimmy up with both arms.</p>
<p>&quot;What is your deal, Jimmy?! WHAT'S WRONG WITH MARIO?!&quot;
Yoshi asked, shaking Zimmy in anger.</p>
<p>&quot;Yoshi!&quot; Toadette shouted, holding Mario's head up as he
laid flat. &quot;You have a power up, right?&quot;</p>
<p>Zimmy kicked Yoshi back to make him drop him. &quot;IT'S ZIMMY!&quot;
He shot several fireballs at Yoshi, who slurped them all up and shot
them back. Now Zimmy had to run around in circles until the fire went
out. The moment it did, Yoshi ground pounded right in top of him and
he was launched against the center spire and bounced off to the
ground again.</p>
<p>Yoshi turned back in a panic. &quot;What were you saying? Oh
right, I don't have a power up!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?!&quot; Toadette cried. Mario now lay limp in her arms.</p>
<p>Yoshi looked back at Zimmy, coming up with a plan.</p>
<p>Zimmy got up and stomped the ground. &quot;Gah! This furry rat is
too weak. You should all be dead by now! What the heck are you-&quot;</p>
<p><em>Slurp</em>!</p>
<p>Yoshi held Zimmy in his mouth and instantly experienced the worst
taste ever. It was almost unnaturally bad, but he swallowed anyway
and laid an egg. He threw the egg on the castle spire to break it and
out dropped Zimmy, and a STAR! The power up bounced on the roof
leaving sparkles in it's path.</p>
<p>&quot;This is it! Hope it's not too late!&quot; Toadette grabbed
the star and rushed back to Mario's body.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>NOOOOO</em>!&quot; Zimmy howled as another black cloud
appeared. The wind started to stir and roof shingles were blown
about. Yoshi ran back to Toadette and Mario as she gave him the
powerup. A familiar chime played as Mario glowed rainbow colors and
jolted up.</p>
<p>&quot;What happened?&quot; Mario gasped. He then saw the black
cloud and windstorm stirring. &quot;Guys! Get behind me, I'm going
in!&quot; Toadette and Yoshi nodded and Toadette hoped on Yoshi's
back as he took her to the farthest edge of the roof. Mario ran
straight into the cloud and leaped straight in the air, aiming at the
source of the cloud.</p>
<p><em>Whoooooosshh!</em></p>
<p>Mario's feet landed on the ground normally. The windstorm was
gone, leaving only a damaged roof and Jimmy's confused and unclothed
body near Mario's feet.</p>
<p>&quot;Whoa, it's Mario! Hey buddy, where am I? Yow! You gots an
aspirin too, right?&quot; Jimmy spoke, holding his head.</p>
<p>Mario cursed. &quot;He got away&hellip;.&quot;</p>
<p>Yoshi and Toadette rushed to them as Mario's invincibility wore
off.</p>
<p>&quot;Mario I-&quot; Yoshi started.</p>
<p>Mario turned to them and hugged them both. &quot;I knew I could
count on you guys..&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What was that?&quot; Toadette asked, too confused to think
about sentimentality.</p>
<p>&quot;I think James knows exactly what happened,&quot; Mario said
accusingly. &quot;Let's get off of this roof, and I'll explain
everything.&quot;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Later, Mario, Yoshi, Toadette, and Toadsworth were in the castle's
front lobby. Mario had explained to Yoshi and Toadette all that had
happened to him since getting kicked off of the team, and came up
with an excuse to tell Toadsworth. Toadette mentioned what happened
with the &quot;plumbers&quot; that had met her earlier and soon the
three were up to date with the situation, as far as they knew it.
They decided to be honest to Toadsworth about Princess Peach, but
they thoroughly explained that there was no threat of any secret
agents and with Mario's charm, Toadette was off the hook for lying. A
roofing repair company was promptly called and already on their way
over.</p>
<p>&quot;Just promise me this, Mr. Toadsworth. Mention it to the
board committee to install a door to the roof!&quot; Mario said with
a smile, the starman from before having completely restored his
health.</p>
<p>Toadsworth laughed. &quot;Yes, of course. You never know when a
Tweester will land right on our castle like that, right Miss
Toadette?&quot;</p>
<p>She laughed nervously. &quot;Uh, yeah...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And I am glad that the Princess is safe after all. You may
continue your adventures, but do be careful, okay?&quot;</p>
<p>Mario nodded. &quot;We will, thanks.&quot;</p>
<p>Mario, Yoshi and Toadette exited the castle. Jimmy was outside,
being watched by the front door guard. Upon seeing Mario and the
rest, he put his Nintendo DS away and picked up his spear before they
noticed.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, sir! Here is your prisoner!&quot; the teenaged guard
said.</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks. We'll take him from here,&quot; Mario said.</p>
<p>They traveled down a forest foot path that lead from the castle
and into downtown Toad Town. Jimmy was forced to lead the way under
Mario's supervision, and Yoshi and Toadette closely followed. They
were planning to go to the hospital to catch up on Peach and her
father, hopefully find Junior, and get Jimmy checked out.</p>
<p>&quot;Good excuse you came up with back there. I forgot how good
you were at that kind of thing...&quot; Yoshi spoke up.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah and thanks for somehow getting me out of major
trouble,&quot; Toadette added.</p>
<p>Mario glanced back. &quot;Listen, I should be thanking you guys! I
was a goner up there. Not to change the subject, but Yoshi, how were
my brother and the others doing?&quot;</p>
<p>Yoshi observed the forest surroundings. &quot;We were in Giant
Land, way behind schedule. I didn't get kicked out by the way, if
that's what you're thinking. I kind of...left...&quot;</p>
<p>Toadette looked at him curiously. &quot;Why?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Me and Buckenberry got into it again.&quot;</p>
<p>Toadette rolled her eyes. &quot;Of course. So he left too, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, actually. I was surprised he didn't come with me back
to the castle.. I hope he wasn't THAT angry with me...&quot;</p>
<p>Toadette purposely kicked a few rocks as she walked. &quot;Nothing
gets through to him, so I figured. He'll show up&hellip;&quot;
Toadette's offhanded tone made everyone silent for a while.</p>
<p>&quot;Yow! Got a 'nother cramp!&quot; Jimmy yelped and stopped in
his tracks, holding his side. &quot;Why are yous punishing me like
this?&quot;</p>
<p>Mario nudged him forward. &quot;Keep walking! We know you know
more about that Boo that was possessing you, and after we visit the
hospital, you know where you're going..&quot;</p>
<p>The path finally led the group to the first main road. A stark
contrast from the rural forest path, they were now back in the big
city. Mushroom Kingdom East Hospital wasn't far by, now it would only
be a matter of getting a taxi for the four.</p>
<p>Toadette stepped ahead boldly. &quot;Let me do this. I'll take Mr.
Mole and flag down a taxi.&quot;</p>
<p>Jimmy turned her way sharply. &quot;Little missy, it's Agent
James, and why do I need to go with you?!&quot;</p>
<p>Toadette tugged on his arm, forcing him to follow her to the curb.
&quot;Because two is better than one when it comes to flagging down
taxis. You aren't from the big city, are you? Besides, we're both
short, so a busy driver might take pity on us and think we're lost
little kids.&quot;</p>
<p>Jimmy jerked away. &quot;No, I ain't from around here, but that
makes sense- wait, did yous call me short!?&quot;</p>
<p>Off of the sidewalk, Yoshi turned to Mario and spoke in a low
voice. &quot;I just want to clear something up. That fight me and
Buckenberry got into was over you. To put it short, he believed in
you, and I kind of didn't, and I didn't all the way on the way on my
trip back until Toadette came running to me the moment I entered the
castle. She said something was wrong on the rooftop and she was
scared for you. When I finally saw you on that roof, I got so sad,
angry, afraid, everything else! In a flash I remembered all of our
happy times together, everything you've done for everyone, and how
you're my best friend&hellip; I'll admit I got a bit stuck-up over
this Bowser conspiracy thing, but I just want to say that even if I
don't get why you do some things, it doesn't mean you're not the
Mario I've always loved and known. Best buds?&quot; Yoshi held out
his hand.</p>
<p>Mario smiled and grabbed his hand. &quot;Best buds..&quot;</p>
<p>Toadette waved at them, there was a taxi waiting.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>Dr. Toadley's intern walked out of the doors to see the wild chase
happening involving Sebastian, Toad, and Daisy.</p>
<p>&quot;Officer! Get these people!&quot;</p>
<p>The officer looked her way. &quot;Ma'am, stay back! We have
extreme joggers here, and I have backup on the way! They're just
taking a while to show..&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But aren't you a cop? Please!&quot; she plead.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course. It's go time!&quot; The officer jumped through
his open window, right in the path of Sebastian. &quot;Halt right-&quot;</p>
<p>Sebastian collided with the officer, sending him backwards as they
both fell into the street. Daisy and Toad wasted no time trampling
over then promptly attacking the cop and Snifit. Daisy went for the
officer, resorting to her 'drag the person around senseless' strategy
she tied on Dr. Toadley before. Toad whaled on Sebastian, forcing him
to run around frantically with Toad on his back. Cars swerved out of
the way of the commotion in the street and bystanders on the
sidewalks cleared away quickly.</p>
<p>&quot;This is still a disaster!&quot; the intern cried as another
siren was heard drawing near. The up coming police vehicle drove
wildly towards the clinic, almost causing a few accidents. It skid to
a stop on sidewalk right behind the first cop car, haphazardly
knocking over a fire hydrant and making water spray everywhere.</p>
<p>A Whomp officer pried himself out of the tiny car. &quot;Oops! I
fix that later! What is problem?&quot; he asked, standing in the
downpour of water.</p>
<p>&quot;There!&quot; the intern pointed towards the street.</p>
<p>The Whomp pulled out a taser. &quot;Right! Stop, or else!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Get these freaks!&quot; the first officer coughed, spitting
out some dirt that was in his mouth from being dragged through the
grass.</p>
<p>Zap! Sebastian fell to the ground, having been tased. Toad forgot
about him and ran to harass the cop with Daisy.</p>
<p>&quot;I meant the girl attacking me! Oh no! HEEALP!&quot; the cop
screamed as Toad pulled on his arms. Daisy and Toad now held the
human cop in a deadly game of 'tug of war' that went on in front of a
dark alley next to the clinic.</p>
<p>The intern rushed through the puddles to the Whomp. &quot;Don't
you have anything else?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh...&quot; The Whomp aimed fiddled around his tool belt and
settled on a Bob-omb.</p>
<p>&quot;You might not want to do that, mon ami!&quot; Jelectro Bond
spoke, leading the way out of the back alley on the other side of the
clinic. Wiggletron emerged right after and immediately made a bee
line for Toad and Daisy, snatching them up and forcing them to drop
the cop. Kylie Koopa and Richard innocuously walked on on the wet
sidewalk.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe the appropriate phrase would be, deja vu!&quot;
Wiggletron droned. Daisy and Toad squirmed in his arms like the day
before.</p>
<p>&quot;Good work, but why is MKDCU agent Sebastian on the ground?&quot;
Bond asked.</p>
<p>&quot;What? Sebastian?&quot; Dick asked, leaning over his body.
&quot;What's going on?&quot;</p>
<p>The intern took a deep breath. &quot;Well&hellip;&quot;</p>
<p>She explained everything.</p>
<p>The intern let out the deep breath. &quot;...And that's about it.
Guess it's the Special World Hospital for them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;NOOOOOOO!&quot; Bond, Kylie, Dick, Wiggs, and Dr. Toadley
screamed.</p>
<p>She scoffed. &quot;Gosh, okay!? I'm just saying that they're
clearly dangerous psychos now. Since when was the Doctor here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did I arrive here during your extremely long explanation?
Yes I did! Is the Special World hospital a death sentence for our
heroes? Yes, according to research I did before the attack. Follow me
inside.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dr. Toadley, wait. Aren't you injured?&quot; his intern
asked.</p>
<p>Toadley shook his head as he limped back towards the clinic doors.
&quot;Do I have broken bones? Possibly. Do I care? Not really.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Actually I think you should!&quot; the cop butted in. He
looked comical with the stitches coming out of his dirty clothes from
being pulled on. &quot;Besides, the tall Wiggler over here can't hold
them forever!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You'd be surprised,&quot; Dick added. &quot;We really should
bounce, people are staring and water is getting in my shoes.&quot;</p>
<p>The human cop blew the whistle. &quot;I don't think so. How's that
report going?&quot; He turned to the Whomp officer who was near his
car.</p>
<p>&quot;Me have problem! No waterproof paper!&quot; The Whomp shook
the soggy report paper around.</p>
<p>The human cop face palmed. &quot;How about you try to write it
while NOT standing under the fire hydrant water!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Here, fella can borrow mine,&quot; Kylie said, ripping off a
copy of the detailed report she had already written.</p>
<p>&quot;Wow, the Mushroom Kingdom police suck!&quot; Dick said
brashly, which made Bond look at him disapprovingly.</p>
<p>&quot;You cannot blame the police force for being in the state it
is in when Mario usually handles the big crimes and they usually
stick to writing parking tickets,&quot; Bond explained.</p>
<p>Sebastian woke up. &quot;What's happening? Whoa, where did this
water come from? What?&quot;</p>
<p>The intern took a deep breath. &quot;Well&hellip;&quot;</p>
<p>She explained everything again.</p>
<p>She let out the deep breath. &quot;...And that's about it.&quot;</p>
<p>The human cop threw his hands up. &quot;Okay fine, we're out of
here. You people are annoying anyway.&quot; He jumped in his car
through the open window again.</p>
<p>Bond stood beneath his window. &quot;Chief Inspector Douglas, do
not forget Sergeant Howie back there, mon ami!&quot;</p>
<p>The officer looked around. &quot;Oh yeah. Let's go, Howie!&quot;
he called to the Whomp. He sped off and the Whomp followed in his own
beat up police car.</p>
<p>&quot;How did you know the cop's- oh right...&quot; Dick mused.</p>
<p>&quot;How did he know?&quot; Sebastian asked.</p>
<p>&quot;I am a 'magikoopa like freak'!&quot; Bond answered
playfully. &quot;But I am glad you're on our side now. I guess I will
explain, but not as verbosely as Mary T. over there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, I heard that!&quot; The intern fussed. &quot;Wait, how
did you know my name?&quot;</p>
<p>After a brief explanation, everyone went back inside the clinic to
properly restrain Toad and Daisy behind plastic containment
compartments. Dr. Toadley still refused to go to the hospital but an
examination from Sebastian thankfully showed that there were no
broken bones.</p>
<p>&quot;So, can I have a job here then?&quot; Sebastian asked.</p>
<p>&quot;No-&quot; Mary started.</p>
<p>&quot;Can you? Yes you can! I have been waiting for an assistant
forever!&quot; Toadley answered genially. He hopped off of the exam
table, passing Dick who was playing 2005 era flash games on the
laptop, and Wiggs who was being entertained by Birdley in his cage.
Toadley grabbed a white doctor coat out of his closet and handed it
to Sebastian.</p>
<p>&quot;Well lookie here. We got a happy ending almost..&quot; Kylie
said. &quot;Well I think I got my 'dynamite scoop of the century'
report all set out, I just gotta get to the press, and get a bite to
eat!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Press? I was just there, telling my story to this Mitch
guy,&quot; Sebastian commented as he tried on the coat.</p>
<p>Kylie lost her mind. &quot;Mitch?! What a dirty, sneaky, back
stabbing...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Here we go again, mon ami,&quot; Bond whispered to
Sebastian. &quot;Every time we go somewhere, something bad occurs, so
how I call I just call delivery and we all eat here?&quot;</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>Ludwig Von Koopa's first infantry lined up in the yard in front of
Bowser's Castle. It consisted of goombas, koopa troopas, parakoopas,
hammer bros, and fire bros. This group were to protect the area
immediately before the boarder to World 8, otherwise known as Dark
Land. Ludwig sent them off to scout the land and get in their
position as he readied the second group.</p>
<p>&quot;Hmm, I have counted nine boomerang brothers. Where is the
last one?&quot; Ludwig asked no on in particular. He and the second
group were in the courtyard, where large groups of baddies could
group together before departing into the land. His soldiers,
consisting this time of boomerang bros, rocky wrenches, para-goombas,
lakitu, and magikoopas, braced themselves for the typical blowup when
someone kelp Ludwig waiting. Only, it never came.</p>
<p>Ludwig was staring at his watch idly when the missing boomerang
bro ran on to the courtyard with a short trail of toilet paper stuck
under his shoe. &quot;Sorry I'm late!&quot;</p>
<p>Ludwig yawned. &quot;Wonderful, do not let it happen again. Okay,
roll call!&quot; Ludwig went through the roll call of his group of
forty monotonously. He dismissed the group with an arbitrary 'All
hail the Koopa Troop!' and they were off, this time to occupy the
first few levels of Dark Land.</p>
<p>&quot;Time for more tea,&quot; Ludwig said to himself as he walked
through the quiet calls of the castle. In the kitchen he saw that
Iggy was long gone, and everyone else for that matter. As he made his
tea, he randomly texted Bowser Junior for the fifteenth time. Such
texts weren't threatening but casual, asking how he was doing and
asking him to be safe. Ludwig was letting things play out. He'd been
debating something in his mind all day, and his confrontation with
Bowser was the culmination that made his next course of action clear.
Everything would stem on what he was about to do next, otherwise his
world and everyone else's would fall apart.</p>
<p>Ludwig went into his room and shut the door tightly. First he
called Iggy up to his room. He dimmed the lights and didn't let him
enter.</p>
<p>&quot;Yo, Luddy? What's wrong all of a sudden?&quot; Iggy asked
from outside his room.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not well...Organize a battalion for the later levels
and one for this castle for me, will you?&quot;</p>
<p>Iggy looked suspiciously at his door. &quot;Okay, Luddy. You sure
you will be okay?&quot;</p>
<p>Ludwig purposely paused a while before answering. &quot;Yes. I
should be well enough to fight by the time Mario is near here. Go!
And make them fierce too!&quot;</p>
<p>Iggy leaned away from the door. &quot;Fine. You call if you feel
any worse, okay?&quot;</p>
<p>Ludwig heard his footsteps walking away and retreated to his sound
proof recording studio that was in his room. He dialed a number and
waited for an answer.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello? Yes? This is the Special World hospital, correct?&quot;</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>Peach rushed into Room 555. In the dark, her father lay in the bed
with monitors set up, and he appeared to be sleeping peacefully. The
guard that arrived with him stood to the side, apparently having an
important phone call.</p>
<p>&quot;Daddy!&quot; Peach cried as he held him closely. Someone
stopped in the doorway.</p>
<p>&quot;Princess!&quot; Emery T. huffed, having ran all the way from
the top floor to the bottom. &quot;*pant* Mario texted me. He's gonna
come here with some friends!&quot;</p>
<p>Peach looked back with tears in her eyes. &quot;What good will
that do now?&quot;</p>

<p>The dungeon doors creaked open to reveal an armored Koopa soldier
known as the Koopatrol. Bowser stood up straight as he observed the
soldier approach him and stop just short of where his flame breath
could reach.</p>
<p>&quot;So I see, they're too afraid to show their faces now, ha!&quot;
Bowser thought out loud.</p>
<p>The Koopatrol, visually uncomfortable, cleared his throat and then
opened the scroll he was holding that Bowser missed in the darkness.</p>
<p>&quot;M-mr. Lord Bowser Koopa, according to 'Koopa Kingly Law
article xxii', you will now be returned to your proper throne as
ruler to all Koopa kind. And so uh, as ruler and leader you will be
expected to fulfill the needs and wants of your subjects to the best
of your ability...&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser listened patiently as he clumsily read the dictum for the
extremely uncommon occasion where a king steps down and then regains
his title. Bowser knew he didn't actually step down from <em>anything
</em>willingly, but that was another matter.</p>
<p>&quot;Say, whatever's best for the kingdom. I'm ready, private.&quot;
Bowser raised his claws in a sign of surrender. The Koopatrol
hesitated for a split second, then went through the proper prisoner
procedure minus the restraints as he was about to lead Bowser out of
his own dungeon.</p>
<p>Doctor Professor Koopa ran to his bars and clung on them. &quot;Bowser!
Surely you are not?!-&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser smirked at him as he exited the dungeon doors. The
Koopatrol lead him to his own throne room, where all of the
Koopalings and Kamek awaited him. Iggy, Ludwig, Wendy, and Larry were
to one side of his throne lined up. Morton, Roy, and Lemmy were to
the other and Kamek was near the door. Despite the atmosphere of
nervous excitement, Bowser noted that his meeting was undoubtedly
impromptu.</p>
<p>&quot;Glad to be back!&quot; Bowser greeted. He strode down the
crimson carpet that lead to his throne slowly and deliberately,
savoring his ordained sanctuary, at least according to 'old world'
Koopa customs.</p>
<p>&quot;I am glad to see you, your evilness!&quot; Kamek muttered as
he walked along Bowser. &quot;Please sit!&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser plopped down, giving everyone a quick glance as he did so.
&quot;Say, this a family reunion? Someone explain, or else!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Our King is about to direct us on our final war against
Mario, hehe!&quot; Z piped up, revealing himself from the shadows.</p>
<p>&quot;Huh?&quot; Bowser stared at the dark boo trying to recognize
him.</p>
<p>Iggy turned pale. &quot;King Dad, it's our garbage collector, Z.
He is uh, how to explain this?&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser waved his claws. &quot;No need to. I know Mario is on his
way and I know you plotted this to happen,&quot; he explained calmly.
&quot;No wonder you need me back in charge, you all suck at
planning..&quot;</p>
<p>Kamek's grip tightened on his scepter. &quot;Yes, my Lord and son.
Pray tell, are you willing to cooperate with us now!?&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser flashed his glistening sharp teeth. &quot;Know what,
gramps? Yeah actually. If you can't beat em, join em!&quot;</p>
<p>Everyone gasped.</p>
<p>Ludwig stepped forward. &quot;Father, what are you doing?!&quot;
Everyone looked at him annoyingly except Wendy and Larry, who shared
his sudden agitation.</p>
<p>Kamek bowed to the ground near Bowser's feet. &quot;Our King has
chosen wisely! Tell us what else, your nastiness!&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser casually leaned back and thought for a while. Z stepped up
to Bowser. &quot;Destroy them all,&quot; he whispered, his tone
dripping with malice.</p>
<p>Bowser rubbed his hands together. &quot;Of course! You all hear
that? Mario's gonna get it once he comes here, but there's more! That
Mushroom Flu, yep, I know about it. It'll turn the whole Mushroom
Kingdom mad, right? Listen, I'll be honest with yall. I did have fun
with Mario and freaks in the past, but what we've set up here will be
better than anything Mario could ever give me...&quot; Bowser said
with an edge in his voice. No one dared question that last sentence.</p>
<p>&quot;Aye aye captain!&quot; Iggy saluted, prompting Morton, Roy
and Lemmy join in.</p>
<p>&quot;Alright, now to your posts. We need to get busy,&quot;
Bowser commanded. At arm's length from his throne was a coffee table
to the side and a bookcase to the other. As everyone minus Ludwig
left promptly, Bowser glanced through some strategy books. Ludwig
approached Bowser one more time.</p>
<p>&quot;Father, seriously, what are you doing?&quot; Ludwig asked in
a low voice.</p>
<p>Bowser sighed in an exaggerated fashion. &quot;Well, what do you
think?! Don't give me that look, what's gotten into you?!...But
anyway, since you're here, and you ARE my army general, what do you
have lined up?&quot;</p>
<p>Ludwig paused, caught off guard. &quot;Father, uh, I have an early
Dark Land battalion and a mid to late one. Also for outside our
castle, and one for inside-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, huh. But they aren't our lazy workers, are they? You
know, the one's Mario can just jump over and beat the level in ten
seconds, right?&quot;</p>
<p>Ludwig shook his head. &quot;Of course not, only the meanest. Now
may I ask you something, father? Do you really want this to happen?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Am I stuttering here? YES! Stop wasting time and get out
there, that's an order!&quot; Bowser pointed to the door with
finality.</p>
<p>Ludwig slowly backed off. &quot;...Of course. I apologize for my
behavior before.&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser shot him an incredulous look as he left his throne room and
shut the door tight behind him. As Ludwig strolled down the halls, he
dug around his jacket pocket frantically for his phone.</p>
<p>&quot;Where is it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where is what, hehe?&quot; Z appeared out of a shadow and
floated along Ludwig, grinning mischievously.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing, Z. Shouldn't you be..wherever you should be?-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I've taken out all of the garbage and I was just running
errands, hehe. Say, how is Junior doing? He is all alone out there,
and if he's caught up with the Marios, there no telling what trouble
he might get in!&quot; Z explained excitingly.</p>
<p>Ludwig stopped and stared him straight in the face. &quot;Now, why
would you say such a thing? Where have your 'errands' taken you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm a busy boo. I do adore Toad Town and-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;-So you've seen him?&quot;</p>
<p>Z blushed. &quot;Hehe, maybe? You know, I just wanna help and if I
just had permission to head back I could uh, bring the lost lil tyke
home. I'm sure that's what our <em>King</em> would want.&quot;</p>
<p>Ludwig observed Z for a moment. He looked like an average dark
boo, yet there was <em>something</em>.. &quot;..You know, you have my
apologies for getting wrapped up in all of this, you just being a
common castle employee before all of this and now having to deal with
us royal Koopa hooligans. It is nice though, how quickly Kamek and
King Dad have accepted you, especially since such things NEVER
happen, is it not?&quot;</p>
<p>Z had a flash of an quizzical look before going back to booish
shyness. &quot;I suppose so, hehe. So, can I?&quot;</p>
<p>Ludwig shrugged. &quot;I am afraid such endeavors are prohibited
during times of war. It is for the better if you stay HERE. In fact,
that is an order from your military commander. Ta ta!&quot;</p>
<p>Ludwig took three steps before Z dodged in front of him. &quot;But,
but, I'm done with my duties and Kamek said I could do whatever I
pleased!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh why would he?!&quot; Ludwig started, &quot;...I mean,
okay then, but I don't want you bringing him back in a war zone. Take
the warps and do NOT use your Boo powers!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Seriously?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, okay?! I know you can do more than normal boos. I've
caught you!&quot; Ludwig accused.</p>
<p>Z stared blankly. &quot;...For real?&quot;</p>
<p>Ludwig facepalmed. &quot;Okay fine! You will not be getting
Junior, because&hellip;.I WILL!&quot;</p>
<p>Z giggled. &quot;Didn't you just say-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can break my own rules if I please! Now go help Iggy or
something, that's an order and where is my phone?!&quot;</p>
<p>Z returned the smug look Ludwig had given him earlier. &quot;Yeah,
guess it is better if you get Junior, hehe. I'll even keep it a
secret that you're breaking '<em>protocol'</em>. See ya around&hellip;&quot;
Z floated off down the hall, leaving Ludwig alone in the now eerily
quiet halls of Bowser Castle.</p>
<p>Ludwig entered his room to find his phone lying on his bed,
definitely not where he'd left it. His hand now being &quot;forced&quot;
he grabbed his traveler's bag and wrote a note mentioning that he was
going to bring Junior home. Getting contact with Junior and thusly
Mario was his only hope. Not that he cared about Mario or his
meddling associates, rather the more Z was around his family, the
more strange everyone become.</p>

<p><strong>Giant Land </strong>
</p>
<p>Luigi, Boo, and Alagold cautiously strode into the isolated
village's wide dirt roads. The weather was warm and the only sounds
were the ambience of wilderness. On the streets were no vehicles of
any kind and little presence of modern society aside from the
electric lamps that were fixed to the outside of the wood cabins. As
they took in the scenery, they were occasionally passed by a giant
villager on their usual business who either ignored or gave them a
spiteful glance.</p>
<p>Luigi stopped everyone and pointed to a building ahead of them
with a red colored roof. It was almost mansion sized to them, though
it would only be considered a large house to it's giant residents.</p>
<p>&quot;This has to belong to someone important, let's check it
out!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right on, Weegee!&quot; Boo rung the doorbell a few times.
Everyone looked to each other worriedly when heavy stomping was soon
heard.</p>
<p>&quot;Who is it?!&quot; A voice boomed.</p>
<p>&quot;L-luigi Mario? We are heading to Bowser and-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We have NO affiliation with Bowser!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We all hate Bowser too! We need your help!&quot; Luigi
shouted in desperation.</p>
<p>The door creaked open, revealing a Mega Goomba with a black bushy
goatee. His eyes darted between the three in suspicion. &quot;Okay,
so what? Are you injured?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, me and my friends just need help.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...Come in.&quot; He swung the door open for them.</p>
<p>They were lead down a hall that was &quot;decorated&quot; with
lots of medical diagrams. Outside of the den the mega goomba finally
led them to was even a skeleton, obviously from a human. The goomba
sat in the singular large chair near his fireplace and settled in
once more, bookcases and medical artifacts keeping him company, along
with the occasional 'thing' hung on the wall</p>
<p>&quot;So now, my miniature guests, we're here. What's the issue?&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi took off his cap in respect. &quot;First of all, thank you
for inviting us in Mr&hellip;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dr. Richard Goomba Senior.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dr. Richard Sr., I have one day to stop Bowser and we got
terribly behind schedule while traversing your expansive Giant Land
terrain. Is there a quick warp out of here to Dark Land?&quot;</p>
<p>He blinked a few times in puzzlement. &quot;You know, maybe, but
only my son would know about the warps around here. What's going on
exactly?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, doctor, our friends got infected with Mushroom Flu
yesterday, uh have you heard?&quot;</p>
<p>Richard Sr. shook his head. &quot;Hardly anything gets to us out
here, and Mushroom Flu, eh?&quot; He abruptly stood up and grabbed a
heavy book from the bookshelf nearest to him. Meanwhile Boo was
taking in the room fully. It had wood paneling and a dark green
carpet. The only light came from the windows and fireplace. Based on
the junk lying around also, It was clear this guy mostly lived in
this one room and probably didn't live with a female, at least not
anymore.</p>
<p>&quot;...You know, I'll never forget about when Bowser took over.
He put that really annoying glasses wearing koopa freak in charge,&quot;
Richard Sr. mused as he sat back down and leafed through the book.
&quot;Anyway, after that we had a revolution of sorts so that's why
most of us like to live in small little communities.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So there's no government?&quot; Alagold asked, trying to
process that.</p>
<p>He turned a few more pages. &quot;We technically still have one,
but that's another issue, and I don't talk politics with strangers!
You have to excuse my discretion 'cause I'll get fired up you see.
Just think of each community as its own little government.&quot;</p>
<p>Boo had wandered to the side and was intensely looking at hung
photo over the fireplace as Luigi listened.</p>
<p>&quot;Mister, wouldn't that be like a totally wild party?&quot;
Alagold asked.</p>
<p>Richard smiled.&quot;It's easy to think that, but takes a certain
type to live like this. 'A don't mess with me and there's no problem'
type of person. You Mushroom Kingdom folk have lived under a princess
with a one man army to protect you against anything. It's not like
that here. We have no heroes, so it's best to mind your business.
That being said, we still have honor. Everyone respects me as the
local physician. The only one now...Ah ha! Mushroom Flu. Says in my
medical journal that it can cause fainting, fever or in some cases
'coma walking'! Weird, I thought that famous Dr. Mario person got rid
of this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No offense doctor,&quot; Luigi said with a hint of
impatience, &quot;but we've been through that already.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hey is this your son?&quot; Boo blurted out. Luigi glanced
at said family photo of a younger Richard Sr. in a black suit and a
smaller goomba who was wearing a blue bow tie and frowning.</p>
<p>Richard Sr. eyed the picture with reminisce. &quot;Yes. Richard
Junior. Goes by Dick. Fiery fellow but he never liked it here much.
He studied to be a doctor for the community but it didn't work out.
He branched out doing menial labor and then last I heard, he joined
this ragtag group of medical agents. MKD-something&hellip;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The MKDCU? We've heard of them, they got mixed up in this
mess somehow, but does that really help?&quot; Luigi pondered.</p>
<p>&quot;No wait, Dick was at the hospital last night! I remember you
knocked him in the bushes or something!&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi smiled at Boo. &quot;You remember that? But how can we
contact him without wasting more time than it's worth?&quot;</p>
<p>Richard Sr. cleared his throat. &quot;Wait! If you need to contact
the Mushroom Kingdom, I have this.&quot; He pulled a rugged black
flip phone out of a drawer. &quot;Before our revolution, division
leaders would use these and since I'm the unofficial leader it found
its way into my hands. I have no idea how to use it, I'm a doctor,
not a tech wiz.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I am!&quot; Alagold spoke up. &quot;It's a satellite
phone meant for political leaders or ambassadors to be able to keep
in touch from kingdom to kingdom. I'd know working in a castle and
stuff and..why am I explaining this? Anyway to operate it, you need a
special code and well, maybe I can call the princess.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Way to go!&quot; Luigi patted him on the back. &quot;Ring
her up!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah that's great, cause my agency said something bad was
happening...and they're never wrong..&quot; Boo said gravely.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>Dick was playing the game &quot;Minesweeper&quot; on Dr. Toadley's
laptop when his game started to freeze and glitch. He responded by
tapping the escape key several times to no avail, then he thought he
smelled smoke. &quot;Oh crap!&quot;</p>
<p>Wiggletron, who was looking over his shoulder the whole time,
pouted. &quot;And you were avoiding annihilation so well..&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wiggs! Er..thanks. I mean, why is this crappy laptop doing
this?!&quot;</p>
<p>Kylie came over and leaned over the computer. &quot;Brother, pull
the plug and chill! Delivery's here!&quot;</p>
<p>The double doors leading to the lobby opened to reveal Toadley's
intern carrying several brown sacks labeled 'Tayce T.'</p>
<p>&quot;Yep, this is good home cooking, not that trashy Club 64.
They just suck there.&quot; Mary the intern continued her rant as she
sat the sacks down on Toadley's table. &quot;Yeah, totally trashy.
Some bozos broke their fish tank last night and they didn't do
anything about it, I heard. Crazy right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right.. wonderful meals, madam,&quot; Bond replied. He,
Kylie, Dick, and Wiggs all gave each other a knowing glance.</p>
<p>Soon everyone ate their meals in the lobby area aside from Dr.
Toadley, and his new assistant Sebastian, who were in the lab and the
still restrained Toad and Daisy, who were very much awake in their
cells but otherwise not doing anything violent. Yet.</p>
<p>Dr. Toadley was playing the game &quot;Minesweeper&quot; on his
laptop when it started to freeze and glitch again. Sebastian ran up
to him.</p>
<p>&quot;What's wrong?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is this what I get for playing games while using skype? Yes
it is. Incoming call!&quot; Toadley alt tabbed to the skype window,
revealing Toadette, who was clearly standing in the background of a
hospital.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello? Doctor? Yeah, me and Mario just got to the hospital
and it's confirmed, the King is sick. Peach is like, in shambles-
it's really bad! Did you know it was FungusUp all alone? The Princess
has authorized a recall but like, we don't think they were officially
distributed anyway so who knows if that'll help.. I gotta thank those
spies and reporters or plumbers, whoever they were. They were 100%
right with their warnings earlier.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes yes. What could we ever do without such diligent side
characters?&quot;</p>
<p>Toadette stared, waiting for him to finish.</p>
<p>&quot;Was that an actual question I was asking? Yes it was.&quot;</p>
<p>Toadette blushed in embarrassment. &quot;Oh, sorry.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well anyway, where are your helpers whereabouts? Here. Toad
and Daisy went wild just past noon and they saved my tail. Is Toad
and Daisy's condition deteriorating? Possibly!&quot; Toadley replied
pensively.</p>
<p>Toadette frowned. &quot;Did you know something went down at the
post office right after Mario sent his letter to Dr. Mario? Junior
and the Postmaster is here as well. Mario says it was James who did
it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;James, you mean Jimmy?!&quot; Sebastian gasped.</p>
<p>Toadette squinted at her screen. &quot;Who is that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Jimmy was my ex-boss!&quot; Sebastian said, crowding Toadley
out of the small area his laptop's feeble webcam could capture. &quot;How
is he with Mario?!&quot;</p>
<p>Toadette was about to say something but then she looked off camera
at someone. &quot;Uh, gotta go. I'll skype back later. See ya!&quot;</p>
<p>Toadette followed Mario on the way to patient room 555.</p>
<p>&quot;Has Toadley got anything?&quot; Mario asked.</p>
<p>&quot;...No&hellip;&quot;</p>
<p>Mario looked at her seriously. &quot;That's all? Toad and Daisy
are there, right? What's the condition?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh...we need to get them help. Today.&quot;</p>
<p>Mario shook his head. &quot;Well, the Postmaster will be okay.
Junior is shaken up but fine. I don't know what else to do. I know
Luigi and the rest can make it to Bowser, but how can we get a cure?
Dr. Mario might as well be an illusion nowall the way in Smash
Mansion. Dr. Toadley was my only hope.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mario, it'll be alright,&quot; Yoshi said walking up after
he'd left to take a phonecall. Mario lead them to room 555 with his
head hung low. Peach met them at the door but didn't let anyone in.
Her eyes were red and her skin pale.</p>
<p>&quot;Mario, it's in your hands now. Don't let us down&hellip;&quot;
her voice wavered.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course not, Princess.&quot; Yoshi and Toadette nodded in
agreement.</p>
<p>Peach dabbed her tears with a tissue. &quot;Also this, I just got
a strange call from Giant Land.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's where we, I mean Luigi and the rest were last time!&quot;
Yoshi explained.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, it was Luigi actually. He says they can get to Bowser in
an hour if someone named Richard Goomba showed them the way. His
father apparently told them that. You do what you can with that
info.&quot; Peach retreated into the room hastily with no further
discussion. Mario and the rest went back to the lobby and sat, which
was mostly empty with the hospital being on lockdown due to the
King's presence.</p>
<p>Mario turned to Toadette. &quot;Say, I overheard you talking about
agents and stuff. Who were those four people that gave you info at
the castle again?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I only spoke to two of them, but it was this Noki spy and
koopa reporter. Kylie, yeah that's it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Kylie the reporter. Wow...&quot; Mario stared at the bland
hospital walls, lost in thought.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah. I think she was with Toadley.&quot;</p>
<p>Mario almost flipped out of his seat. &quot;Really?! Call back
now!&quot;</p>
<p>Toadette scrambled for her phone again. After a moment, it picked
up and Mario took it.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey Dr. Toadley? Let me speak to the spies, reporters, and
plumbers!&quot;</p>
<p>Sebastian barged into the camera again. &quot;You mean Kylie,
Bond, Dick and Wiggs? Okay hold on.&quot; Screaming and yelling was
heard until Kylie was thrusted into the camera with a sandwich still
in her hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Yow! Hey I'm not done- Mario?!&quot; she gasped.</p>
<p>&quot;Kylie, great to see you again. Is your plumber friend a
goomba named Richard?&quot; Mario asked.</p>
<p>&quot;You mean 'brother'? He's not <em>actually</em> a
plumber...or my brother but&hellip;&quot; There was more commotion
and a goomba got in the camera. Because of his girth, only a small
portion of him could fit in the low quality shot but Mario and the
rest could make out a half eaten salad he held in us hands.</p>
<p>&quot;Yo Mario, Dick's here. I figured a popular guy like you
would be interested in me, heh!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm at the hospital and Peach got a call from Giant Land.
You're from there right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course! Land of the giants and not shorties like you. No
offense though, Mario! Seriously, you're great and I have a poster of
you on my wall!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, heh.&quot; Mario flushed. &quot;So your dad says that
you need to come back to help my brother-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Er-what?! Come back?!&quot; Dick quickly left the camera
view and Wiggs appeared, waving.</p>
<p>&quot;Pleased to meet you again, Mario. I only hope I can continue
to assist you on your journey..&quot;</p>
<p>Mario slowly waved back to the guy he remembered as being a robot
or something. Before he could reply, Bond appeared in the camera
view, casually sipping on a coffee of some sort.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello mon ami, pleasure to meet you finally. I am Agent
0064, aka Jelectro Bond.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, okay.&quot; Mario was suddenly reminded of speed dating.
&quot;Richard supposedly knows a warp that can get my brother from
Giant Land to Dark Land in an hour. This is really important, so does
he know or not?&quot;</p>
<p>Bond started blankly for a moment and then jolted. &quot;YES YES,
there is great danger ahead, mon dieu! Richard will cooperate
immediately, oh dear!&quot;</p>
<p>The skype call ended on that note.</p>
<p>&quot;This Bond guy must be a drama queen,&quot; Yoshi chuckled.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah there was something weird about him in our ten second
date.&quot;</p>
<p>Yoshi and Toadette looked at him weird, making Mario red in the
face.</p>
<p>&quot;-Uh, did that slip out? Either way, if Kylie is with them,
they'll get that Richard guy where he needs to be. Now I dread what
I'll have to do&hellip;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Which is?&quot; Yoshi asked.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm going to have to go to the Special World Hospital and
beg them to help us get a cure as opposed to locking Toad, Daisy, and
everyone else stricken with Mushroom Flu up forever. Well, I guess
we'd better take off. Junior should probably come with me with that
boo person around&hellip;&quot; Mario thought out his plan a little
more. &quot;And we can drop James off at a jail or something.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, I heard that!&quot; Jimmy joined them from a hallway
with Emery T. close behind.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Mole got away from me,&quot; was her excuse.</p>
<p>&quot;It's MKDCU Agent James. Why are all of youse Toad girls
annoying? So I see you realize my plans were right all along. I was
gonna head for that Special World place!&quot;</p>
<p>Mario stood and pointed to the door. Emery excused herself as
Mario, Jimmy, Yoshi and Toadette exited the hospital, getting
clearance from the guards now stationed outside, and stood in the
yard in front.</p>
<p>&quot;Now you listen here James-&quot; Mario's phone went off,
causing the plumber to pick it up angrily. &quot;Hello?!...Okay? Uh,
meet us...there, why not? Bye&hellip;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who was that?&quot; Toadette asked.</p>
<p>Mario scratched his head. &quot;Ludwig von Koopa. How he even has
my number, I don't know, but according to him, he has to see me
because he's getting Junior but also he has 'somezing very important
to share'&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh okay, we have time to chill.&quot; Yoshi looked at his
phone for the time. &quot;Maybe pickup some lunch too. It is past
noon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry Yoshi, I'll have to pass. You and Toadette are in
charge and don't let James out of your sight. I'm going to have to
take Junior and meet Ludwig at the Special World Hospital!&quot;</p>
<p>Just then Peach floated down from out of nowhere with her parasol.
She seemed completely different, no longer pale or restless. It
became clear to Mario that she was putting on an act before.</p>
<p>&quot;Shh! Guys, I actually heard the whole thing and I'm going
with you, Mario!&quot; She looped her arm around Mario's expectantly.</p>
<p>Mario saw that look on ther face, and knew she wasn't going to
take &quot;no&quot; for an answer&hellip;.</p>

<p><strong>Toadley Clinic</strong></p>
<p>Jelectro Bond threw up his hands. &quot;C'est pire que je ne
pourrais l'imaginer!&quot; Kylie Koopa, Wiggletron, Richard,
Sebastian, and Mary all crowded around him, still sitting in front of
the laptop.</p>
<p>&quot;Bond, what's happening?!&quot; Kylie cried. In a swift
motion she took her bottle of water and splashed it in his face,
freeing him from the trance.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, darling...&quot; Bond muttered groggily. He took
off his glasses to rub his eyes, which were cloudy again. &quot;Richard.
You HAVE to go.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I heard that,&quot; Dick remarked breathlessly, &quot;but
what happened you? You had even me worried for a moment!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, and what's wrong with your eyes?&quot; Mary asked.
Sebastian shared the horrified expression on her face.</p>
<p>&quot;It's 'cause of the same reason he knew your name,&quot;
Kylie replied quickly.</p>
<p>Bond held his head as if he had a headache. &quot;Sebastian
Bullet&hellip;.you know...Another...Like me. Mitch..You told...him
about this situation...We need his input, mon ami&hellip;&quot;</p>
<p>Sebastian had a slight vexing look evident even through his Snifit
mask. &quot;Did you just read my mind?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's probably not on purpose,&quot; Kylie excused. &quot;Bond
why do we need to do that too?&quot; she asked gently.</p>
<p>&quot;Because of the conspiracy. There's more but it is not clear&hellip;
I must speak to him now.&quot; Bond stood up abruptly and marched
past everyone, leaving the lab's double doors to the lobby. Kylie was
hot on his trail after giving everyone else one more apologizing
look.</p>
<p>Dr. Toadley, who had excused himself moments ago to feed Toad and
Daisy, (who in turn wasn't hungry and flung the food back at him),
gave everyone a curious look.</p>
<p>&quot;Is Minesweeper still open? Yes it is, thank goodness.&quot;
He sat in the computer chair and went back to playing, oblivious to
whatever drama had just unfolded.</p>
<p>Dick took a step back. &quot;I guess we're leading things?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Correct,&quot; Wiggletron responded. He laid a hand on
Dick's shoulder. &quot;Let us go.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Giant Land. Was not this information relayed to you as
well?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I can't! If I go back home...&quot; his voice wavered.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Dick expectantly.</p>
<p>&quot;...I'll be the pipsqueak again!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh?&quot; Mary asked.</p>
<p>Dick let out a deep breath. &quot;Okay it's like this. You know
how there's two types of people in this world?&quot;</p>
<p>Mary shrugged cynically. &quot;No.&quot;</p>
<p>Dick rolled his eyes. &quot;Well anyway, it's the 'shorties' and
'not-shorties'. Toads, normal goombas, shy guys, pretty much everyone
in this room except Wiggs here are the shorties and everyone else
isn't.&quot;</p>
<p>Mary tapped her foot on the tiled floor. &quot;Dick, where the
heck are you going with this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, in Giant Land we're all giant, so the system stays the
same. While I'm huge here, I was a shortie back home and I hated
that! Why do you think I moved in the first place? I hate being
small; people walking all over ya and stuff&hellip;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Does this remind me of an episode of Dr. Bullet Bill? Yes it
does,&quot; Dr. Toadley remarked, swiveling the chair around. &quot;But
time is short. Go.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course doctor.&quot; Wiggs led Dick away against his
will.</p>
<p>&quot;Cool it! So I'm guessing you won't take no for an answer?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You have guessed correctly.&quot; Wiggs pushed open the
double doors.</p>
<p>&quot;Aww,&quot; Dick whined as he stumbled forward, &quot;it's
like we'd made so much progress before.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How so.&quot; Wiggs responded, not bothering to make it a
question.</p>
<p>&quot;Never mind. I'll mosey on out,&quot; Dick muttered as he
capitulated. &quot;I know a shortcut too. I kind of know shortcuts
all over the place. Best to make this as quick as possible.&quot;</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p><strong>Bowser's Castle</strong></p>
<p>Iggy ran up to Kamek, who was in the kitchen fixing a late lunch.
The old magikoopa lay the knife he was using to spread mayonnaise
down and faced Iggy.</p>
<p>&quot;Gramps, I found a letter and-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In Prince Ludwig's room? Yes, Z has told me about his
departure. It is said that an army cannot keep the resolute to fight
without direction, and our military leader is absent. He must be
replaced.&quot; Kamek spoke slow and deliberately.</p>
<p>Iggy raised an eyebrow. &quot;You don't mean-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He must be replaced by our second in command!&quot; Kamek
repeated.</p>
<p>&quot;But gramps-&quot;</p>
<p>Kamek pointed out of the kitchen. &quot;Go! Make sure our new
leader is prepared. That's an order!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, sure.&quot; Iggy stumbled out of the kitchen, too lost
in his thoughts about how Larry Koopa of all people would lead an
army, that he didn't notice a shadow following him. Larry was often
the public face of the Koopalings, he even had a Facebook profile
that wasn't flagged for criminal activity like everyone else's,
including Ludwig who otherwise tried his best of avoid public
scandal. (In a strange case of friendly fire, Ludwig's profile was
eventually flagged due to trolls coming mostly from Larry's page!
Said fans were enraged about former Koopaling's distaste of pop
music). Larry of course had a side job as a DJ, even being allowed to
host parties in the Mushroom Kingdom. Now however, he was going to
lead the supposed final strike against Mario?</p>
<p>&quot;You sure think a lot, hehe,&quot; Z commented.</p>
<p>Iggy was jolted from his thoughts. &quot;Z?! Uh, hey. I was just
getting Larry apparently.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So I see. Do you wonder if Larry will be a good leader?&quot;
Z asked innocently.</p>
<p>Iggy hesitated with his response. &quot;Hey, like, I don't wanna
throw my brother under the bus, but Larry's always been..distracted.&quot;</p>
<p>Z held back a giggle. &quot;Tell me more!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well like, I dunno. Hard to say. He just kind of goes with
the flow is all. Luddy though, he was born to be a leader, but he's
seemed kind of funny recently&hellip;&quot;</p>
<p>They were silent until they reached Larry's room. Iggy covered his
ear with one hand and knocked a few times with the other. Momentarily
the 'trap' music that was blasting inside quieted down.</p>
<p>&quot;Who is it?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's me, Hop,&quot; Iggy whispered with a grimace.</p>
<p>Larry opened the door with an annoyed expression.&quot;What do you
want? And why is <em>he</em> here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Kamek wants you to lead the army that will destroy
Mario, hehe!&quot;</p>
<p>Iggy nodded. &quot;What he said..&quot;</p>
<p>Larry slammed the door in their faces. &quot;No no no no no...NO!
Why?!&quot; he cried through the door.</p>
<p>&quot;Ludwig bailed, Larry. Like, you're second in charge so
c'mon! You gotta step up eventually!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can't- you want me to..destroy Mario? What about Toad and
Daisy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What about them?&quot; Iggy asked with rising indignation.</p>
<p>&quot;That's what I mean. Everything's about war now, but what are
we doing about that problem? They're just gonna die too?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Larry. Where are you going with this all? This is a command
straight from Kamek so-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I REFUSE!&quot; The music inside cut up again, louder than
it was before. Iggy stood speechless as Z was finally unable to hold
back laughter.</p>
<p>Iggy turned to him sharply. &quot;What the heck, Z?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Teenagers, huh?&quot; Z teased.</p>
<p>Iggy nudged him. &quot;Cut it out. Now what? There's technically
no 'third in command'!&quot;</p>
<p>Z looked at Iggy a weird way and smiled. &quot;There is now&hellip;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Larry doesn't believe. He's clearly a traitor like Ludwig,
hehe.&quot;</p>
<p>Iggy crossed his arms. &quot;You listen here! Ludwig said in the
note that he was 'retrieving Junior from the cursed clutches of
Mario'. Why would you blab that nonsense?!&quot;</p>
<p>Z moved farther down the hall, away from Larry's room, and
beckoned Iggy near. &quot;Do you know the things Ludwig does on his
phone in private?&quot; he asked slyly.</p>
<p>Iggy's scowl changed to a perplexed look. &quot;Uh, you mean thing
things or...<em>those</em> kinds of things because I'm not about to
go there!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I mean...You and him made the Mushroom Flu virus, right?
Mario's friends are racking their brains over finding a cure. Why
exactly is a cure so hard to find?&quot;</p>
<p>Iggy scratched his chin. &quot;Well..&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is it not because the original strand was eradicated and
this strand was made in your lab? Would not a cure need to be reverse
engineered by scratch? Who would be able to do this other than the
Special World Hospital, the most advanced hospital around? What if
Ludwig has been talking to them?&quot;</p>
<p>Iggy took a step back. &quot;You...No way. He wouldn't sabotage us
like that!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Believe it, Iggy. And there are more traitors in the castle.
Wendy has been, shall I say 'busy' on social media lately, hehe. She
even tried to reveal things she shouldn't to Bowser before our King
joined us. I don't even need to go into what Junior did before he ran
in the first place!&quot;</p>
<p>Iggy took off his glasses and wiped them, then put them back on.
&quot;...I must be off my meds. How do you even know this stuff?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm a great spy. <em>One of the best</em>. You should join
me- er us- I mean...you should lead the army! You're a genius and yet
you get nothing aside from the casual mention of being Ludwig's
'lunatic sidekick'. I've always looked up to you. I just want to help
you be the best you can be.&quot;</p>
<p>A smile slowly creep on Iggy's face. &quot;Let's talk to gramps.
Oh boy, I might get to command my first army!&quot; Iggy skipped back
towards the kitchen and Z followed, holding back laughter again.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>&quot;Yes honey. Things are rough, but it'll be okay because we
have Mario on the case...&quot; Yoshi felt like he'd said those words
before... He sat in the nearly empty Mushroom Hospital East cafe,
where he'd been catered for free.</p>
<p>Toadette approached the dinosaur and dropped the Yoshi Berry on
the table in front of him. Yoshi nodded appreciatively as he hung up
with his girlfriend.</p>
<p>&quot;She alright?&quot; Toadette asked.</p>
<p>Yoshi smiled weakly. &quot;Why wouldn't she be? She isn't caught
up in the drama we're in, and she didn't even know about FungusUp.
Apparently no one has even gotten sick in the world of Subcon.&quot;</p>
<p>Toadette plopped down across from him and sat down her half
drunken shroom shake, the third one she'd chugged. &quot;Good for
them. So I interrogated Mr. Mole some more and I finally got
something thanks to the King's guard, specifically the one who came
here with our majesty.&quot;</p>
<p>Yoshi leaned up attentively. &quot;Uh huh, and?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He admitted that the boo didn't just possess him randomly,
which we already knew. The Boo cornered him or something. Said he was
'Z' and from Donut Plains like him. He wouldn't reveal the whole
plan, he just wanted Mario dead and to use him as an instrument for
that. He only agree to go with him cause he appealed to his ego or
something, saying he was a fan or such evil nonsense.&quot; Toadette
chugged down the rest of her shake.</p>
<p>Yoshi hummed. &quot;That's a lot of info when he was shut up like
a clam before. How'd you get him to spill the beans?&quot;</p>
<p>Toadette shrugged. &quot;It wasn't really me, it was the guard.
The King's life was at stake so of course he knew the right way to
approach this.&quot;</p>
<p>Yoshi frowned. &quot;...Did you <em>beat</em> him?&quot;</p>
<p>Toadette froze up. &quot;Uh...I didn't lay a hand on him, but-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wow...&quot; Yoshi muttered with so much disappointment,
Toadette cringed a little. &quot;Listen, don't think I kiss up to
Mario just because he's Mario. Even if he can be boneheaded his
leadership tends to keep us in the right direction. And keep us from
doing...that!&quot;</p>
<p>Toadette scoffed. &quot;Yeah?! But he's not here and Peach isn't
and Mr. Toadsworth isn't and Toad definitely isn't so I'm kind of the
leader now, okay? I'm just trying to be a 'dangerous mushroom' like
Toad would be if he was still around.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You don't say?&quot; Yoshi agreed, dropping it. &quot;Well,
have you heard from Buckenberry?&quot;</p>
<p>Toadette sunk back in the chair, her choleric mood disappearing
with the shroom shake can she lazily tossed on the floor. &quot;Nope.
He has to be alright though. He has to be&hellip;&quot;</p>
<p>They were quiet for a moment until Yoshi glanced at the time
again. &quot;Hey, since we know where Toad and Daisy are, you want to
see them? I can wrap up this berry to go.&quot;</p>
<p>Toadette shook her head. &quot;The guard. Sorry...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I understand,&quot; Yoshi lied, &quot;I'll check it out.
Anything bad happens, call me.&quot; Yoshi was heading towards the
cafeteria exit when he turned around quickly. &quot;Hey, Toadette.
Where is James being held again?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A makeshift prison or sorts in room 333. They wanted to keep
him here so if the King...well anyway they want him around so they
can quickly arrest him and try him at Poshley Hights for murder if it
gets to that.&quot;</p>
<p>Those words struck Yoshi like a thundercloud. &quot;...But he's
clearly not the cause of this! Didn't you explain that?!&quot;</p>
<p>Toadette opened her fourth shroom shake. &quot;Yeah. You wanna try
too?&quot; she groaned.</p>
<p>Yoshi gave her another disappointing look. Toadette felt she would
be getting that a lot now...</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>Wendy was sneaking around the halls trying to avoid anything and
anyone. Just as she rounded a corner she heard people approaching and
sprang back. She peeped around to see Iggy skipping around like an
excited maniac as Kamek stomped along with him in a rage. When she
realized they were heading to Bowser's throne room, she gasped.</p>
<p>&quot;I know right? The end is approaching, hehe.&quot; Z
remarked.</p>
<p>Wendy backed up against the wall, words escaping her.</p>
<p>&quot;How do you like being a princess?&quot; Z asked.</p>
<p>&quot;W-what do you want?!&quot; she shrieked.</p>
<p>&quot;It's me, the garbage collector. Please take me out of here.
I just want to go shopping!&quot;</p>
<p>Wendy cocked her head. &quot;Umm, that's what you want, sugar? You
know we just can't leave when we're at war!&quot;</p>
<p>Z held his hands together. &quot;But please! I know you know about
the best shops!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I do.. and I haven't there since my stolen credit card was
canceled. Wait. Not to be offensive, but what does a Boo like you
shop for anyway?&quot;</p>
<p>Z smiled slyly. &quot;A lot of stuff. There's more to us than
normal people know. Like for example we have-&quot; Z covered his
mouth quickly.</p>
<p>Feeling clever, Wendy wagged her finger. &quot;Say no more. I have
Boo friends on Tumblr, so I know the struggles and oppression that
happens to your species. Well, I guess you do deserve some fun, being
the garbage collector and all..&quot;</p>
<p>Z hugged Wendy tightly. &quot;Oh, thank you so much, hehe! Toad
Town, here we go!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sugar, wait!&quot; She gently pushed him away. &quot;Toad
Town doesn't have anything but trashy city people stuff. If we want
classy, we visit the mall in Poshley Heights, where my Instagram
friend Toodles lives.&quot;</p>
<p>Z's face twisted in annoyance. &quot;But I like Toad Town! That's
where Mario is!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh?&quot; Wendy gasped. &quot;Wait, so Mario isn't on his
way here? But our Lakitu squad reported <em>someone</em> heading our
way, who is that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, never mind that.&quot;</p>
<p>Wendy inched away. &quot;I...need to speak with King Daddy&hellip;&quot;</p>
<p>Z floated alongside her. &quot;No, you don't! That was a mistake.
Of course Mario is heading here. It's always Mario. Who else could it
be, Luigi?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who?&quot; Wendy asked. She was now gaining ground on the
red engraved door to Bowser's throne room.</p>
<p>&quot;Wendy, please. <em>You might regret-</em>&quot;</p>
<p>Wendy burst open the doors to reveal Iggy and Kamek standing
before Bowser, who lazily sat with a coffee in one hand and a
paperback copy of &quot;<em>Pride and Prejudice</em>&quot; in the
other.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure, alright. Lead the army..&quot; Bowser sighed out,
noticing Wendy and Z, but not commenting on it.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you thank you thank you!&quot; Iggy bent down and
started kissing Bowser's feet, to no response from the Koopa King who
was occupied with his book.</p>
<p>Kamek cackled madly. &quot;And I will handle these traitors, my
Lord and son. Speaking of which..&quot; Kamek eyed Wendy as she
shuffled forward.</p>
<p>&quot;What's up, doll?&quot; Bowser asked, some amount of life
returning to his voice.</p>
<p>&quot;Daddy? Did you know that Mario isn't actually on his way
here?&quot;</p>
<p>Kamek and Iggy gasped.</p>
<p>Bowser sat up. &quot;What?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Z said he was in Toad Town!&quot; Wendy pointed a claw
at the dark boo, forcing him to step up.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe I saw him in passing. But he could be on his way now,
hehe!&quot; Z shot a devilish look at Wendy that everyone seemed to
miss.</p>
<p>Bowser sat the book down and stood up. &quot;No, someone's clearly
on their way fixing for a fight. The scouting Lakitu in Water Land
have spoken. Hmm, well that's bonkers! X, you scram for a moment. I
need to speak family business.&quot;</p>
<p>Iggy ran up behind Z and put an arm around him. &quot;First of
all, it's 'Z' dad. Second, he's with us now, ain't that right?&quot;</p>
<p>Z nodded slowly, a mischievous grin creeping up on his face.</p>
<p>Kamek glanced back at Z fondly. &quot;I must agree with Prince
Iggy, your nastiness. After all, was it not he that gave us our
winning idea for domination? You will still cooperate, yes?&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser sat back down, a little dazed. &quot;Right...So, those
traitors&hellip;&quot;</p>
<p>Iggy cleared his throat. &quot;Excuse me King Dad, but Wendy is
one of them! She-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;-Well whatever she's done, she's also told us important
info!&quot; Bowser bellowed. &quot;The dungeon, but THAT'S IT. What
are you waiting for? You and er...boo guy go do that and then you
lead the army or whatever! That's an order!&quot;</p>
<p>Impressed with Bowser's tone, Iggy and Z complied immediately.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait, daddy! No!&quot; Wendy cried as she was lead away. The
moment the doors shut, Kamek gave Bowser the warmest look he had in a
long time.</p>
<p>&quot;I was indeed wrong about you, my son.&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser had buried his face into his book again. &quot;How so,
pops?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was so certain you weren't really with us, but now I see.
You are truly our worthy king&hellip;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh huh. Tell me about Y. I've hardly knew him being that he
usually stays in the garbage room, but now he's all around this
castle, and y'all love him like family!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You mean Z, your wickedness? He is indeed a garbage
collector but-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Full name?&quot; Bowser interrupted. &quot;I'm out of touch
with our hiring agency, so I'm curious.&quot;</p>
<p>Kamek's eyes focused on that book that was glued to Bowser's face.
&quot;I have done research out of curiosity as well. I believe it's
'Zoo Diddley'. Early twenties. He is from Donut Plains, and has a
common boo last name and lineage. I believe our hiring agency took
him on a year ago. Further questions, my lord?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And he came up with this plan? I mean, it's a good one of
course, don't get me wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I received anonymous inspiration, then I spoke with the now
fallen Prince Ludwig to put it in motion. Do forgive us for doing
this behind your back, my son. Later, it came to my attention that Z
wrote me the note, detailing the plan. To think, villain masterminds
get younger and younger!&quot; Kamek's hands shook in excitement.</p>
<p>Bowser waved one claw. &quot;...Thanks, pops. See ya around. I
need to, uh prepare myself for whomever I'm gonna fight.&quot;</p>
<p>Kamek bowed respectfully. &quot;Good day, sir. Oh, and one more
thing. How are you enjoying '<em>Pride and Prejudice'</em>?&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser carefully pulled the book away from his face. &quot;It's a
classic. We could even learn a thing or two from it.&quot;</p>
<p>Kamek hacked with laughter as he left. Bowser then sat the book
completely down, revealing his cellphone hidden inside the pages.
Bowser opened the web browser and typed away.</p>
<p><strong>To be continued...</strong></p>
<p><strong>Author note: Yes, this chapter has a slight retcon of how
Z the Dark Boo gets involved. I wont be editing older chapters,
because a rewrite is needed anyway. Don't worry though. I will be

<p>Jelectro Bond and Kylie Koopa entered a Mushroom Press buzzing
with activity. After his outburst at the Toadley Clinic, they'd been
quiet ever since, Bond's body seemingly running on autopilot and
Kylie too unnerved to question it.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello? How can I help you?!&quot; the front desk
receptionist yelled over the loud arguments the reporters and writers
seemed to be having.</p>
<p>Bond ignored her and made way for the office cubicles and straight
to Mitch, were it was quieter.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, hello there,&quot; Mitch greeted in a low voice.</p>
<p>&quot;Mon ami...&quot; Bond stared blankly.</p>
<p>Mitch stared back. &quot;...Aww man! You mean my whole report is
wrong?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, but you can write your report later. Tell me, what do
you see?&quot;</p>
<p>Mitch swiveled the chair from side to side, stalling time. &quot;Can't
you tell? I got nothing. I can't help you... Mr. Jelectro Bond.&quot;</p>
<p>Bond shook his head. &quot;Of course. You are not seeing it, yet
you have seen it before. How?...You are able to block your powers?&quot;</p>
<p>Kylie walked up to them. &quot;Umm. Hello?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your boyfriend's a man on a mission, isn't he?&quot; Mitch
teased.</p>
<p>Kylie's eye twitched. &quot;Can't you see how serious this is
right now, bud?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well duh. I see a bit of everything right now, but Jelectro
here wants more insight on something <em>he</em> saw.&quot;</p>
<p>Kylie turned to Bond. &quot;What didja see anyway?&quot;</p>
<p>Bond hesitated. &quot;You know how we have said that Bowser is
innocent all along? Yet I saw someone on the throne laughing
maniacally over others. There was much dark smoke. Very much!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Like a fire burnin?&quot; Kylie jotted this down in her
notebook.</p>
<p>&quot;No, darling. Something was strange about that smoke. It was
like I was there. Utterly terrifying.&quot; Bond turned to Kylie
sentimentally. &quot;Forgive me for the silent treatment, my love.&quot;</p>
<p>Mitch cleared his throat loudly. &quot;Hey love birds, I do have
something after all. When James was in here this morning, I got a bit
of something. Like someone was hanging around the block. Someone like
us&hellip;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Us? You mean Bond and you? Wait, why is that a big deal?&quot;
Kylie asked.</p>
<p>Mitch crossed his arms. &quot;I only know of myself, a Whomp
living in the Beanbean Kingdom, a Crazee Dayzee in Rogueport, a Koopa
from the Waffle Kingdom, and a Mouser from Subcon with this gift. And
believe me, I've been searching.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, mon ami, some of us keep such things a secret. I
myself did until yesterday. Do not be so sure of yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, yeah, I guess so,&quot; Mitch muttered humbly. &quot;So,
is that all you wanted? Wait...it isn't. You want me to-? No, screw
you!&quot;</p>
<p>Kylie put her pen and paper down in disgust. &quot;Ya'll gotta
stop with these mental conversations. What's the plan?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He needs to come with us because things are changing
quickly. Whomever he sensed has connections with the black smoke I
saw. I just feel it. I almost never have such contradictory visions a
day apart. Did not something monstrous happen to James after his
departure from here?&quot;</p>
<p>Mitch shrugged again. &quot;Did it? Well, yeah, I know now because
I read it from you, but don't assume I knew before. I work without
interruptions from whatever drama Mario and the rest are in.&quot;</p>
<p>Kylie gestured towards Mitch. &quot;See, Bond? This is why this
little jerk can't work with us. By the way, Wiggs just texted me that
he and Richard are going to Giant Land, so I guess that's one thread
out of the way.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wait, you're on a mission NOW?&quot; Mitch asked, baffled.</p>
<p>Kylie found her eye twitching again. &quot;Duh! Didn't ya read it
from me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No. I've learned to suppress that a lot. Besides, reading an
ex is too lowbrow for me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yet, you read Bond the moment he met you?!&quot;</p>
<p>Mitch smirked, though Kylie detected a hint of embarrassment.
&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>
<p>Kylie was about to punch him before Bond intervened. &quot;Will
you assist, mon ami? You are a reporter, a good one, you want to rise
above with more intellectual articles but you are afraid that that
will alienate your large but unchallenged fanbase. You write
confessions all of the time on Tumblr-&quot;</p>
<p>Mitch stood up. &quot;Okay, okay! Er, so it's the Toadley Clinic,
right? Ugh. I don't want to read that creep by accident...Oh, cool.
You have a 2017 Aston Mushroom waiting outside?...Wow, you spilt
coffee in the back seat and never cleaned it up?&quot; Mitch
continued to muse rapid fire as he grabbed his coat and left his
office space. Bond followed close behind and Kylie too, until a
sudden thought made her freeze.</p>
<p>Mitch seemed to have his powers under control, unless he dealt
with Bond. That sounded familiar. Now what was the thing Bond said
back at Peach's Castle that could affect their powers?</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>&quot;More peanuts?&quot; the attendant asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, sure.&quot; Mario received the plastic wrapped protein
from her, but he didn't open them yet.</p>
<p>Mario shifted in his seat for the tenth time. Despite being
leather first class seats, they didn't prevent one's buttocks from
becoming numb like any other seat after a period of time. Peach's
head gently leaned on Mario's shoulder as she took a 'quick nap'.
Getting up to stretch ones legs wasn't an option, or at least not a
polite one. Mario glanced over at the Koopa prince who sat on the
other side of him, and observed how he'd already reached the sixth
world in &quot;New Super Mario Bros. 2&quot;.</p>
<p>Mario got bored staring through the windows, so he reflected. He'd
never felt like he was doing so much yet so little. His brother was
actually out there brawling, yet he was here with&hellip;</p>
<p>...Mario didn't want to think of his royal companions rudely, but
he was a man of action, not one of negotiating with whatever the
Special World Hospital doctors were like. Maybe Prince Ludwig,
whatever his true intentions were, could at least explain the medical
jargon that would undoubtedly fly. Mario's mind stayed on this until
the blonde next to him stirred.</p>
<p>&quot;Mario?&quot; Peach asked softly, her voice muffled slightly
by Mario's shoulder.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Princess?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's Peach silly!&quot; Peach giggled. &quot;We there yet?&quot;</p>
<p>Mario glanced at the digital clock above the door to the cockpit.
&quot;Should be close. It's been an hour...Wanna snack?&quot; Mario
handed her the peanuts, which made her finally set up in her seat.</p>
<p>&quot;You're always so thoughtful, Mario. Teehee!&quot;</p>
<p>Mario was secretly glad she'd got off him. Now he could move
around and relieve his stiffness. And pee.</p>
<p>&quot;Woohoo!&quot; Junior closed his 3DS triumphantly. &quot;Beat
that world! It's weird beating up my own family in a videogame, but
that's kind of what we're doing now, right Mario?&quot;</p>
<p>Mario was twisting the crook out of his back. &quot;Huh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Like that's what King daddy said. Us against them, huh,
right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe they aren't that mad at you. Ludwig wants to take you
home.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?! You didn't tell me that! But I wanna have adventures!
They're gonna make gramps babysit me all day and it'll be soooo
boring!&quot;</p>
<p>Mario and Peach gave each other a knowing glance. This was exactly
why they didn't tell Junior.</p>
<p>&quot;ATTENTION PASSENGERS: TAKE YOUR SEATS. WE WILL BE LANDING
MOMENTARILY.&quot; The intercom announced.</p>
<p>So far for Mario stretching his legs, he thought. He leaned over
to whisper to Peach. &quot;Thanks again for doing this for me. It
would have taken all day otherwise.&quot;</p>
<p>A touch of color appeared on her cheeks. &quot;Oh, anything for
you. You know it's no problem to get top notch transportation for a
princess. I just hope they can help my poor daddy..&quot;</p>
<p>Mario stepped off of the personal plane and was frozen momentarily
by how beautiful Star Road looked. The sky was a deep blue, and stars
lit every part of it like a constant light show. The ground was
naturally powder blue colored, ostensibly like another planet
altogether. Peach came up behind him while holding Junior's hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Beautiful, isn't it?&quot; she whispered. Mario nodded.</p>
<p>Now was the moment of Mario was anxious about. After quick
refreshments at the airport, they wasted no time hitching a ride to
the <em>International Medical University of Special World</em>,
nicknamed the dreaded 'Special World Hospital'.</p>
<p>The taxi sped off the moment Mario, Peach, and Junior exited, its
smoke trail making them have to fan the air.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, *cough* this sure is a place!&quot; Mario remarked.</p>
<p>The titular hospital was at least eight stories and of a boxy
modern style. The exterior was lined with silver panels that
reflected the starry sky beautifully, but provided no clues as to
what was inside, since all windows were tinted dark. There was also
no public entrance for visitors, just a large sliding door. The
building's affectionate name being a misnomer of sorts, this was more
of a research facility outside of special cases. That's why patients
tended not to leave. Possibly because 'test subjects' would be the
more appropriate term.</p>
<p>Mario buzzed and waited a moment. Junior got bored after thirty
seconds and went back to playing games. Peach put her hand on her
hip. Mario buzzed again and again for five minutes.</p>
<p>&quot;They might answer to me,&quot; a deep German accented voice
said from behind everyone.</p>
<p>They turned to face Ludwig who seemingly materialized on the empty
road. He wore a black jacket and a white buttoned undershirt with a
large leather satchel strapped on.</p>
<p>Mario scanned the horizon. &quot;I didn't hear your taxi.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I walked from a station down the block.&quot; While
excellent looking, Mario detected an element of unease in his manner.
Ludwig unceremoniously walked past everyone and buzzed.</p>
<p>&quot;Code please?&quot; came from the speaker almost immediately.</p>
<p>Ludwig leaned in and whispered something into the mic.</p>
<p>&quot;Accepted.&quot; The metal sliding door lifted to reveal a
brightly lit hallway.</p>
<p>Ludwig glanced back. &quot;Well? Shall we enter?&quot;</p>
<p>Ludwig lead the way and seemed to know exactly where he was going.
Mario, Peach, and Junior were too distracted by the bright identical
looking hallways to do much of anything other than gawk and follow
along.</p>
<p>Ludwig pushed open a door with a long number code written on it.
&quot;This is for me and Mario only. Peach, watch Junior.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's Princess Peach to you and, excuse me? I came with Mario
to be useful!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are useful by watching Junior. You won't get kidnapped,
I promise.&quot; Ludwig remarked with calculated brutality.</p>
<p>Mario stepped between them. &quot;Ludwig, knock it off. You'd
better explain all this!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We will. I would not have even let you come pass this point,
but you probably have inside info we might need to hear. Do not screw
this up.&quot; Mario and the rest begrudgingly obeyed the Koopa
Prince's orders.</p>
<p>Mario followed Ludwig into another corridor and finally into a
room where a board meeting was taking place with five doctors seated
at a glass table and a person standing.</p>
<p>Seated closest to him was a retired X-Naut PhD, or Mario hoped he
was considering what X-nauts stood for. Next to him, a goose named Dr
Sigmund Shrinkasaurus, the self-proclaimed nose, foot, elbow, and
brain specialist. Across from him, was Dr. Toad, the guy always being
overshadowed by Dr. Toadley and a company founder. Next to him, Dr
Topper, the hammer bro puzzle specialist who also had a degree in
psychology. At the far end of the table however were two people who
made Mario's eyes almost pop out of his head.</p>
<p>&quot;Doctor Mario?...And Metal Mario?!&quot;</p>
<p>Dr. Mario sat, genial but aged. His doctor coat was white and
clean but hastily put on. He even had a few grey hairs visable in his
hairline. The metallic Mario inexplicably stood behind him in a close
protective way and he gave Mario a disgruntled look.</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry you had to see this, old buddy! He's been with me
since the <em>accident </em>and I can't shake em'! So what's with
you?&quot; Doctor Mario asked heartily.</p>
<p>&quot;Too much to go into now,&quot; Mario's words came out in a
jumble, &quot;Toad and Daisy in particular have been sick for two
days now so I know there can't be much more time left!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well why didn't you say so?&quot; Dr. Mario gasped.</p>
<p>&quot;Umm, I did in the letter. Wait, how did you even get it so
soon?&quot;</p>
<p>Doctor Mario facepalmed. &quot;Oh, that! Parakarry first class.
Boy was he shocked at the players we have at Smash Mansion now.
Especially Bayonetta... Well anyway, he said that The Postmaster
called from the hospital and said it was of dire importance. I got my
old sorry behind off of Smash Mansion's wonderful couches and took
off. Now, let's get started. I just need my lab and my equipment and
a good night's sleep and-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Doc,&quot; Mario interrupted,&quot;your lab was rented out
since you left us. In fact, you're the one who gave up the lease!&quot;</p>
<p>Doctor Mario blinked a few times. &quot;Of course! I knew that
too...&quot;</p>
<p>Mario was about to speak again when Dr. Topper tapped one of his
hammers on the table, prompting a vexing look from Dr. Toad. &quot;Can
we get started?&quot; Dr. Topper asked.&quot; I assume you are not
here to waste time, Ludwig?&quot;</p>
<p>Ludwig took a seat. &quot;Of course not. I have brought the
samples as well.&quot; Ludwig opened his bag and pulled out a can of
FungusUp. He slid it to the middle of the table for observation.</p>
<p>&quot;Aye, this be the best drink of old!&quot; cried Dr.
Shrinkasaurus in a thick accent.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes allegedly,&quot; the X-naut scribbled down some notes.
&quot;But surely that's stale now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Correct. This is the method of deployment. Extremity of
dosage depends on amount consumed. You see, as we speak I believe a
number are sick but we can assume that they did not consume the
entire drink because they only seem to suffer negative symptoms. All
except Toad and Daisy, who have shown positive symptoms as can be
verified by Dr. Toadley. Where is he anyway?&quot; Ludwig glanced at
the monitor on the wall which only showed static.</p>
<p>Dr. Toad got up to cut it off. &quot;He refused our Skype call. He
won't be joining this discussion I'm afraid.&quot;</p>
<p>Mario finally sat down in the chair nearest to Doctor Mario and
his friend. &quot;So none of us are gonna question why Ludwig, who
just admitted to creating this virus, is here trying to discuss it
with us?&quot;</p>
<p>Ludwig sighed. &quot;I did not admit to that yet, but I guess I
will now. I used Dr. Mario's cure as a reference, even studying his
notes, then I created the germs synthetically through some reverse
engineering trickery. That is why I called this meeting. We shall
have to reverse engineer my reverse engineering to avoid
catastrophe.&quot;</p>
<p>This was news to Mario. So just having Dr. Mario on the case
wasn't enough after all?</p>
<p>Dr. Toad nodded as he picked up the FungusUp can curiously. &quot;I
understand. Marvelous work, the untrained eye would never notice how
it's been clearly tampered with. It would have been nice to have an
actual patient here but I suppose we can manage something. I'm not
pulling a night shift again, you'd better believe me.&quot;</p>
<p>Mario looked at Dr. Toad appallingly. He needed some snark in his
life, not cynicism!</p>
<p>Dr. Mario stood up. &quot;Wonderful, to the lab! Your lab I mean,
because mine is gone now apparently,&quot; he said playfully.</p>
<p>Mario gave him the most incredulous look. &quot;You're okay with
what he just said?!&quot;</p>
<p>Dr. Mario chuckled. &quot;Hey, I'm just glad someone found my
scribbles useful. Don't give me that look. Your friends will be
alright, and I know Ludwig's a bad guy. It's just sometimes you gotta
partner with the villain! You should know all about that!&quot;</p>
<p>Mario shook his head. He wasn't ready for that much
self-reflection.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>Wiggletron stood before a warp pipe located in a secluded spot in
Forever Forest. They had to trek at least forty minutes to find it,
but taking it would save one hours at the least.</p>
<p>&quot;So this is the most expedient method of travel to Giant
Land?&quot;</p>
<p>Richard looked at him earnestly. &quot;Wiggs, cut the act! We're
alone now!&quot;</p>
<p>Wiggs smiled. &quot;Indeed. It is time we had more of that.&quot;</p>
<p>Dick chuckled. &quot;Got that right. It's like all of our friends
are weirdos now. Uh, well let's do this. You stick close to me, I
don't wanna get jumped once we hit the streets. Giant people, giant
thugs&hellip;&quot;</p>
<p>After a short trip, they were in Giant Land again albeit off in
the woods. Dick lead the way back to civilization, ever paranoid over
every sound or twig snap. Wiggs was at his heels but the beautiful
scenery reduced him to that of a tourist too enamored with their
surroundings to speak. Finally they found a clearance to a community
but Dick ran up to the side of a cabin immediately. He peeked around
to watch the road with dread in his face.</p>
<p>&quot;Wiggs, you uh...My dad's house is the one with the red roof
just down there a few blocks. Just have Loogi or whoever met me
here,&quot; he plead.</p>
<p>Wiggs stepped onto the dirt road and glanced around as if some
danger lurked. He shrugged after a moment of inactivity. &quot;You
cannot be serious with me at this current time&hellip;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Please! I just can't be seen in the streets. Listen, I'll
take you out for dinner later for the favor.&quot;</p>
<p>Wiggs flushed. &quot;Uh, what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You know, like how you were gonna do for breakfast at Club
64?...You okay?&quot;</p>
<p>Wiggs unfroze. &quot;Ah, that...Affirmative.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Meanwhile&hellip;</strong></p>
<p>Luigi counted out the powerups again to give himself something to
do. Six mushrooms, three fire flowers, a cape feather, two tanookis,
and one starman, the same as before. He sat on Richard Sr.'s porch,
along with Boo, while Alagold was inside with the doctor. While it
had still been less than an hour, every minute was another moment
Luigi was tempted to look for this mystical warp on his own.</p>
<p>&quot;Weegee,&quot; Boo asked, &quot;wanna play a game again?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nah. Just gotta keep on guard,&quot; Luigi groaned.</p>
<p>Boo prodded him playfully. &quot;I know. But can't we do something
fun?&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi turned to Boo, not realizing until then that he was frowning
in the first place.&quot;I...you're right. Boo, you're always
noticing when something's wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry..&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;-No no. I mean in a good way. You gotta have a buddy
sometimes to keep you in check. So what were you thinking?&quot;</p>
<p>Boo handed Luigi their phone to his surprise. On it was &quot;Minecraft
PE&quot;.</p>
<p>Luigi burst out laughing once he saw that Boo had made an
impressive statue of his Super Mario World sprite along with plenty
of other giant recreations of his friends and family. &quot;Boo&hellip;.you're
awesome..</p>
<p>&quot;Know what else is awesome, hehe? Look!&quot; Boo pointed to
a tall Wiggler approaching.</p>
<p>Luigi handed the phone back over and sprang up. &quot;Think this
is our help? He does seem to be heading straight for us. Get
Alagold!&quot;</p>
<p>Boo did so as Luigi walked forward to meet his guest.</p>
<p>&quot;Luigi Mario?&quot; Wiggletron droned.</p>
<p>Luigi offered his hand. &quot;Yes? Uh, I didn't think our guide
would be a- Nevermind. So you know what's going on, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Affirmative...Is this really the abode of Richard's father?&quot;
Wiggs asked, his eyes fixed on the house with sudden interest.</p>
<p>Alagold, Boo, and Richard Sr. exited the house and met Luigi.
Richard Sr, who now wore a green camouflage jacket, scrutinized Wiggs
closely. &quot;I knew Dick wouldn't show. What are you to him? You
gotta be close because he wouldn't trust anyone otherwise. So how is
he-&quot;</p>
<p>Alagold pointed at the sky. &quot;Look!&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi squinted at the sky to see two Lakitu scanning the ground
below.</p>
<p>&quot;Are we under attack?!&quot; Boo asked.</p>
<p>Luigi dropped the powerup bag to the ground and started digging in
it. &quot;I don't think they'd be here for a vacation. We have to
take them down before they-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Too late..&quot; Alagold moaned.</p>
<p>The Lakitu spotted the five and stopped straight above them. They
hovered close enough to be in range of attack but far away enough to
be hard to reach, their usual cowardly but effective method. The
Lakitu hailed spiny eggs down causing everyone to scatter.</p>
<p>&quot;The heck?! These are Bowser goons!&quot; Richard yelled as
he ducked for his porch.</p>
<p>&quot;Yep!&quot; Luigi grabbed a Tanooki suit. &quot;Wiggler guy,
stick with the doc! We'll handle this!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I believe can be of assist-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do it!&quot; Luigi begged. Wiggs did so reluctantly.</p>
<p>Luigi then tossed the powerup bag to Alagold, who had fled to the
left side of Richard's house. Alagold grabbed a fire flower out but
went around the back of Richard's house for some reason. Luigi took a
running start to achieve temporary flight, avoiding the spiny
barrage. His efforts failed as but both Lakitu skillfully dodged the
admittedly slow flight speed of the Tanooki.</p>
<p>Boo called over to Luigi once he landed. &quot;Come over here, I
have an idea!&quot; Luigi made a mad dash for Boo, narrowing avoiding
damage.</p>
<p>Boo grabbed his arm. &quot;Okay, do that running jumping thing
again!&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi made another running start with Boo running with him. Luigi
curiously noticed that the Lakitu stopped with their spiny throwing
and now patrolled around Richard's house from above. His feet left
the ground with Boo hanging on and he went for the closest Lakitu,
knocking him straight out of the sky with ease. His cloud disappeared
as he fell to the ground, making his partner gawk and curse. Luigi
landed on the roof, just in time to find Fire Alagold.</p>
<p>&quot;How'd you get up here?&quot; Luigi asked, astonished.</p>
<p>&quot;The doctor told me a story back in the house. He was gonna
install solar panels on the roof but was too fat for the ladder, but
he never removed the ladder from the back and-&quot; Alagold looked
around in a panic. &quot;Wait, who's talking?&quot;</p>
<p>Boo let Luigi's arm go. &quot;We were invisible then, hehe!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There you are!&quot; the remaining Lakitu called from above.</p>
<p>Alagold hopped off of Luigi's head to shoot a fireball at his
level. The Lakitu dodged and instead of attacking, he pulled out a
radio.</p>
<p>&quot;Heroes identified in Giant Land. They are- hey, what the?&quot;
His radio was snatched out of his hand by an invisible force. He
reached for it but it jerked away. He tried it again but it did the
same.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>BOOOOOOOOOOO</em>!&quot; Boo howled making the Lakitu
shriek and flee. He disappeared in the distance in a matter of
seconds. Boo became visible again and tossed the radio to Luigi who
pocketed it satisfactorily. They both smiled awkwardly for a few
seconds.</p>
<p>&quot;..Good job, boo. Let's get back with our guide and scram,
that Lakitu can still identify us when he makes it back to Bowser.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But he'll have to change his cloud first!&quot; Alagold
teased.</p>
<p>&quot;Ugh. Thanks for that imagery...Wonder what happened to the
other?&quot;</p>
<p>That question was answered when they got off of the roof to find
Wiggs on the porch holding the first Lakitu in his iron grip, with a
cage designed for a small animal nearby. Richard Sr. was right there
with him, mercilessly interrogating the Lakitu, who feared for his
life.</p>
<p>Luigi nodded impressively. &quot;Whoa! Good job also Mr&hellip;.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wiggletron,&quot; Wiggs answered with a smile. &quot;The
perpetrator attempted to flee the scene before I intervened.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, and he's gonna tell us everything!&quot; Richard Sr.
answered. &quot;I suggest a beat down, old school style!&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi held his hands up. &quot;Actually, there isn't much for him
to tell us. We need to bust Bowser. It's as simple as that. To
problem now is how are we gonna let him go. These were clearly
scouting Lakitu so if Bowser is so interested in exactly what we're
doing, there has to be a reason&hellip;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you all not aware of the conspiracy?&quot; Wiggs asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Does it matter? Our mission is clear,&quot; Luigi replied, a
bit of annoyance creeping into his tone as he was suddenly reminded
of the situation with Buckenberry and Yoshi.</p>
<p>&quot;Right, so we can beat him now. I know some local ruffians
who-&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi waved his arms around. &quot;No beating! Don't you have a
jail or something, Doctor?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can I say something?&quot; the Lakitu choked out.</p>
<p>&quot;No!&quot; said everyone.</p>
<p>&quot;Eh, fine. We have a community jail he can go to. Wow, you
city folk are something else&hellip;&quot; Richard Sr. muttered.
&quot;Leave the Lakitu to me. Ya'll mosey on out and tell Dick I
asked about him, okay?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Affirmative. You remind me so much of Richard. Or my Richard
rather&hellip;&quot; Wiggs dropped the Lakitu in the cage as if he
was a small yapping dog. He incidentally noticed something in
Richard's jacket pocket. &quot;What is that?&quot;</p>
<p>Richard Sr. looked around shiftily. &quot;What is what?&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi was looking into the power up bag for another count when he
noticed something. &quot;<em>Where's that FungusUp</em>?&quot;</p>
<p>Richard Sr. took out the can of soda out of his pocket. &quot;That
was yours?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Nooooo</em>!&quot; Dick ran up to his father and knocked
the FungusUp out of his hands (or the goomba equivalent of that).
&quot;That stuff is poison!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Richard?!&quot; Richard Sr. cried. &quot;Where did you just
come from?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, that's the guy that got knocked out by the door!&quot;
Boo pointed out.</p>
<p>Dick kelp his eyes glued to the ground. &quot;Yeah, yeah. That
drink causes Mushroom Flu or whatever-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?!&quot; everyone minus Wiggs and Dick gasped.</p>
<p>&quot;That is correct, and we have known since this morning,&quot;
Wiggs commented. &quot;I had no idea anyone possessed that item. You
all really are uninformed!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But seriously. Where were you?&quot; Luigi asked, ignoring
Wiggs' point on purpose.</p>
<p>&quot;I saw the whole thing and I crept closer and closer from the
backs of houses. I just couldn't let myself be seen!&quot; Dick
cried. &quot;Not after...you know!&quot;</p>
<p>His father shook his head. &quot;Son, I drove those bullies out
ages ago. No one's gonna mess with us for being Goombas! Was that the
reason you left all along?&quot;</p>
<p>Dick sniffed a bit. &quot;Yeah? They'd get jealous at my mapping
skills and knock me about and stuff&hellip;&quot;</p>
<p>Wiggs patted him on the back. &quot;But you are not in danger any
longer. Is this not wonderful?&quot;</p>
<p>He smiled weakly. &quot;Guess so. Thanks for having my back
anyway.&quot;</p>
<p>Richard Sr. suddenly seemed greatly amused by the two. &quot;Why
don't I show you inside, Wiggs. You'll crack up when you see Dick's
old room.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dad! Cut it out!&quot; Dick whined.</p>
<p>&quot;Excuse me,&quot; Luigi butted in, &quot;but that warp,
please?&quot;</p>
<p>Dick turned towards him. &quot;What is that furry costume supposed
to be? Anyway, that top secret warp to Dark Land that only I know
about? Oh, it was just in the backyard this whole time&hellip;&quot;</p>

<p>Parabilly Koopa took off his straw hat and wiped the sweat from
his brow. If he didn't sow the Bean seeds now, he'd never be able too
once the heat really started. Then of course he still needed to get
the cattle out of the barn and inspected. There was always work to
do. After plowing a few more yards on the farm, he stopped once his
youngest son came fluttering to him from their home.</p>
<p>&quot;Poppa, there be a phone call for ya! Says his name's
Sebastian Bullet. Who's that pa?&quot; the young Paratroopa asked.</p>
<p>Billy dropped the plow in the dirt. &quot;Just 'n old workmate,
Bobby. Get Jim and tell him to pick up where I left.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy stepped inside his and his family's humble home to pick up
the old landline phone.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, this is Parabilly, sir!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Billy,&quot; Sebastian answered relieved, &quot;glad you
made it home safe. I know we didn't leave on the best terms earlier
today, but I just wanted to check on you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh huh,&quot; Billy agreed dryly. &quot;That all?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well that and&hellip;&quot; Sebastian gave a summary of all
the events Billy missed. He concluded by asking how Billy would like
to come back since Jimmy was long gone.</p>
<p>&quot;What? I might have bad nerves but I ain't no fool!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But we could use you here!&quot; Sebastian then whispered,
&quot;Listen, most people seem to be crazy in the Mushroom Kingdom,
even the good guys. It must be something in the water-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I heard that!&quot; Billy heard a feminine voice shout in
the background. Still he was unimpressed.</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry old pal. I don't want that life anymore. Besides,
aside from ma family duties, I'm still needed right here!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm a evenin physician. Always was before meeting y'all.
Gotta feller at 5 pm with a broken leg that needs to be reexamined.
Boy at 7 has a bad cough. Gal at 8 dizzy spells but only after she
eats peanut butter! Don't think I'm not keeping the practice up cause
I ain't zipping round the city like ya!&quot;</p>
<p>Sebastian let those words sink in. &quot;...Alright. Please keep
in touch though, okay? The rest, Richard and Wiggletron, we're all
getting along a lot better with Jimmy gone. Its nothing like it was
before, okay? Well, good bye.&quot; Sebastian hung up as he heard
someone entering the clinic from the front door.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Yoshi stopped at the Toadley Clinic. In a few moments he was
caught up with the latest situation, and enjoying the light
atmosphere of the company of Toadley, Mary, and Sebastian. A stark
contrast to the dread permeating everywhere else.</p>
<p>&quot;So if there were gonna be anymore 'coma walkers' we'd know,
right?&quot; Yoshi asked. He was in the lab with a cautious eye on
Toad and Daisy, who were still awake but in a daze of sorts in their
containment.</p>
<p>Toadley pulled himself away from his game of &quot;<em>Minesweeper</em>&quot;
to face Yoshi from his chair. &quot;Have I concluded that? Yes. Other
patients are mostly at MK Hospital East. What are their symptoms
only? Unconsciousness. There is a special factor in Toad and Daisy's
case. I suspect it relates to dosage. If only I had a sample!&quot;</p>
<p>Yoshi was impressed, but weirded out. Toadley spoke excitingly.
Too excitingly. &quot;Doctor, did you know Mario went to that special
world place with that Koopaling Ludwig?&quot;</p>
<p>Toadley's eyebrows shifted. &quot;Did Toadette Skype me back like
she promised? No!&quot;</p>
<p>Yoshi scratched the back of his neck. &quot;She probably won't.&quot;
He'd refrain from going into detail why. He did want to ruin the mood
with news of lies and interrogation brutality.</p>
<p>Toadley turned back to the computer. &quot;Well anyway, yes I am
aware of some occurrence at the Special World Hospital. They wanted
me to join their banal meeting! My response? Of course not. Such
lunatics.&quot;</p>
<p>Yoshi slowly nodded. For Toadley to think such a thing, it had to
be true. He hoped Mario and the rest were holding up. He even
wondered why he had so much rancor before. Blowing up on him like he
had, just for being friends with Bowser? It was like his emotions
were being amplified then. He also questioned the bad rep of the
clinic. Toadley had enough free time to play on his laptop yet he'd
already figured out everything he could given his circumstances.
Sure, he wore a weird robe and turban, and he wasn't sure what the
lower half of his face looked like under than cloth, but-</p>
<p>Was he actually a good doctor?</p>
<p>&quot;Blown up again!&quot; Toadley cried at his computer screen.
&quot;Must I always be foiled by my landmine planting adversaries?!&quot;</p>
<p>Good yes. But sane? Maybe not.</p>
<p>Just then footsteps were heard from the front of the clinic.</p>
<p>&quot;Where's the doc, so I know where not to go?&quot; a smooth
voice asked from the lobby.</p>
<p>Sebastian, who was in the opposite corner of the lab with various
beakers, leaned up from the microscope he was looking in. &quot;Mitch?&quot;
He left the lab, prompting Yoshi to follow.</p>
<p>&quot;Bonjour, Yoshi,&quot; Jelectro Bond greeted the moment Yoshi
left the lab. &quot;It is always good to have a <em>Mario
representative</em> around.&quot;</p>
<p>Yoshi looked around and saw a green capped Toad talking up Mary at
the front desk to her dismay while Sebastian stood next to him like a
lost puppy. The Koopa reporter he vaguely remembered as Kylie had
plopped down in the waiting chairs with no further introduction and
was reading a magazine. Then he realized that it was the two foot
tall Noki standing before him who had actually spoken.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yeah thanks. I was just here to check on Toad and Daisy
and stuff but I was just leaving.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very well. Be careful, mon ami,&quot; Bond added with sudden
gravity. &quot;I predict...an uncertain future. Please contact us if
anything happens.&quot;</p>
<p>Yoshi stopped before the exit and looked back. &quot;I will. Don't
worry.&quot;</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>The front entrance guard of Peach's Castle glanced up from his
Nintendo DS, but then turned his attention back to the game after
recognizing the blue capped visitor.</p>
<p>Buckenberry stopped before him with shoulders sunk low. &quot;My
phone got broken so where is everyone? What's with the roofing
people?&quot; He asked, his voice barely above a whisper.</p>
<p>&quot;I dunno,&quot; the guard groaned, &quot;look, I'll never
finish &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; at this rate! Stop interrupting.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But...haven't you seen anything?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I see everything here. They don't pay me enough. Who are
you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Buckenberry! I've been here longer than you, you stupid high
school employee!&quot; he responded harshly. He was being teased and
he knew it.</p>
<p>The teenaged guard smirked. &quot;Hmm. Gonna need a last name.
Buckenberry what?&quot;</p>
<p>Buckenberry's fist balled as a sudden anger overtook him. Before
he was aware of his body, he'd thrown a punch square in the Toad
guard's face, knocking him to the ground and making the DS fall and
break in half.</p>
<p>Buckenberry froze at the sight of the Toad writhing in pain from
his nose. &quot;Holy-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;OWWW, you psycho!&quot; the guard cried.</p>
<p>Buckenberry awkwardly stepped around him and entered the castle,
closing the door tightly to drown the guard's further screams. The
purple capped podium Toad saw him enter but was too involved on his
cellphone to care.</p>
<p>&quot;Am I psycho?! I know I can be hotheaded but...&quot;
Buckenberry thought out loud in a moment of clarity.</p>
<p>The other Toad shrugged. &quot;Hey where you've been, hon? You've
missed so much&hellip;&quot; He explained what he knew, which
included the fabricated story from Mario about the roof.</p>
<p>Buckenberry listen carefully. &quot;Uh huh? What what about-&quot;</p>
<p>The podium worker laughed loudly. &quot;Yeah, that's enough,
buddy. You head your little self over to that hospital to meet your
girlfriend!&quot;</p>
<p>Buckenberry felt a tinge of that inexplicable anger come back, but
he was able to hold back this time. He left the castle, again
stepping over the body of the guard who was still squirming with a
now bleeding nose. Buckenberry felt...nothing.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>Wendy was shoved into a dungeon cell, the exact one Bowser woke in
that morning. Wendy stumbled forward and Iggy and Z had left before
he regained her bearings. The atmosphere of the dungeon instantly got
to her. She'd never been thrown into a cell before and was shocked to
the core at how dark and dreary it felt.</p>
<p>&quot;HEEALLP!&quot; she screamed.</p>
<p>Doctor Professor Koopa approached his bars from across. &quot;You
too now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;W-who are- Wait, you?! They haven't moved you&hellip;&quot;
Wendy's words died on her tongue.</p>
<p>&quot;No. Not yet. What did you do? Come to your senses?&quot; he
asked dryly.</p>
<p>&quot;More like, I never lost mine. It's that Dark Boo. Everyone
he deals with becomes crazy. I never noticed until to day, but why
else would Iggy and poor grandpa turn on me?! Even daddy!&quot;</p>
<p>Doctor Professor sunk back down. &quot;Bowser is enchanted too?
All hope is lost then...&quot;</p>
<p>Wendy stomp her feet.&quot;No! We can't all be mad here. I know
Larry, Ludwig, and Junior aren't for example, because they were
called 'traitors'.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But what now, missy? If Bowser couldn't free himself on his
own, I doubt a young lady like you can.&quot;</p>
<p>Wendy was slightly offended by his sexism, but continued. &quot;It's
gonna be okay. Mario isn't even coming here, sugar. I've been
backstabbed by conniving friends online enough to know that when a
substitute shows up like that, there has to be something big planned.
For now, sit pretty. Or I will at least&hellip;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh boy&hellip;&quot; Doctor Professor groaned.</p>
<p>Back in the throne room, Bowser continued his research from his
phone.</p>

<p>Bowser let out a long sigh. Everything Kamek said so far was true;
nothing unusual, at least on paper, about 'Z' or 'Zoo' rather. Bowser
entertained the idea of speaking to his hiring agent but what good
would that do? Bowser had to admit that his hiring qualifications
weren't much more than having a dislike for Mario and a tolerance for
the lack of OSHA compliance. Being a criminal, illegal alien,
uneducated, psychotic, or a terrible dancer was perfectly fine
however.</p>
<p>His radio buzzed. &quot;Scouting Lakitu 23 reporting from Giant
Land. One soldier defeated and detained but heroes identified. May I
enter, my lord?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Copy,&quot; Bowser growled.</p>
<p>A moment later, a red faced Lakitu entered in on a cloud that was
obviously not his original.</p>
<p>Bowser hid his phone away. &quot;Why are you so late? You say
someone was defeated?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Y-yes, my lord! It was the green one and the yellow Toad,
but they had an unusual ally,&quot; Lakitu stammered.</p>
<p>Bowser leaned forward. &quot;Who?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was a boo I believe. Scared me to death from somewhere
invisible. I lost my radio too.&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser snorted. &quot;Luigi working with a boo? You fool, that was
probably a wandering boo that saw a good opportunity to pull a prank
on ya. That's what all Boos are like, so sneaky.&quot; Especially the
one I have working for me, Bowser thought. &quot;Scram, and get my
less cowardly scouts to inform me on further progress. Well, go on!&quot;</p>
<p>The Lakitu left, leaving Bowser to contemplate deeply until
someone else entered without knocking. It was Zoo.</p>
<p>&quot;My lord, Wendy is detained. Larry however has locked himself
in his room-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stop stop stop!&quot; Bowser interrupted. &quot;I didn't
authorize a witch hunt! The heroes are on their way, we can have
family drama later!&quot;</p>
<p>The smile disappeared from Z's face. &quot;I understand, but may I
ask a favor? May I go to Toad Town?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let me be honest, my lord.&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser raised on eyebrow.</p>
<p>Z continued, his eyes flashing. &quot;It's because of Mario's
little gang! They're separated all over, hehe, but the heart of the
situation is still in Toad Town. I've been spying on them a lot, and
they're up to no good and catching on quickly. Did you know Peach has
recalled our FungusUp idea? I just want to make sure they don't pull
anything. I mean, we're so close to success. You wouldn't want to
fail?&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser felt himself nodding, but he wasn't sure why.
&quot;Uh...sure&hellip;go...&quot; he mumbled.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, my lord. <em>You will not regret this</em>,
hehe!&quot;</p>
<p>Z left just as he came, leaving Bowser to wonder why did he
approve of that.</p>

<p>Luigi, Alagold and Boo emerged from the pipe. Like Richard had
told them, they were smack at the entrance of World 8, known as Dark
Land. The red sky, barren ground, and twisted, battle worn
architecture greeted them menacingly, along with the Lakitu above.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, how'd they get here so fast?!&quot; one called to the
other. &quot;They were just reported in Giant Land!&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi turned to Boo and Alagold. &quot;Looks like Richard might
have helped is in more ways than one. Maybe we'll be able to sneak to
his castle!&quot;</p>
<p>Boo nodded and grabbed his arm and then Alagold's. Luigi lead the
frantic invisible sprint that followed as they zipped past Rocky
Wrenches, Magikoopas, Boomerang bros, and other baddies that were
stationed to sit around waiting for an unfortunate hero. Luigi and
Alagold still had their powerups from before, making the path to
Bowser's Castle seem brighter than ever.</p>
<p>Alagold couldn't believe it. They really would be to Bowser's
Castle quickly. It was almost as if the coin he was clutching in his
other hand was working&hellip;</p>

<p>Buckenberry approached Mushroom Kingdom East Hospital to find it
completely taken over. It was closed as a public care facility and
new visitors were being redirected by guards to the next nearest
hospital, Mushroom Kingdom South Hospital, which was unfortunately
not very near at all.</p>
<p>Buckenberry didn't recognize the guards either. They were Toads
but they wore black outfits instead of Toad garments. Some even had
swat team equipment. They gave Buckenberry stares as he walked pass
them all and to the guard blocking the front entrance.</p>
<p>&quot;Authorization?&quot; he grunted.</p>
<p>Buckenberry blinked a few times. &quot;Huh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, you're here! Let him in!&quot; Toadette called from
inside.</p>
<p>The guard slowly stepped aside and Toadette gave Buckenberry a
bear hug while he remained stiff in her arms.</p>
<p>&quot;Glad, you're okay after all,&quot; she said breathlessly.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think I'm okay&hellip;&quot;</p>
<p>Toadette looked at him concernedly but led him inside. She picked
up her plate of fresh fruit from the cafeteria that she had setting
in a lobby chair. &quot;Well anyway, it's more of a wait and see game
now. Mario got in trouble on the roof, but otherwise you didn't miss
much. Want some?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No. Where is he?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>&quot;You missed him. He's all the way in the Special World by
now, probably,&quot; Yoshi said as Buckenberry passed him. He'd just
returned moments before.</p>
<p>Buckenberry slumped into a lobby chair without further inquiry.
Toadette and Yoshi shared a glance but dropped it.</p>
<p>Someone else stepped inside right then, a Dark Boo. He glanced
around lost looking, and when he saw the three, he covered his face
shyly.</p>
<p>&quot;You aren't authorized to be in here!&quot; Toadette yelled.</p>
<p>The front door guard peeped his head through the doors. &quot;Ma'am,
he is just the garbage collector.&quot;</p>
<p>Toadette's face softened. &quot;Oh, it's okay little guy. What's
your name?&quot;</p>
<p>The boo uncovered his face. &quot;Er, it's uh&hellip; Z- er Zoo,
hehe.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, yeah. This place is like, a complete mess. You aren't
allowed to go in Room 333 or 555. The King and our prisoner are in
those.&quot;</p>
<p>Zoo smiled widely. &quot;Wow. This is too easy really.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing. I'll get to the clean up, hehe&hellip;&quot; Zoo
floated down the hallway, but Buckenberry suddenly got up to follow.</p>
<p>&quot;Blue, what are you doing?&quot; Yoshi asked sharply. He
grabbed Buckenberry's shoulder.</p>
<p>&quot;DON'T TOUCH ME!&quot; he snapped as he pushed Yoshi to the
cold tiled floor.</p>
<p>&quot;Not this again,&quot; Yoshi muttered, quickly pulling
himself up. &quot;Can we not fight each other for one minute?! What's
with you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I DON'T KNOW!&quot; he responded.</p>
<p><strong>Crack!</strong></p>
<p>A plate was randomly broken on top of Yoshi's head from someone
behind. Yoshi fell to the floor again, leaving Buckenberry to gawk at
the perpetrator.</p>
<p>&quot;Toadette, what the crap?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know what came over me. I suddenly just had to hit
someone,&quot; she explained hypnotically.</p>
<p>Buckenberry backed up against a wall. &quot;We're all losing our
minds!&quot;</p>
<p>Toadette smiled at him while holding another ceramic plate.
Buckenberry ran for his life and Toadette chased him. Two guards that
were near the doors broke out into a fist fight over nothing.
Screaming and yelling from arguments was heard echoing through the
hallways, either from doctors or guards who suddenly found themselves
ticked off. The hospital had become a loud madhouse in a matter of
seconds.</p>
<p>Yoshi crawled into a lobby chair, his head in severe pain from the
blow. He dialed a number with his vision spinning. &quot;Hello...Noki
guy...come quick&hellip;&quot; The phone fell from his hands as Yoshi
found himself too dizzy to sit up. The last thing he saw was another
Toad girl approaching him.</p>
<p><strong>To be continued.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Author note: And now the big fight(s) begin. Enjoy!</strong></p>
