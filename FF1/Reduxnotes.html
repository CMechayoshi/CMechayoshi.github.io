<p>4.
Keep Your Friends Close 1/23/22, 1/24, 1/26/22 (renamed chapter),
1/27 (originally called In Which there is a mystery&quot; which was
lame. A lot of changes here. Title drop retained) Renamed in edits
Shiver.</font></font></font></p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2">
<p>5.
Ludwig's Scheme 1/28/22, 2/1- 2/3/22, 2/4, 2/5/22 (title drop
retained, lots of changes)</font></font></font></p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2">
<p>6.
Dying Inside 2/6/22ish, 2/8, 2/11/22 -2/14/22, 2/15/22 (changed from
'A soggy high heel', but title is title dropped AND the original
title is an in-story quote as well.)</font></font></font></p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2">
<p>7.
Transparent: (2/6/22, 2/19ish -2/22/22, 2/27/22, 3/2/22, 3/3/22, 3/4)
(changed from 'No courage, nerves, or pronouns'. Suffered some
development hell but title drop is present in Mario's dialogue. He
also mentions Chap 2. Bros before koopas, since I didn't incorporate
it in that chapter.)</font></font></font></p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2">
<p>8.
I've Lost My Head: Annoying real life stuff made this even rougher
than the above. (3/6/22, 3/12, 3/17, 3/20/22, 3/23, 3/28/22 - 4/1,
4/2, 4/4/22- 4/7.) Yes a month! So renamed but the original title of
'Bowser Wins' is reused in story. Title is a song reference.</font></font></font></p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2">
<p>9.
Love and War, part 1: We're back on schedule.. sorta. Here, we are no
longer tethered so much to the original structure, because that was
only hurting us. With that said, the dates for this chapter are the
same as the above, as those events in &quot;Bowser Win&quot; occur
here. NO title drop yet. That's reserved for part 2. ((4/8/22, 4/10,
4/15, 4/16, 4/19, 4/20, 4/22, 4/23 (slit in two parts)</font></font></font></p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2">
<p>10.
Love and War, part 2: Even more on schedule, completed in a few days
just like it should. I did have a pretty good template from the old
story, but I put in a few surprises too and made some key tweaks to
the plot and characters. The title drop is of course here. 'A
speciest and nationalist concept' which used to be chapter 9 is
credited here, since this is that chapter's remake. ((4/23 (split
from previous part), 4/24, 4/27, 4/28, 4/29))</font></font></font></p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2">
<p>11.
Statutes: Noooo, more schedule slips! Was originally called 'Typical
Saturday Morning' in the original so I kept a reference but otherwise
changed the title to reflect the theme of laws and how their hold on
some of the citizens. Old Redux tip toed around a lot of the themes
that are now in the forefront here, and yet we're just getting
started. ((4/30/22, 5/1/22, 5/2- 5/4- 5/8, 5/10, 5/11, 5/13, 5/14,
5/15-5/19, 5/20))</font></font></font></p>
<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><strong><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><p><span style="letter-spacing: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">Note:
As of this point, I stop crediting the dates of the original Redux
2019 chapters. There's too many changes and I chop up the sequences
and/or invent new ones too much. It would be little point. Other
supplementary material however will retain and bring out the
parallels</span></span></span></font></font></font></span></em></strong></p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2">
<p>12.
Pain, Unspecified: ((5/17/22, 5/22- 5/24, 5/25, 5/27, 6/1, 6/6, 6/7,
6/8-6/10, 6/11, 6/12, 6/13)) Neither the best nor worst time. We have
a new version of some events like the Bowser castle aftermath, Dr.
Toad arrival down south, plus totally unique events and
complications. Title is dropped and a reference to occupation.</font></font></font></p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2">
<p>13.
Deluge: ((6/14/22, 6/15 - 6/18, 6/23, 6/24, 6/25, 6/28, 7/1, 7/3
-7/7, 7/8 -7/10, 7/11(lol), 7/13, 7/14)) Dawg, there was so much
going on in that time span above, and fitting so much happening in
this chapter. Very apt title. Full of unique events tweaked from the
old Redux versions.</font></font></font></p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2">
<p>14.
Split: ((7/11 (tiny portion), 7/20 (true start), 7/22/22, 25, 26, 28,
30, 31)) This is the kind of development time I like. You love to see
it, more so when this is again mostly consisting of new events aside
from the Yoshi part.</font></font></font></p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2">
<p>15.
Separation Anxiety: ((Split from previous 7/26/22 (small portion,
some ideas), 8/2/22, 8/4, 8/5, 8/7, 8/8, 8/9, 8/11, 8/12)) More great
time and for such a slightly longer chapter and with content warnings
at that? (Which normally slows me down as I write it with different
care and or decided to use it at all. Officially here, we bump the
rating to T</font></font></font></p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2">
<p>16.
Brutality and Complexity: ((Portion split from last 8/9/22) 8/13,
8/14, 8/15, 8/16, 8/17- 20, 21, 8/22-26)) Oh boy, a powerful one. It
had to stand up to the original chapter titled this in the 2019
version. I think it did. I hope. Longer development time, though
still less than a month due to longer than normal word count.</font></font></font></p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2">
<p>17.
Ouroboros, part 1: ((8/17/22, 8/22/ parts removed added to previous,
8/27, 8/29, 9/1, 9/2-9/4, 9/5- 9/7, 9/8-9/10 (notes some dates refer
to sections moved to the next part), 9/11, 9)) Too many dates! That
because the other half as of the upload time was written and then
broken off to not overwhelm. There are many small details adding up
and fitting together. I didn't want them to be buried by outrageous
word counts.</font></font></font></p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2">
<p>18.
Ouroboros, part 2, 3 EDITED TO 2: ((Split/ dates: 9/10, 9/14, 9/15,
9/18 (other working dates are in the previous part) 9/19, 9/20- 9/23,
9/24)) What, two parts? Well there's only to be four so something had
to happen. For the words and scenarios the time here was really good
when we remember that this is a a busy and more complex chapter than
usual. Some of the earlier dates were parts shifted around. There
were moments were technical details of my interests were relevant to
insert, always a treat.</font></font></font></p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2">
<p>19.
Ouroboros 3: ((Split from previous: 9/18, 9/20, (new) 9/25, 9/27-
9/28, 10/1, 10/2- 10/5, 10/7, 10/8- 10/10, 10/13, 10/14, 10/15-
10/18)) A double upload with the below. Longish time not bad actually
for the word count and amount of progress plot wise, not to mention
that there were plenty of material left over for the next chapters.</font></font></font></p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2">
<p>20.
Love and War 3: ((Split from previous (note same as previous chapter
as this is a double release): 9/18, 9/20, (new) 9/25, 9/27- 9/28,
10/1, 10/2- 10/5, 10/7, 10/8- 10/10, 10/13, 10/14, 10/15- 10/18)) See
above.</font></font></font></p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2">
<p>21.
Bloom: ((Consider these the official work dates: 10/23/22, 10/26,
10/31, 11/1- 11/3, 11/4- 11/9, 11/15, 11/16- 11/20, 11/21)) Dumb
schedule slips errrggghhh! Real life caught up I suppose, and
speculation on where to go from here. Note: renamed Verisimilitude</font></font></font></p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2">
<p>22.
Opaque: ((Created: 11/17/22, 11/20, 11/22 (intentional hiatus, then-)
11/26-28, 11/30- 12/2, 12/3, 12/4- 12/8, 12/9- 12/11, 12/12- 12/15,
12/16)) Another Transparent where real life imagining and delays made
this take forever AGAIN...</font></font></font></p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2">
<p>23.
Revelation: ((Created: 12/4/22 (creation, I guess?), 12/12 (actual
work date likely), 12/15, 12/17, 12/26, 12/27, 12/29 - 1/1/23 - 1/7-
1/17, 1/18, 1/20, 1/21)) For once the month development time, into
the new year too, justifies itself with the word count. Also some of
the most 'adventurous' stuff I've ever written..</font></font></font></p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2">
<p>24.
Sloping Altars: ((1/22/23, 23, 26. 27, 28- 2/2, 2/4, 2/8, 2/10- 2/16,
2/21-26, 3/6- 3/9, Mar10/23)) Similar development time as we decided
how the wrap it up. More things that are real and raw.</font></font></font></p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2">
<p>25.
Ouroboros IV: ((3/9/23 3/11/23(real start) 3/12/23, 3/16/23, 3/18,
3/21, 3/24- 3/30- 4/5- 4/12- 4/27 - 5/9, 5/20 , 5/21- 5/29- 6/6-
6/14, 6/16- 6/19, (break) 7/13, 7/17- 7/21, 7/24 (note the pre June
dates are really drafts and ideals that don't exist anymore. Consider
the date beyond that the real ones for what you're actually reading))
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG wait, but the last is coming soon.</font></font></font></p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2">
<p>26.
Love and War IV: Ramifications: ((Dates with a grain of salt: (The
outline was done) 5/31/23, 6/10, (oh wow, i lost track 6/24) 7/2, 7/
4,- 7/9, (Hey, the real date is here) 7/25/23, 8/11/23- 8/14, 8/15,
