<p>Toad was a dangerous mushroom. Or rather a mushroom in danger, not
that he couldn't be dangerous though. Wait, hadn't this happened
before?</p>
<p>Toad looked at himself. He was dusty and dirty. Toad was no
stranger to adventures or even alternate dimensions but he'd never
woken up in the middle of nowhere before after a tennis match.</p>
<p>Up ahead he saw a booth of some sort. It was square shaped about
six feet tall and made of a weird greenish material. He walked
towards it.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello? Anyone inside? I'm missing my own tennis match and we
where winning!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Greetings exhumed traveler,&quot; the dark robed figure said
simply. Toad ignored the insult.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm Toad and you gotta help me. I know I might have gotten
zapped by one too many thunderclouds but I've never blanked out
before.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Blanked out? This is the <strong>Whoa Zone</strong>. And
it's as real as ever. Oh, and nice racket!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But but-&quot; now Toad was starting to panic. He felt
something in his pocket. It was his tennis racket! The custom one he
owned with his insignia on it!</p>
<p>&quot;How did-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hey maybe I can help for a fee,&quot; the guide interrupted.
&quot;I am the only guide around here in the known universe.&quot;</p>
<p>Toad check his other pockets, they were empty except for a
familiar hair accessory. A hair accessory that Toad remembered coming
from Daisy. She wanted him to hang on to it until after the match.
This was real...or was it?</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>Mario and his friends were at the 'Koopa and Kailey Circus'. They
observed the various freaks being displayed in cages such as a Chain
Chomp mixed with a Ptooie.</p>
<p>&quot;It's nice to see these weirdos in cages for once,&quot;
Mario said, although he had never seen anything as freaky as that. He
shrugged and took a bite out of his corn dog. &quot;It's about time
we got a day off for fun.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm hungry,&quot; Luigi complained.</p>
<p>&quot;Luigi, you complain about everything. That's why you aren't
my real brother!&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi cried as Toad and the Mushroom King laughed. Daisy looked on
in horror.</p>
<p>&quot;Mario! How could you say- Wait, where am I?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The circus, your highness!&quot; Toad said, burying his face
in a cup of popcorn half the size of him.</p>
<p>&quot;Toad, I'm not your princess. You can call me Daisy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Princess stop being modest,&quot; Mario said with a hint of
sarcasm. &quot;We get it. You are the princess of the Mushroom
Kingdom ever since you kicked Peach out of office.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Y-yeah and-&quot; Luigi sniffled, &quot;Now all Nintendo
gamers finally give you the respect you deserve.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes dear, and you appear in way more games now. And they
aren't spin-offs either. Isn't that great?&quot; The King added.</p>
<p>&quot;Umm excuse me guys. I appreciate all this but, I don't know
what y'all are talking about. I'm missing my own tennis match, and I
was winning!&quot; Daisy shifted uncomfortably. Something was very
wrong here. She was still dressed casually as usual but away from the
game and her hair accessory was missing. Of course she didn't feel
all that great during the match but she was enjoying it, and winning
it!</p>
<p>Mario and the rest just looked at her and laughed, even Luigi who
was seemingly over Mario's insult and Toad whose head was still in
the bag of popcorn.</p>
<p>&quot;Good one my daughter!&quot; The King said.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, you aren't even my dad. You're Peach's!&quot;</p>
<p>Everyone laughed again.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey!&quot; Toad yelled as he lifted his head from the
popcorn, &quot;Let's have a picture taken in that tent over there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But guys-!&quot; Daisy protested. This was it, she was going
to get some answers.</p>
<p>As everyone made their way toward the tent, Daisy suddenly tackled
Mario, pinning him to the ground.</p>
<p>&quot;Omg!&quot; Toad shouted.</p>
<p>&quot;TELL ME WHATS GOING ON OR 'HI I'M DAISY' WILL TURN INTO
'HI-YA DAISY'!&quot; she screamed from on top of him.</p>
<p>&quot;OKAY! And please don't hurt me with that tennis racket!&quot;
Mario shouted back in panic.</p>
<p>&quot;Well you'd better- wait what racket?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;R-right there?&quot; Luigi said pointing towards the orange
racket with Daisy's insignia strapped to her purse.</p>
<p>Daisy got up from Mario and grabbed the racket. Everyone covered
their faces defensively.</p>
<p>&quot;No, I'm not about to hit any of y'all but don't you see?
This proves I don't belong here. I was in a tennis match against
Mario and Bowser-&quot;</p>
<p>Mario gasped.</p>
<p>&quot;And Toad was my partner-&quot;</p>
<p>Toad gasped.</p>
<p>&quot;Like I'd ever partner with Bowser. What do you think we are
friends? Frenemies?&quot; Mario laughed at his 'joke'. &quot;How
dumb, besides you yourself defeated Bowser with your karate a while
back.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And as if you'd partner with me?&quot; Toad said, &quot; You
hate me!&quot;</p>
<p>Daisy stomped her feet. She wasn't getting anywhere with these
people who called themselves her friends and family.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>Bowser got up from his throne and head toward his kitchen, while
trying to discreetly put his phone away. Kamek, who was observing
followed.</p>
<p>&quot;Meeting 'him' again, your evilness?&quot; Kamek said snidely
but respectfully.</p>
<p>Bowser started. &quot;Excuse me?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You know, Mario?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No!&quot; Bowser replied, crossing his arms.</p>
<p>&quot;No offense, your evilness. But we need you here in the
Castle and not playing games with Mario and friends. Did you know
your son Ludwig was just pranked by TMKMZ?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hmm? Didn't they put that quicksand in my bodywash?
Whatever, I'm over that and this doesn't involve games this time.&quot;
They entered the kitchen. It was quiet at this hour with only the
head cook in and the Koopalings and other castle citizens having
already ate dinner.</p>
<p>&quot;Then what could it be?!&quot; Kamek asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing! Now cover for me for tonight. That's an order!&quot;
Bowser commanded while grabbing snacks from the fridge.</p>
<p>&quot;And who is that for, Mario and pals?&quot; Kamek said
snidely and now without respect.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey! You are my lead Castle Advisor, not my nutritionist.
Hey- back off!&quot;</p>
<p>Kamek snatched something Bowser was reaching for. Pasta!</p>
<p>&quot;T-this proves it!&quot; Kamek screamed.</p>
<p>&quot;Shut-up and give me that!&quot; Bowser snatched it back. &quot;I
have somewhere to be an I'll need an air ship to do it. Do as I've
told you,&quot; Bowser grabbed the snacks and hurried away to his
private quarters.</p>
<p>Kamek narrowed his eyes&hellip;</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>&quot;Okay Toad and Daisy are here-&quot; the nurse said opening
the door.</p>
<p>&quot;Umm, nurse Nass T. I wasn't done,&quot; the mustached Koopa
Doctor plead. He was in the middle of a check up on them both.</p>
<p>&quot;Too bad- here they are,&quot; Nass T. said walking away
quickly. Mario and co. walked in and simultaneously gasped.</p>
<p>&quot;Er uh. They're unconscious as you can see, but the brain
scans show lots of brain activity on both. This is umm good I think,&quot;
the doctor tried to quickly explain.</p>
<p>They rushed past him to the beds. Toad was in the bed near the
window, looking peacefully asleep but also confused. Daisy was nearer
to the door and seemed slightly peeved in her sleep.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh no...&quot; Mario muttered, &quot;I had no idea...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But doc, do they have a fever, a rash, an anything?&quot;
Luigi asked in hysterics.</p>
<p>&quot;N-no? But lots of patients today are showing similar
symptoms. I can't say much else.</p>
<p>&quot;That explains the mad house in the lobby,&quot; Luigi
thought.</p>
<p>&quot;But why not?&quot; Mario demanded.</p>
<p>&quot;By the way, I'm Doctor Professor Koopa.&quot; The doctor
said, dodging Mario's question.</p>
<p>&quot;Doctor Professor?&quot; Yoshi asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. You can be both you know, and I promise to do all I can
for your friends but um. The nurse sent you too in here a bit too
soon, could you guys come back in half an hour? We have more brain
scans to do,&quot; he explained timidly.</p>
<p>Mario and co. took the hint and left silently after one last
glance.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I promise. I will get to the bottom of this,&quot;
Mario said quietly to himself.</p>
<p>They stood outside the door silently for a moment.</p>
<p>&quot;This seems fishy, hehe,&quot; Boo said, still invisible.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course it is,&quot; Mario started, &quot;I knew that from
the start but-&quot; His phone buzzed. &quot;Hold on, uh, I'll meet
you guys in the cafeteria!&quot; Mario said backing away.</p>
<p>&quot;Bro. Where are you going?&quot; Luigi asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, bathroom. I'll only be gone a sec, see you there!&quot;
Mario quickly rounded the corner and checked the message.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Okay, plumber. I'm on my way. Yes, I have snacks.
*mischievous emoji*&quot;</em></p>
<p>Mario smiled a bit. With Bowser's &quot;forceful&quot; nature.
Maybe they could get some real answers, and his friends would just
have to deal with it. Or, he hoped he could convince them to.</p>

because this very day of writing this, my ipad was stolen! Don't
worry, I'll try to work on this story and more when ever I can.</strong></p>
<p style="page-break-before: always"><strong>Mario and Bowser:
Frenemies Forever</strong></p>
<p><strong>Conversational interlude (Chapter 7)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Created: 2/25/17</strong></p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer: Mario and co. belong to Nintendo.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Author note: I hope this isn't coming off as a rip-off of
another certain fanfic involving Mario and Bowser. To be honest, yes
that did inspire the premise of this story, but I'm taking the idea
in a different direction of course. So that's just a heads up if
anyone was noticing parallels, trust me most were unintentional! :p</strong></p>
<p><strong>This chapter may be less &quot;actiony&quot; compared to
other chapters but more conversational (thus the title) characters
will ramble a bit but hopefully not too much. Enjoy.</strong></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>&quot;-And so the doctor was suspicious and stuff but it's going
to be okay because we have Mario on the case!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yoshi, we can hear everything you are saying,&quot; Luigi
griped.</p>
<p>Luigi, Yoshi, and Boo were in the hospital cafe. Birdo was too, in
spirit at least since Yoshi had filled her in on so many details
though their phone call that she might as well have been present.
They had been waiting twenty minutes at least and no Mario in sight.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, sorry Luigi. It isn't my fault Mario is taking
forever!&quot; Yoshi griped back.</p>
<p>&quot;It'll be alright,&quot; Boo said thumbing through a free
'Zess T. approved' cooking magazine. Another magazine, a weathered
'Kart and Driver' from three months ago was resting on Boo's head
like a hat of sorts, serving as a disguise. No one had screamed yet,
so it seemed to be working.</p>
<p>&quot;Easy for you to say,&quot; Luigi muttered.</p>
<p>&quot;What's gotten in to you? You haven't been the same
since...before the tennis match,&quot; said Yoshi.</p>
<p>&quot;Well it's just that-&quot; Luigi leaned back as he
contemplated, &quot;Life has been strange lately...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Compared to what, dear?&quot; Birdo asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, just the way things HAD been and the way they are now-
wait, Birdo?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh sorry I must have put the speaker phone on!&quot; Yoshi
apologized.</p>
<p>&quot;No darling, leave me on. Listen Luigi, life is a little
strange, and we are all a little strange but that's what makes life
wonderful. Right now from what I understand, our friends are in
danger and we'll only get through this together.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Haha, right on,&quot; Yoshi agreed. Luigi sat up.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess you're right-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Luigi. Live, laugh, love. Inspirational posters stole
that line from me. Alright now, Yoshi I gotta go. Keep me in touch,
okay? Bye now!&quot; Right when Birdo hung up Yoshi got up from his
seat with a panicked look.</p>
<p>&quot;My battery is at six percent- Is there an outlet anywhere?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, in the lobby,&quot; Boo said, now looking at the
driving magazine. As it turned out, a new thing was coming out called
the Koopa Petty's Karting Experience meant to rival Mario Kart.</p>
<p>&quot;Great. I'll be right back, text me if you hear from Mario,&quot;
Yoshi said leaving before Luigi could remind him that he had no
phone. He slouched back in his seat again.</p>
<p>&quot;Depressed again?&quot; Boo asked. &quot;Birdo is a real
quote maker, right?&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi shrugged. &quot;Oh, sure but that was nothing new. I'm no
stranger to strangeness.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Same. Besides I like 'funny' more than 'weird'. My personal
quote is 'Laugh or else!'&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Or...else what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who knows? Something something boos are scary and all that.
I don't know. It was passed down from my great great great
grandfather's dentist's lawyer's milkman. Who heard it originally
from his neighbor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And was the neighbor?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hehe. A clown.&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi at first shuddered but then smiled slightly at the
absurdity.</p>
<p>&quot;Having conflicting emotions?&quot; Boo teased.</p>
<p>Luigi attempted a straight face, &quot;Its nothing I just uh- so
anyway could you text Mario again for me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure, but are you worried?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You've only had me text him twenty times since we've been in
the cafe.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, yes I am worried about my friends,&quot; Luigi said
defensively.</p>
<p>&quot;No no. I mean about Mario? Listen, you can tell me. I've
been keeping secrets for thousands of years.&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi paused for a moment. &quot;Really? Well uh, it's just
that..&quot; he leaned in to whisper, &quot;Ever since the night
before the tennis match, there was this voicemail from Bowser!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And then?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it seemed like they were friends. I was in disbelief
but then I found out they were tennis partners. And then this weird
thing with Daisy and Toad happened. Mario is hiding something and it
kind of hurts that he'd do this..&quot; Luigi sat back and sighed.
Boo took on a serious expression and said-</p>
<p>&quot;Luigi I-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT: Mushroom Kingdom East, the Princess
Peach Toadstool has entered the building! Let's give her a round of
applause!&quot; The intercom blasted with forced enthusiasm. The cafe
was nearly empty during the evening so unfortunately the Princess did
not get her applause.</p>
<p>Boo and Luigi stared for a moment.</p>
<p>&quot;Er uh, so Boo. Do you believe me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Luigi.&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi sighed in relief. &quot;Great, because I don't think anyone
would believe me. Especially not Yoshi. He's sooo loyal to Mario. Too
loyal. So it's good I guess that I'm not crazy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course not, but I am if that counts for anything,&quot;
Boo said jokingly. Luigi grinned.</p>
<p>&quot;Listen, we can solve what's going on with my brother and
confront Bowser. I just know he has to be behind this somehow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Possibly but let's get the facts first. Like that show,
'Cheaters: Game Genie edition'.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, I pray to Eldstar NOT! How could Bowser not be behind
it? How many more villains do we have?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You'd never know. Bowser's an easy scapegoat. The most
popular unpopular guy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;True but at the tennis game, didn't you gave me the idea
that Bowser was behind it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No I said there was a plot to ruin the game, hehe. No one
mentioned Bowser.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But your 'trusted sources'?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My agency. My secret one that I can't reveal to a non-boo.
Sorry the rules are speciesist like that. But yeah, I know something
dirty is going on but I don't know where exactly that dirt is coming
from, so is a mystery for now. Oooh, this is sooo much fun!
Well...aside from people's lives being in danger.&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi rolled his eyes. He should have been annoyed by now but he
wasn't.</p>
<p>&quot;Boo? You know, I really was wrong about you. You've only
been my best ally from the start during this mess. I'm sorry for
being grouchy before.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks, but how could I not try to help? I have a confession
too. I don't actually have thousands of years worth of secrets!&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi's eyes widened. &quot;Don't tell me. You're even older?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Heck no. I'm twenty five like you, hehe. You calling me old?
It's okay, until today I though you were just as awesome as Mario.
Now I realize you're twice as much. I mean, you're more sensitive and
more honest. More down to Earth- Yeah, Mario might be more popular
but I'm agoraphobic anyway. Besides I uh hehe, I've always been a fan
of yours... When I saw you at the tennis match, I was like, 'wow I'm
getting to work with Luigi!' Sweet!&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi found himself blushing again. A real fan? Before anything
else could be said, Boo's phone buzzed as it finally got a reply from
Mario.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Hello Bro and Boo. Sorry about the delay my phone was on
silent. Meet me back in the lobby. *apologetic emoji*&quot;</em></p>
<p>&quot;Hmm,&quot; Luigi narrowed his eyes. &quot;I guess you are
right, pal. Let's play nice for now, especially since Peach has
entered the building. After all, it's not like Mario would bring
Bowser right to our faces!&quot;</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>Mario felt... guilty. This was certainly different, he'd never
been the secretive type and he didn't like the feeling of lying
either. Even if it was for the 'greater good' like he tried to
convince himself. That was it, he'd come clean right when Bowser
showed up, well to Luigi at least. Yoshi and even the Princess were
close friends but also very &quot;by the book&quot;. They'd be the
last ones he could convince about Bowser not being a completely bad
person. Besides Luigi was the only family Mario had nearby and &quot;Bros
before Koopas&quot; as they'd always say.</p>
<p>As he stood on the roof, at the airship drop off zone, he then
heard the roaring of an airship. A Koopa airship. He looked up, sure
enough one was fast approaching. Airships were authorized to hover
over the dedicated zone over the hospital for emergency patients, but
he wondered what staff may think if they realized it was a Bowser
ship. As if on cue-</p>
<p>&quot;Wow, didn't think I'd see one of those!&quot; the Ems
worker, Emery T. said. &quot;I thought Bowser had his own hospital
for his lackeys. I wonder why he's sending someone here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Eh, actually Bowser is coming himself,&quot; Mario said. He
figured might as well be honest at this point.</p>
<p>&quot;B-Bowser? Good thing we have you here, Mario. The Princess
has just entered downstairs!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What? Peach is here? Oh no!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's okay Mario. You can like, protect us right? But how do
you know it's Bowser?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because...I told him to come?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh?-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Listen, don't sound any alarms. It's going to be okay. He's
not attacking, or doing anything illegal this time... I hope... I
need Bowser to help me get to the bottom of the mysterious illness
going around.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The 'T-Virus'?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh? We know what it is now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh no, that's just what my supervisor told us refer to it
as. Don't worry, the &quot;T&quot; just stands for &quot;tennis&quot;,
since the cases only starting popping up after that tennis match
earlier. Hey weren't you in it?&quot; Mario nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, thought so. I was sneaking and watching it on my break
earlier. I have like, no supervision as the only ems waiting on the
roof all day. Anyway, how could Bowser help?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, he has a way with words, and everything is so 'hush
hush' here, that would help. Besides I kind of threw him under the
bus earlier and I wanted to make it up, especially since some people
are thinking he's behind it all.&quot;</p>
<p>Emery shrugged. &quot;Don't tell anyone, but I don't really
dislike Bowser. I know he's technically bad and stuff but he's so
cool as well. I had a Bowser fan club back in college before..
well... you don't wanna know. Anyway. I'm not sure about him ruling
the Kingdom but, I've always wanted to visit his castle at least. If
you think he's innocent, then I do to!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ready? I didn't think anyone would believe me. I just want
things to be alright with us, you know?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yeah. I get it,&quot; she smirked. &quot;I guess even
Bowser deserves a second chance. Yep, that's totally what's going on
here. Yes sir, your secret is safe with me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Phew! Thanks, wait what do you mean by-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;- LANDING!&quot; She announced loudly. &quot;-Sorry its the
procedure.&quot;</p>
<p>The airship was now hovering above the hospital, its shadow
covering only part of the building. This was a smaller personal
Airship, made for speed and general transportation rather than battle
and thankfully it had no visible cannons or other weapons.</p>
<p>In a well rehearsed fashion Emery did a landing sign meaning
'standby'. She entered the airship's Id number in the database and
then signed again, this time signaling patient transference. Mario
stood by nervously as a shadowed figure suddenly took a thirty foot
drop from starboard and landed right on the painted target.</p>
<p><strong>Thud</strong>!</p>
<p>&quot;The King has arrived!&quot; Bowser announced. He stood
straight up and flipped the hood off of he head as his black robe
blew in the wind. Right then the airship took off in the opposite
direction it came. Mario was momentarily speechless.</p>
<p>&quot;Wow, I've never been this close before. I didn't know you
were so tall!&quot; Emery fangirled. (I'm making that a word.)</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, yeah. Who are you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Emery T.! Shhh, don't tell anyone, but can I have your
autograph?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ha! Well of course you can have your future King's, uh...
got a pen?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bowser!&quot; Mario started. &quot;I saw Toad and Daisy and
they were in a coma like state- no one knows what's going on and the
doctors aren't giving out any information- and the Princess is here-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hold it now, what's this about a Princess?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bowser! It's Peach!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh man!&quot; Emery said.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh man? More like oh yes! Mario, why didn't you tell me this
would be fun?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fun? I don't think so,&quot; Mario sighed. &quot;And do you
always exit airships like that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Only for you, Mario.&quot; Mario blinked twice and Emery
suppressed a laugh. Bowser ignored their responses. &quot;Now take me
to your Princess.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, I'm taking you to...wait, where was I gonna take you? Oh
yeah, uh.. I'm texting Luigi. We need to talk to him first.&quot;
Mario checked his silenced phone. There were a LOT of messages from
Boo's number. Mario suddenly felt a bit sick.</p>
<p>&quot;Fine, whatever plumber. Then to the Princess, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What about my autograph?&quot; Emery whined.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll give you one when I take over the Kingdom. Deal?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes!&quot; She fist pumped. &quot;Wait, should I be cheering
about that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bowser come on!&quot; Mario grabbed Bowser's arm and lead
him back inside. &quot;Oh and keep that hood on please.&quot; Mario
added silently. Bowser laughed.</p>
<p><strong>To be continued.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Author note: Okay, hope this turned out well. Next
chapter, I'm going to try to bring back more action and comedy. Stay

<p><strong>Life lessons/ fun facts:</strong></p>
<p><strong>-When you see motivation posters in doctor offices, thank
Birdo.</strong></p>
<p><strong>-Bowser did gymnastics in high school. Don't tell him I
said that.</strong></p>
<p><strong>-College is not the place to start Bowser fan clubs.
Especially if said collage is funded by Peach.</strong></p>
<p><strong>-The Koopa Petty Karting Experience is still open for
participants. It's safer than Mario Kart they say.</strong></p>

Frenemies Forever</strong></p>
<p><strong>Confrontational interlude (Chapter 8)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Created: 3/1/17- 3/7/17</strong></p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer: If only I owned Mario and co.! (So basically I
don't guys...)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Author note: Okay there is a little more talky stuff here,
but don't worry. Action is coming next chapter! This chapter went
through a few rewrites as you can see by the creation dates and for
some reason this has been the hardest to write. One issue was is that
didn't want to make characters too OOC (because this is NOT a AU
story) but at the same time I needed to make things work. In the end
I settled for something way less melodramatic than I initially had.
Enjoy.</strong></p>

<p>Mario tugged on Bowser as they made it down the stairs. Mario was
lost in thought, trudging along half beaten through a lava and spike
filled fortresses actually seemed easier than admitting you've messed
up this badly to your closest friends.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, mustache, knock it of!&quot; Bowser shifted out of his
grasp. &quot;Listen I like ya, but- wow you don't look so good. Are
you sick now too?!&quot;</p>
<p>Mario stopped and looked towards him worriedly. &quot;Listen
Bowser, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I need to know I can
trust you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Trust me? Now, what do you mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm serious. I know I've thrown you under the bus a lot but
I promise I won't anymore. We're going to head downstairs and tell
Luigi everything but I need be sure that you won't...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That I won't what?!&quot;</p>
<p>Mario hesitated. &quot;Well, can you uh...'play nice'? Make it
easier for them to see that you aren't all bad?-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I am certainly bad-&quot; Bowser crossed his arms
defiantly.</p>
<p>&quot;Well I don't mean 'bad' meaning 'good'. I mean make them
realize that you're a frenemy and not a fiend. Make any sense?&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser contemplated.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay so you're gonna tell Luigi or whatever that we talk on
the phone sometimes, that you intentionally invite me to your
parties, and that we even eat cake sometimes? By the way, I brought
you this-&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser handed over the sealed but fresh pasta to Mario, whose
stomach growled as if on cue.</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks I uh, hadn't-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't mention it plumber,&quot; Bowser smiled. &quot;Alright
now look here, I'll play nice or whatever because believe it or not,
you ain't the only one whose had to hide things from friends and
family. Only Kamek knows I left the castle tonight and he's kind of
on to us, but that's a problem for another day. It's alright though,
he's never been invited to any Mario Parties anyway.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mario Party 8 and 9&quot; Mario mumbled, eating the pasta
straight from the container. The savage!</p>
<p>&quot;Darn it. Oh well, let's see that brother of yours already
and would you not smack so loudly?&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi and Boo were back in the lobby. At this hour it had calmed
down considerably. In fact, no one was around aside from one other
person sitting in the lobby.</p>
<p>&quot;Now it's a ghost town... no offense Boo.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hehe. It's fine. But where is Princess Peach?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Someone mentioned me?&quot; a high pitched and feminine
voice called. They brought their attention to someone sitting alone,
wearing a pink colored cloak.</p>
<p>&quot;This is terrible and its all my fault.&quot; The person
removed their hood to reveal the daintily featured Princess Peach.
Her hair was pulled back, she wore no make up, and her eyes were
slightly reddened from crying. The cloak covered over her usual
dress. She put away some tissues as she got up.</p>
<p>&quot;Princess! I had no idea!&quot; Luigi got up to hug her.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh Luigi! I should have never hosted that tennis tournament.
Everyone might be okay otherwise!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's not your fault, your highness. We don't know what the
heck is going on ourselves,&quot; Luigi said. Peach regained her
composure slightly.</p>
<p>&quot;Doctor Professor Koopa hasn't spoken to you? He says it's
exhaustion, but the severest kind!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What? We haven't heard a thing, that Doctor Professor or
whatever kicked us out earlier.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh huh. Total creep. And I know creepy!&quot; Boo boasted.</p>
<p>&quot;Boo?! Oh I didn't notice you- why do you have a magazine on
your head? I mean... where are my manners? Forget that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So, you got actual explanations from the Doc?&quot; Luigi
asked quickly to avoid farther awkwardness.</p>
<p>&quot;Technically a nurse relayed the info from him to me and
promptly disappeared. I didn't see him personally but if he's the
Doctor Professor Koopa I know, he isn't a sham.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You know him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Kind of. When I was a little girl, he worked for my father
as a castle physician, so he has to have some merits. Anyway, I came
here incognito, but then the receptionist just had to announce my
name like that,&quot; Peach pouted. &quot;Fortunately hardly anyone
was here then. So strange, I thought more people was being affected,
or at least that the word I got at the Castle earlier. So who's with
you? I thought I saw Yoshi a while ago talking loudly on the phone,
but he didn't notice me here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, that's Yoshi alright. Mario is here too, but where? I
don't know...&quot; Luigi said slightly disgruntled.</p>
<p>Peach raised one eyebrow as foot steps of two people were easily
heard around the corner down the hall. Suddenly there was the sound
of someone running ahead.</p>
<p>&quot;Guys! I'm sorry I took so long!&quot; Mario said whipping
around the corner. &quot;And Princess, what a surprise-er oof!&quot;</p>
<p>Peach immediately latched on to Mario with a firm but princess
like hug. Mario stood with a dear in headlights look as Luigi and Boo
side eyed them.</p>
<p>&quot;Mario! Oh thank the stars. What to do?&quot;</p>
<p>Mario stood frozen in her grasp as someone else appeared from
around the corner. Peach pulled back and gasped.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, Princess,&quot; Bowser greeted with an toothily grin.</p>
<p>&quot;B-Bowser?!&quot; Peach and Luigi shrieked. Boo took this
opportunity to speak up.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah-hem. Luigi was wanting an intervention with you Mario,
because he feels he is being lied to and this makes him feel bad as
well,&quot; Boo explained matter of factly. &quot;Oh and DON'T YOU
UPSET MY LUIGI!&quot; Everyone stopped and stared at this outburst.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait, I do have something to say,&quot; Mario said breaking
the ice.</p>
<p>&quot;Bro, why is Bowser here?&quot; Luigi asked in a hushed
fashion.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes Mario, this is my kidnapper!&quot; Peach said likewise.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, yes I know. We don't have to whisper. It all started
back during the very first Super Mario Kart, you guys all remember
how weird it was at first to be playing along with each other in a
friendly way, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes I guess so...&quot; Luigi said.</p>
<p>&quot;And so, after the one of the circuits, me and Bowser talked.
He was just insulting me and bragging about his castle but that's
besides the point. I said something about it looking dangerous and
unlivable. He told me that that was just what was visible in the
games, the normal parts were really nice. I hadn't really bothered
with Bowser aside from the games so one day finally I came over to
see how things were and it was completely different than I thought.
Then it hit me: I didn't really know Bowser all! Later we had the
Mario Party's and so I invited Bowser and then the sports games and
etc. Yeah, Bowser was a villain in those too, but behind the scenes,
we casually talked more. He was kind of cool aside from the princess
kidnapping and villain stuff. So it didn't happen over night, but
it's been decades and over time we're like that friend that you
dislike except not really because you keep hanging out anyway.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;-Because you call me first,&quot; Bowser quipped. No one
else was amused.</p>
<p>&quot;But Mario, why didn't you tell us about this!?&quot; Peach
demanded. Luigi remained silent.</p>
<p>&quot;Well...I was a coward. Yes, even me 'Mario' is scared of
some things. Turns out my weakness isn't lava, baddies or even poison
mushrooms but...what people think of me. Me hating Bowser was like
the law, and so many people looked up to me. I just felt that if I
told anyone otherwise I'd be letting them down. I've always had a
hard time expressing things so I just kept silent about it. I
shouldn't have hidden this for so long. I'm sorry, and I hope that
you guys can forgive me but Bowser isn't a truly bad guy, and we
won't get though this if we don't work together. You have every right
to be upset, but I ask at least that we can work with Bowser for now
to get to the bottom of things.&quot; Mario waited for a reaction as
Bowser stood behind slightly impatient.</p>
<p>&quot; So...&quot; Luigi finally said, &quot;friends?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Frenemies,&quot; Boo clarified.</p>
<p>&quot;Since way back?&quot; Peach asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Since forever, more like,&quot; Bowser said grinning again.
(ZOMG title drop!) &quot;So are we all together now or what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Umm-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And the living quarters of my castle are great. You should
really check it out sometime, Princess.&quot; Bowser winked, Peach
shuddered.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, thank you Bowser but I'd rather not. Mario, I forgive
you but-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What about me?&quot; Luigi interrupted. &quot;You could have
told me!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Luigi, I'm sorry,&quot; Mario plead. Luigi stared towards
the floor and didn't answer.</p>
<p>&quot;Can Bowser really help though?&quot; Peach thought out loud,
oblivious to Luigi.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course I can, babe. Who would go up against this?&quot;
Bowser flexed a bicep. Mario ignored (or tired to ignore) this and
approached Luigi under the scrutiny of Boo.</p>
<p>&quot;Luigi, I'll never do it again. I promise! Please don't hate
me brother!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay,&quot; Luigi said flatly before Mario suddenly hugged
him, catching him off guard.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah I sped down the hall and almost got trampled a few
times by people rushing out of the hospital for some reason, but I
had to get to that outlet, because that is just what our love means
me!&quot; Yoshi conversed loudly as he rounded the corner.</p>
<p>Everyone froze.</p>
<p>&quot;Birdo...I'm gonna have to hang up,&quot; Yoshi said as he
slowly put the phone down. He looked quizzicality at the gang.</p>
<p>Bowser turned towards him. &quot;Hey Dinosaur breath. Look, I'm
not here for trouble, but there's a lot of explaining to do. You
might wanna sit down.&quot;</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>Doctor Professor Koopa sat down in his cramped, dimly lit office
for the first time in hours. Everything hurt, especially his feet.
His ears from the constant screaming of the higher ups. Speaking of
which-</p>
<p><em>Ring! Ring! Ring!</em></p>
<p>Doctor Professor jumped. Once glance at the caller Id sent shivers
to his spine. He hesitantly hit 'accept'.</p>
<p>&quot;You IDIOT! Exhaustion?! Even the Super Mario Party fools
will see through that!&quot; they screamed.</p>
<p>&quot;B-but t-the Princess! She seemed to understand-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Listen here you backwards quack. She. Is. Blonde. You think
that means something? What's next, you gonna brag about how you stole
candy from a baby? Ooh! Look at me! I am a Doctor and a Professor and
a Koopa and I used to work in Princess Peach's castle! I must think
I'm important!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;P-please don't mock me, master!&quot; The Doctor spoke up.</p>
<p>&quot;My goodness! At least you managed to evacuate the hospital
like I asked you,</p>
<p>so you aren't completely useless. Now, tell them something
better.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;L-like what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are the doctor here or the professor, what ever you are!
Make it good-&quot; the other end hung up. Doctor Professor waited
for his heart to stop pounding. He got up and left his office limping
slightly.</p>

<p><strong>Life lessons/ fun facts (but mostly facts)</strong></p>
<p><strong>-Mario and friends are canonically actors in their own
games.</strong></p>
<p><strong>-Bowser's castle is a fun place...if you like lava!</strong></p>
<p><strong>-Regarding Boo: As a generic enemy their Japanese name is
the feminine &quot;Teresa&quot; so my reasoning is this, depending on
localization boo is male or female and that's my basis of ambiguously
gendered Boo in this story. (Yes Boos that are specific characters
have genders like King Boo and female Boos in Paper Mario, but again
I mean generic ones.)</strong></p>

<p>Toad was a dangerous mushroom. The most dangerous one ever known.
More deadly than a &quot;Death Cap&quot;. More sticky than the web of
a &quot;Webcap&quot;. More cold and dreary than the autumn of an
&quot;Autumn Skullcap&quot;. Well, in theory.</p>
<p>So anyway he was dangerous. When one thinks of a bad mushroom
trip, it comes from Toad. And Toad was still walking for
miles...miles in the <strong>Whoazone</strong>!</p>
<p>&quot;Sure, I'm flattered, opening narration. Apparently I'm not
only dangerous, I'm more 'bad' than Mario Jackson. But I'm still lost
and nothing has been accomplished aside from finding this tennis
racket. This sucks!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hey you!&quot; a feminine voice called.</p>
<p>Toad looked to the right. Where was a purple colored booth ahead
with a dark figure inside, though Toad could have sworn nothing was
there a second ago.</p>
<p>&quot;Head on over here handsome, if you just don't know what to
do!&quot;</p>
<p>Toad raised one eyebrow but approached anyway.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, I'm Toad and-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are lost. Just admit it! Men never want to use a map, I
tell you. It's always, 'Oh I'll find away out of this alternate
dimension on my own!' and then of course-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;-Excuse me?&quot; Toad cut in. &quot;I would love a map,
ma'am!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What? I'm shocked. You can't see it right now but I am!&quot;</p>
<p>This was true. This guide was dressed exactly like the one before,
a dark robe with her face an all else completely hidden.</p>
<p>She began again, &quot;You are going to be my first customer since
forever.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah about that, I'm broke. Could I borrow a map or
something?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh sure, just sign here!&quot; A paper suddenly appeared on
the booth's desk. &quot;But I'll need to take collateral, sugar.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Umm,&quot; Toad mumbled while speed reading the agreement, a
skill any trusted Castle Advisor should master. &quot;I have a racket
with my emblem on it and a hair accessory, but the hair thing belongs
to an important friend so you'd better not take-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So hair accessory it is!&quot; the guide said.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, wait where did it go?&quot; The yellow hair band was
gone from his pocket.</p>
<p>&quot;Dude! I mean- ma'am! I can't give you that!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh really? Because you already signed the contract.&quot;</p>
<p>Toad looked down and gasped. &quot;Toad Toad&quot; was signed on
the dotted line.</p>
<p>&quot;Here is your map of the wonderful, infinite, maddening <strong>Whoa
Zone</strong>! Enjoy buddy, but don't forget that it might take one
in a half eons to work off the debt.&quot;</p>
<p>The &quot;map&quot; by the way was an ancient looking sheet of
paper with only a face printed on it. A face with a grotesque smile,
amused most likely at the expense of someone's feelings on the
internet.</p>
<p>&quot;So a troll face?&quot; Toad grumbled. &quot;Does this
narration have to exaggerate everything? Did I even walk for miles?&quot;</p>
<p>Suddenly the original booth he visited was next door...because
Toad didn't walk for miles after all. Oops.</p>
<p>&quot;This underground freak giving you trouble?&quot; The
original guide asked the female guide.</p>
<p>&quot;This is serious. I HAVE to get home. Can I get out of here
or not?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes but that info will require another fee,&quot; the female
guide said as the male snickered. &quot;Maybe if you would let me
take that <em>racket</em> of yours for collateral..&quot;</p>
<p>The racket...</p>
<p>The racket!</p>
<p>As if Toad was no longer in control of himself, he pulled it out
and held it high above his head. The incoherent world around him went
red as Toad started to personify danger itself.</p>
<p>Oh, and this was no exaggeration...</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>Mario and his friends were at the 'Koopa and Kailey Circus'.</p>
<p>&quot;I've heard this before,&quot; Daisy complained.</p>
<p>They observed the various freaks being displayed in cages such as
a-</p>
<p>&quot;Chain Chomp mixed with a Piranha?&quot;</p>
<p>-Chain Chomp mixed with a Ptooie.</p>
<p>&quot;Close enough. Now can I get out of this dream land?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's nice to see these weirdos in cages for once,&quot;
Mario said, ignoring meta rants of Daisy completely. He took a bite
out of his corn dog. &quot;It's about time we got a day off for fun.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm hungry,&quot; Luigi complained.</p>
<p>&quot;Listen,&quot; Daisy interrupted, &quot;I've been through
this and even brutalized Mario for it-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;-So anyway Luigi, you aren't my real brother.&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi cried as everyone laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;Stop!&quot; Daisy shouted. Mario and the crew looked at her
curiously.</p>
<p>&quot;I am Princess Daisy of Sarasaland, NOT the Mushroom Kingdom!
The Mushroom King is NOT my father and I have nothing to do with your
politics. I don't think I am even really here right now. All I know
is that I was preparing for my tennis match when Toad and I had one
last drink of <em>FungusUp</em>. Then during the match I must have
blacked out or something! Now don't sit here and treat me like I'm
crazy!-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;-She's crazy, get her,&quot; Mario commanded. Toad, Luigi,
and the King approached her.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait, stay back!&quot; Daisy backed up to a tent behind her.
She was cornered. This was it. She was always the Princess to stay
out of danger, at least compared to Peach, but she would have liked
to believe her reputation had something to do with it. She took a
serious interest in physical training after Mario saved her from
Tatanga long ago and everyone knew it. These weren't her real friends
anyway, or at least she hoped, because she feared she'd have to do
something drastic.</p>
<p>&quot;What will it be, Daisy?&quot; Mario asked coldly.</p>
<p>Daisy grabbed the flowery racket and held it above her head.
Mario's face changed from a scowl to a look of terror as her vision
went red...</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>&quot;So we're all together now?&quot; Bowser asked impatiently.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah I guess,&quot; Luigi answered.</p>
<p>&quot;One big happy family!&quot; Boo cheered.</p>
<p>&quot;Umm, one step at a time, Boo,&quot; Mario said nervously.</p>
<p>&quot;Ahh! Don't run over me!&quot; Yoshi blurted out. Until then,
he had been shocked into silence by the explanation that Mario and
Bowser were friends. &quot;Oh sorry I just had a flash back to when I
was trying to find a wall outlet. So many people running out of the
doors...&quot; Yoshi seemed slightly traumatized.</p>
<p>Mario felt uneasy again. &quot;About that, I'm not a fan of this
abandoned hospital feeling. Let's head back to the rooms..&quot;</p>
<p>After an uneventful walk from the lobby to the patient area, Mario
knocked on the door, room 444. All was silent. He tried the lock. It
didn't budge. He looked back to the gang.</p>
<p>&quot;Leave it to me,&quot; Bowser said and he took a few steps
back and bent down about to charge.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait Bowser- don't-&quot;</p>
<p><em>Creak</em>!</p>
<p>The door opened, revealing Doctor Professor Koopa's aged face. He
looked straight at Mario.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello Mario and friends. Just a minute please.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Doctor, we don't have a minute. What is really going on?&quot;
Mario asked sternly.</p>
<p>He frowned, with a hint of confusion. &quot;I'm...but...the
patient confidentiality-&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser reached out and grabbed the Doctor unexpectedly. Everyone
sans Mario gasped.</p>
<p>&quot;Ack! Help!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mario,&quot; Peach plead. &quot;Stop him!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So again, what's really going on?&quot; Mario continued.
Peach gave Mario a nasty look that he ignored.</p>
<p>&quot;I b-but...&quot; the Doctor Professor stuttered.</p>
<p>Bowser yawned. &quot;The cats got this old man's tongue. Let's
just look inside already.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. Let's,&quot; Mario said, brushing past the terrified
doctor in Bowser's arms to push open the door completely. Boo, Luigi
and Yoshi reluctantly followed.</p>
<p>Toad and Daisy were exactly as before. They were connected to no
monitors or other equipment and lay as if the were simply sleep.
Mario stomped his feet.</p>
<p>&quot;Bowser? Bring him in here,&quot; he called.</p>
<p>Bowser complied and the Doctor who was previously squirming a much
as his old joints would allow went limp in Bowser's arms. Mario
walked right up to the doctors face.</p>
<p>&quot;Listen here doc, if you are doing ANYTHING to our friends-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mario!&quot; Peach scolded as she stepped in. &quot;When we
agreed to work with Bowser, we didn't agree to work with TWO
Bowsers!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Princess,&quot; Mario stuttered, &quot;It was just an act
like-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good cop, bad cop,&quot; Bowser said, &quot;Cept, we're both
kind of the bad cops right now, ha!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well you cannot just walk in and force people to do things.
Not in this hospital. Not in my hospital!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wait! I can explain,&quot; the Doctor interjected, conscious
again. &quot;It's... soap opera death syndrome!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?!&quot; everyone exclaimed. The shock made Bowser drop
him.</p>
<p>&quot;But we're video game characters,&quot; Mario said annoyed.
&quot;And that is a terrible excuse. So I will say this again: What
is wrong with our friends? Where are the other staff? Why is this
hospital empty?-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;-And are you really a Doctor and a Professor?!&quot; Bowser
added. Everyone stared at him. &quot;What? You don't find that
weird?&quot;</p>
<p>Someone pounded furiously at the door and opened it at the same
time. It was a Monty Mole wearing a bright yellow hazmat suit.</p>
<p>&quot;Jimmy M. of the Mushroom Kingdom Disease Control Unit!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What the-!?&quot; Everyone exclaimed. Doctor Professor
backed up against the wall near the window.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh no...&quot; he muttered. &quot;Nurse Nass. T must have
done this, the traitor...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Speak up, doc!&quot; Mario commanded.</p>
<p>&quot;Back off!&quot; The Doctor warned. He pulled out a seemingly
normal ink pen and aimed it at Mario. &quot;I will shoot!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Pop</strong>!</p>
<p>A glistening object flew towards Mario. Suddenly, someone shoved
him to the side, with enough force to send him towards the wall in
between Toad and Daisy's beds.</p>
<p>&quot;Mario!&quot; Everyone screamed. Luigi and Peach rushed
towards him to help him up.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm okay! But- BOWSER?!&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser was grimacing at his arm, the one that was closest to
Mario. The projectile was on the floor, having bounced off of his
thick skin.</p>
<p>&quot;Ugh, I'll be alright. You owe me one, mustache. Oww!&quot;</p>
<p>Mario rushed to his side. &quot;Bowser, are you sure you're
okay?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The doctor guy!&quot; Boo called out.</p>
<p><strong>CRASH</strong>!</p>
<p>Glass shards hit the floor as Doctor Professor hurled himself
through the window.</p>
<p>&quot;Ahhh! Wait. This is the first floor so he's probably okay,
but why didn't you do something?!&quot; Mario asked the MKDCU agent
sharply.</p>
<p>&quot;Deranged and murderous doctors are not my problem sir. So
anyway outside resources have been looking into this 'T-virus' and
this hospital is wholly unequipped for this kind of thing.&quot; He
checked Toad and Daisy's files. &quot;Yep, Toad Toad and Princess
Daisy Bloom. We're gonna have to take them away.&quot; The agent
whistled and two more suited agents, a Paratroopa and a Wiggler,
entered and wheeled the beds with Toad and Daisy on them away.</p>
<p>&quot;What the-!?&quot; Everyone exclaimed...again. Mario was the
first to regain his composure.</p>
<p>&quot;Guys, let's let them do their job. We clearly failed here,
and as much as I hate to admit it, they're probably in better hands
now,&quot; Mario groaned. He checked Bowser's arm. &quot;A hidden pen
gun. I should have known that playing 'bad cop' could put us in
danger.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What are we going to do, Mario?&quot; Peach asked.</p>
<p>&quot;We are in a hospital that someone has called the health
department on. No one knows what's going on and we've had at least
one murder attempt. Who would we normally call in these situations?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You, Mario.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And I got nothing,&quot; Mario replied with slight annoyance
at everyone's lack of concern for Bowser. His tough skin made the
attack nothing more than a scratch but it could have been worse had
Mario gotten hit. Bowser could have just saved his life.</p>
<p>&quot;By the way, thank you Bowser,&quot; he said sincerely.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't mention it, plumber,&quot; Bowser cooly replied,
though smiling revealed his true emotions. &quot;I have an idea. I
know where we can go!&quot;</p>
<p>Peach hesitated to ask. &quot;Where?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your castle, Princess,&quot; Bowser replied.</p>
<p>Peach gasped, but Bowser was right. Her personal doctor staff was
world renowned for excellency.</p>
<p>&quot;Luigi? Uh, how do you feel about this?&quot; Mario asked. &quot;I
did promise to keep you in the know from now on, bro.&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi was briefly confused at the sudden attention. &quot;I...sure
good plan! Peach's castle, but with Bowser and...&quot; his eyes
widened at the realization.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't worry bro.,&quot; Mario comforted. &quot;We will just
have to explain things like before. I'm sure they will understand.
Let's get out of here.&quot;</p>
<p>Sometimes Mario's unfailing optimism was a very bad thing, Luigi
thought. Bowser was thinking something as well:</p>
<p>&quot;I get to visit Peach's place!&quot;</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>&quot;So what's the secret to your amazing lips, Kylie?&quot; the
MKDCU driver asked.</p>
<p>&quot;You got the wrong Kylie,&quot; Kylie Koopa of the &quot;Koopa
Kronicle&quot; scolded, &quot;I ain't got no lip secrets, and I'm the
reporter here! Is this situation hot or not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know. I'm not a doctor!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ugh, then why am I interviewing you?&quot; Kylie groaned.
The ambitious reporter was often the first on the scene for &quot;The
Big Scoop&quot; but in her haste she often staged impromptu
interviews on the first person she saw. Often the wrong person.</p>
<p>Many were gathered outside of the hospital, having been sent out
by a silent alarm. Hospital staff and patients stood around anxiously
and the MKDCU truck was parked in front of the entrance. Kylie had
just arrived on the scene after the commotion triggered her sixth
sense for &quot;Scoops&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey,&quot; a Goomba MKDCU agent called to the driver, &quot;Jimmy
M. says he has the two special patients and they're heading out.&quot;
Kylie listened carefully, recording this info in her notebook.</p>
<p>&quot;Special patients havin to be evacuated from Mushroom Kingdom
East? The special disease unit needin to be called? A random guy that
just jumped out of that window other there? This IS The Big Scoop!&quot;</p>

untold story of what happened between Toad and Daisy! This is

<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p><strong>In the hospital</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Since your airship dropped you off, how were you planning to
get home?&quot; Mario casually asked Bowser as he and the rest headed
away from room 444.</p>
<p>&quot;Your car.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I came by bus.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well shoot. I was looking forward to arguing with you all
the way home.&quot; Bowser smiled.</p>
<p>Mario pretended it ignore it and shrugged. &quot;We could argue in
a taxi.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well whatever, but you'd better split the bill RIGHT this
time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bowser, the charge was an odd number. And I paid a coin more
than you!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, but it's the principle that counts. What, you think I
can't afford to pay the larger bill?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I was just being nice-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is going to take some getting used to,&quot; Luigi
thought out loud.</p>
<p>&quot;TELL ME ABOUT IT,&quot; Peach blurted out, but in an instant
she was back to herself. &quot;I mean, oh dear. We'd better hurry!&quot;
She marched ahead of the others in an obviously uncomfortable way but
stopped suddenly around the corner.</p>
<p>&quot;What's wrong Princess?&quot; Mario asked.</p>
<p>The beds could not fit though the normal sized lobby doors, and so
the MKDCU agents hadn't left the hospital yet and looked quite
foolish.</p>
<p>&quot;Why didn't you tell us to use the over size emergency exit
in the first place!&quot; Jimmy M. complained to someone on the
phone. His companions continued to stand behind Toad and Daisy's
beds.</p>
<p>&quot;Need any help?&quot; Mario asked as he and the gang caught
up with Peach in the lobby. Jimmy M. looked his way begrudgingly.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, no sir. We gots this under control. It's just a matter
or wheeling the patients to the over size emergency entrance which
is...&quot; The mole trailed off as he squinted at a map of the
hospital.</p>
<p>&quot;On the other side of the hospital,&quot; Peach chipped in.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. Very well, thank you,&quot; Jimmy thanked her cordially
though his face revealed his annoyance. &quot;Wiggletron, exactly how
far is that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Mushroom Hospital East over size emergency entrance is
appropriately 1.5 miles away from our current location. Destination
will be reached in 3000 steps, sir,&quot; the Wiggler explained
mechanically.</p>
<p>Jimmy groaned. &quot;Let's get to it then-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wait!&quot; Luigi shouted. Everyone looked to him.</p>
<p>&quot;Er, uh. I have an idea?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What, Weegee?&quot; Mario asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Well...Boo!&quot; Luigi called.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, bae?&quot; Boo addressed him.</p>
<p>&quot;Your powers. Maybe you can-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Teleport you guys out of the building! Why didn't I think of
this? Luigi, you remember my powers better than I do!&quot; Boo
blushed. Luigi blushed back, but before anything interesting could
happen, Jimmy put his foot down.</p>
<p>&quot;Hold up, we are prohibited by...Parabilly, what's that
protocol again?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mushroom Kingdom Disease Control Unit Law Protocol #103. You
can't be sendin' patients under the care of us MKDCU through no
dimension tamperin', sir!&quot; the Koopa Paratroopa explained in a
thick drawl. &quot;And that includes teleportin'!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, that. Thems just the rules you see? Now step aside
and-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's up with them now?&quot; Yoshi asked. The rest of the
gang took a closer look at their unfortunate friends and noticed a
change.</p>
<p>No longer did Toad and Daisy look peacefully asleep for the most
part. Now, they looked like they were having a very bad dream. A bad
dream that involved them both clutching their tennis rackets!</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, since when did they even have those?&quot; Mario asked
no one in particular.</p>
<p>&quot;Hmm. Yeah that's weird- MOVE OUT!&quot; Jimmy ordered his
companions. They obeyed readily and wheeled the beds around.</p>
<p>&quot;Hang on!&quot; Mario protested. &quot;Didn't you hear?
Something weird is going on here because they didn't look like that
before. Shouldn't we check this out?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, I thought you guys were on our side,&quot; Luigi
added.</p>
<p>The MKDCU ignored their rants and continued down the hall. Bowser
started to follow, catching the attention of Peach immediately.</p>
<p>&quot;Bowser!&quot; she called out, &quot;No more brutish
behavior, remember?&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser looked back and smiled condescendingly. &quot;Princess, no
offense, you know I like ya but- I don't take orders from you! I
agreed to help y'all out and I'm going to do so. MY way!&quot; Bowser
continued to steadily walk towards the departing agents.</p>
<p>&quot;But brute force isn't the way- Mario! Stop him!&quot; Peach
plead, turning her attention to Mario.</p>
<p>Mario contemplated for a moment and then turned to Luigi suddenly.
&quot;Bro, please get everyone to the castle safely. I'll meet you
guys there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But-&quot; Luigi and Peach started.</p>
<p>&quot;Do it!&quot; Mario commanded as he ran after Bowser. Within
seconds he had disappeared around the corner.</p>
<p>Peach stared down the hallway they'd just been in as did Luigi.
Peach was feeling abandoned and helpless, Luigi, a burning rage.</p>
<p>Mario had abandoned them for Bowser.</p>
<p><em>Again</em>.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p><strong>Peach's Castle</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Dear Eldstar!&quot; Toadsworth exclaimed as he pace back and
forth. &quot;The Princess is not back, I know she is supposedly with
Master Mario but-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Whoa,&quot; Buckenberry said. The blue capped Toad was
viewing something from his Facebook feed. &quot;I have to tell
Peach!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tell her WHAT, young man?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Didn't you see? Someone posted that they thought the saw a
Chain-Chomp mixed with a Ptooie at MK East hospital!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I do not trust what those doohickeys say. Our Princess is
out looking after a dear friend and our lead advisor. You will not
disturb her with silly internet stories!&quot; Toadsworth warned.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, whatever,&quot; Buckenberry said as exited the throne
room. He stood by his post in the hallway and texted his girlfriend,
Toadette.</p>
<p>&quot;Toadette, hey baby. What's up?&quot;</p>
<p>She responded: &quot;<em>Writing my college thesis. *book emoji</em>*&quot;</p>
<p>Buckenberry and Toadette would normally be on hall duty together,
partly as their job and also as a date. Recently however, her
studying for college was interfering with this, and the Nsmb veteran
was on hallway duty alone.</p>
<p>She continued: &quot;<em>MKDCU is at *hospital emoji*. Their bus
driver just posted about it on Instagram</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sounds serious. You think this has to do with before?&quot;</p>
<p>She replied: &quot;<em>What</em>?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;At the tennis match, Daisy and Toad collapsed and the game
was canceled. And so I think they are there. That's why Peach left.&quot;</p>
<p>She replied: &quot;<em>What? Toad? Which Toad?&quot;</em></p>
<p>&quot;Toad Toad. You know...your ex...&quot;</p>
<p>She replied: &quot;<em>OMG I had no idea he was Daisy's tennis
partner. I thought they hated each other. I'm heading right over to
the castle</em>!&quot;</p>
<p>Buckenberry frowned, feeling slightly jealous. Despite his recent
escapades with the Mario Bros as a backup hero, he'd still never
compare to the illustrious Toad Toad.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p><strong>Flashback</strong></p>
<p>Toad and Daisy were in their locker rooms before the much
anticipated match between them and Mario and Bowser.</p>
<p>&quot;What up, my homegirl Daisy!&quot; Toad greeted though his
megaphone. (Yep it's back!)</p>
<p>Daisy rolled her eyes. &quot;So, I hear you've recently broken up
with Toadette?&quot; Daisy asked in an attempt to converse normally.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh huh,&quot; Toad said winking. &quot;I'm back on the
market, baby.&quot;</p>
<p>So much for conversation Daisy thought. &quot;Okay, game plan: you
stay in the back and I make the shots.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No way. I've been training! And...I might have gotten
genetically enhanced a while back by a thunder cloud. But still, I
can do this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, Toad,&quot; Daisy grumbled. &quot;I can't have my record
ruined by a speed character!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Excuse me, you Peach clone!-&quot; Toad stuck his tongue
out.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh no you didn't, you little-&quot;</p>
<p>Someone knocked on the locker room door.</p>
<p>&quot;Ooh, must be a fan of mine!&quot; Toad said.</p>
<p>&quot;How do you know it's not one of my fans?&quot; Daisy asked
defensively.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't kid yourself,&quot; Toad replied with a smirk. Before
Daisy could smack him, he opened the door to reveal two lime green
sodas that had been left on the floor.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>FungusUp</em>?&quot; Toad asked, picking up the drinks.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>The only drink that springs up overnight</em>?&quot;
Toad and Daisy said, quoting the infamous slogan. They looked at each
other surprisingly.</p>
<p>&quot;Daisy, I thought I was the only one that remembered these! I
would binge on a ton of em during overnight watches at Peach's
place.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Me too, Toad. I remember when they were discontinued and we
couldn't import them anymore to Sarasaland. I never thought I'd see
one again!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You think-&quot; Toad started, &quot;Someone really is a fan
of us both. How would they know about our favorite discontinued
drink?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe so. Either way, hand mine over!&quot; Daisy said,
reaching for one of the cans. She glanced nostalgically at the cheesy
logo but then noticed the expiration date.</p>
<p>&quot;Umm, maybe we shouldn't-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Daisy come on! I saw the date too, but I eat expired stuff
all of the time. Here goes nothing!&quot;</p>
<p>Toad popped the can. The carbonated drink hissed appealingly. Toad
wasted no time and took a big gulp.</p>
<p>&quot;Whooo hooo!&quot; he yelled, sounding almost like his MK64
self again. &quot;Come on, try it. It tastes just like before!&quot;</p>
<p>Daisy stared at the icy cold can in her hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Come on, or...are you gonna be like Peach?&quot; Toad
teased.</p>
<p>&quot;Excuse me?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry, but no one knows Peach like I do, and she wouldn't
dare drink FungusUp. She was always too afraid of what the caffeine
might do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I ain't afraid of nothing! Look here!&quot; Daisy popped the
can open and tried to chug it down. The moment the soda hit her
tongue, the memories of her rambunctious past came back vividly. The
sneaking in the royal kitchen at midnight...The street fights she'd
secretly get in while on a caffeine trip...The soda caps she'd
collect in a vain effort to get &quot;free&quot; prizes...Proudly
wearing FungusUp branded t-shirts to the dismay of her royal
family...</p>
<p>Then, the memories faded... She'd finished the whole thing.</p>
<p>&quot;Ha ha! Well?&quot; Toad asked, observing Daisy who stood
looking totally lost. &quot;Good right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;YEEEAAAHHH DAISY!&quot; She did a triple backflip which
resulted in her hair band falling off. She immediately regained her
composure.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, sorry about that. That drink sent me...out of this
world...Anyway you'd better finish yours soon, Toad. It's almost
time!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah yeah,&quot; Toad said. &quot;Want me to hang on to that
hair accessory thing? It's bound to fall off with your crazy antics!&quot;</p>
<p>Daisy ignored the insult. &quot;Sure, Mushroom head. Now hurry
up!&quot;</p>

<p>Mushroom Kingdom East Hospital was reasonably famous due to it's
relatively small but top notch staff, close proximity to Toad Town,
and most importantly it being officially sanctioned by Princess Peach
herself. The building represented hope for all those entrusted to its
care.</p>
<p>Now however, it was a place of despair. The hospital staff were
grouchy and the patients confused and scared. It was cold. It was now
late. They continued to wait in the grassy lot in front the hospital
while the MKDCU supposedly did their job. Problem was, it was taking
seemingly forever and their oversized truck blocking the entrance was
still there. Worse still, since fifteen minutes ago a Channel 64 News
Airship had been hovering over the hospital, no doubt spreading bad
publicity like a wildfire.</p>
<p>One member of the crowd marched straight to the MKDCU truck. The
short sunglasses wearing Noki wasn't a doctor or a patient, but a
bystander that had noticed the madness.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello? I need to speak to whomever is in charge!&quot; he
asked authoritatively.</p>
<p>The Snifit driver perked up. &quot;Who's talking?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah-hem, I'm down here. People are sick and dying. Literally.
What's going on?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh about that! Boss said that-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, stop revealing stuff to bystanders!&quot; the Goomba
agent guarding the door scolded the driver.</p>
<p>&quot;Right, sorry! I'm not allowed to tell you that it's going to
take longer because they came to the wrong-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sebastian, you idiot! You're doing it again! Why don't you
tell him all of our company secrets while you're at it? Who are you
anyway, pipsqueak?&quot; the Goomba suddenly addressed the black
shelled Noki. He turned to face him calmly.</p>
<p>&quot;The name's Bond. Jelectro Bond.&quot; He walked away,
fiddling with something on his phone.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, wait!&quot; a girl called as she caught up to him. &quot;I'm
Kylie Koopa of the Koopa Kronicle!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No interviews,&quot; Bond replied without taking his focus
off of his phone.</p>
<p>&quot;You don't understand mister, this situation is stranger than
a Yoshi that's a picky eater!&quot;</p>
<p>Bond looked up finally to the taller Koopa. &quot;Listen young
lady, I know this is dangerous. You'd better write your little book
report AFTER we have all of the bad guys put away.&quot; He continued
forward.</p>
<p>&quot;But-but, I saw a guy jump out of that window over there!&quot;
Kylie called out. Bond stopped.</p>
<p>&quot;Hm. That one over there?&quot; He pointed to the broken
window.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh huh, and it was right after those agents walked in.
That's fishier than a Cheep Cheep party ain't it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was wondering about that. In fact I was just now trying to
hack into the security cameras to see what's really going on inside.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You can do that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hm. Now I'm the one talking too much. Thank you for the tip,
but I have to go. Don't give me that face, madam. Maybe we will meet
again!&quot;</p>
<p>The mysterious Noki disappeared into the night's darkness before
Kylie could follow.</p>
<p>&quot;Aww, I let em get away!&quot;</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>&quot;Bowser!&quot; Mario called as he caught up to the slowly but
steadily moving Koopa King.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Mario,&quot; he said smugly, &quot;You just couldn't get
enough of me, could ya? Ha! You gonna get on me too?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm here for backup,&quot; Mario said. Bowser raised an
eyebrow.</p>
<p>&quot;I know a shortcut to that exit. We'll be waiting before
those agents get there and then we can-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hold on, plumber! Is this really you?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Er, yeah?...I told the rest to wait at the castle. We're
gonna get our friends there if it's the last thing we do!&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser started to laugh.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I mean MY friends...&quot; Mario corrected.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not laughing at that. As if this day couldn't get more
strange!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Excuse me?&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser shrugged, &quot;I don't know, I just was sure we would have
punched each other in the face at least once by now. And to think, we
were just at each other's throats at that last Mario Kart. Now look
at us!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Look at us what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stop being dense, mustache. We are working TOGETHER. We're
on the same page as opposed to the same battle field preparing to
fight. Are we still frenemies or actual friends now? &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pretty sure it's still frenemies. I wouldn't want you over
at my place.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Really. Cause I'd want you over mine, to crush ya! Ha ha!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very funny...&quot; Mario said flatly.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, serious talk, mustache. I just never thought I would
be listening to ya and not hating it. It kind of warps my mind
actually, more than Super Paper Mario did! Tell anyone I said this
and I'll roast ya, but I'm mildly enjoying your company.&quot; Bowser
smiled.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh?&quot; Mario flushed, &quot;Uh, okay then. Actually I-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;AHHHHH!&quot; someone screamed from ahead.</p>
<p>The hero and villain looked to each other in surprise. The scream
came from just around the corner.</p>
<p>&quot;You think that's?-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously, plumber. Let's go!&quot;</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>&quot;Sebastian,&quot; the Goomba agent called.</p>
<p>&quot;What, Dick?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What did you think of that Bond guy? It's like straight out
of a movie or something.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, like an action movie or something.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I just said that! Anyway- You guard the door, my feet are
killing me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Aww!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Come on, you lazy fool!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Alright,&quot; the Snifit muttered as he jumped out of the
truck. Just then-</p>
<p><strong>Bam</strong>!</p>
<p>The hospital's front door slammed open, knocking Dick into the
bushes. In a flash, something green exited the building.</p>
<p>&quot;Luigi, wait!&quot; Boo called from the doorway. Luigi
continued to march into the crowd, unfazed. As Boo moved forward as a
nurse walked up.</p>
<p>&quot;Can we enter now?&quot; Nass T. asked impatiently.</p>
<p>Boo attempted to dodge her, but she blocked the way. &quot;Were...you
talking to me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. I don't care that you are a Boo. Can we enter or not?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure, whatever. Could you please let me go?&quot; Boo
finally squeezed past her and disappeared into the crowd as well.</p>
<p>Nass T. whistled and immediately there was a stampede of staff and
patients cramming though the two door wide entrance.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait! Don't!&quot; Dick shouted from the bushes, &quot;Sebastian,
do something!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right! Uh...uh oh. I'm locked out of the truck!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;WHAT!?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Send these news reporters away and get that news airship out
of the sky. Also have someone tow this annoying truck,&quot; Nass T.
complained to an onsight security guard, &quot;It's partially
blocking the entrance.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You wench,&quot; Dick grumbled as he shook leaves from his
suit. &quot;Listen, this illness is serious and your
duty-interrupting-loud-mouthed self is in our way! Our agents are
still in there but you have anyone rushing inside! That's against our
protocol!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That is unfortunate, isn't it?&quot; Nass T. hissed,
entering the building.</p>
<p>Dick groaned. He wanted to do something, but what he had in mind
would definitely be against protocol, and pretty much illegal.</p>
<p>&quot;Sebastian!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;W-what did I do now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing! Just...ugh, I don't even know. Jimmy isn't
responding on the radio for some reason so who we gonna call?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Jelectro Bond!&quot; Kylie said running up to them.</p>
<p>&quot;What? That is the least stupid thing you've said all day!
Wait, who said that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Me, and MOVE QUICK!&quot; she warned. Dick moved away from
the entrance just in time avoid getting stepped on by Sumo Bro.</p>
<p>She continued, &quot;And lighten up, brother. I saw the whole
thing and I now see that you aren't crooked after all. Maybe we can
help each other out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Me?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, come on will ya?&quot; She moved away from the crowd to
a more secluded area. Dick looked around to see his partner still
panicking at the crowd. He decided to follow Kylie after all. Despite
being more ticked off than an Angry Sun, he was curious about things
himself.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to find Bond,&quot; she continued. &quot;So far, my
research shows that at least one nurse and one doctor from here are
more shady than Twilight Town!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You think?! That Nass. T is...NASTY!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tell me about it...&quot; Kylie flipped through some more
notes. &quot;Oh! And this ain't no natural virus either.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh huh, keep telling me what I already know. It's not like
we're short on time or anything.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But do you know this? This sounds like Mushroom Flu!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You sure? Our case file says there are no rashes or any
other typical symptoms in the victims. What, you're a doctor now?&quot;</p>
<p>Annoyed, Kylie continued, &quot;Listen here, brother. I've covered
a story like this before and advanced strands of it can cause victims
to go into comas straight away, like bam! Only symptoms then are
crazy amounts of brain activity and eventually coma-walking!&quot;</p>
<p>He thought for a moment. &quot;Well...yeah, I do remember
something like that in rare cases. Why do you even care though? Don't
annoying reporter brats like you cover criminal cases only?&quot;</p>
<p>Kylie ignored the insult. &quot;Yes, that's where I'm getting at!
As you should know, the virus is now dormant and can only be made in
a lab. And what is the only lab that's been known reanimate dormant
viruses? Bowser's!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bowser you say? Sounds more like something those
illegitimate children of his might cook up. Wonder if he's around?&quot;
Dick asked, now fully invested.</p>
<p>Kylie laughed. &quot;Like that guy would be hanging around Mario
and friends! Anyway, you're sharp, because the Koopalings are exactly
where my research was going. But there's one problem...&quot; She
nervously fidgeted with her notebook. &quot;Thing is brother, even a
top-shot reporter like me has no business dealing with Bowser's
shenanigans alone. Now, I'll do anything for a top story but ever
since I dealt with time travel I've tried to be more careful.
Jelectro Bond is the only one I'd trust for help with this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; Dick muttered, &quot;I guess I will help you
find Bond. He has to be meddling around here somewhere, but then I
have to report back to my fellow agents. No telling what's going on
in there!&quot; He motioned towards the hospital. &quot;One question
though. Why did you single out me?&quot;</p>
<p>Kylie smiled. &quot;Because even though you're more abrasive than
a Pokey's back, I see you're smart enough to be packing heat!&quot;
she said, referring to the very visible Fire Flower on Dick's tool
belt.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh heh heh, that. Fine girl, I'll work with you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;K! It's a deal, brother!&quot; Kylie said, reaching towards
the Goomba for a hand shake. &quot;Oh right...&quot; she apologized.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>In an instant, the hospital was bustling like before, despite the
late hour. It was as if nothing had changed. As soon as she could
fight through the crowd, Peach exited, fuming much like Luigi before.</p>
<p>&quot;Princess! Wait!&quot; Yoshi called.</p>
<p>&quot;What now?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, can I get a lift with you to the castle?&quot;</p>
<p>Peach paused at this, and somewhat regained her composure. &quot;I
suppose so.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ok... I'm calling Birdo to pick us up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You don't need to do that. I can call my folks, I'm sure
Toadsworth is worried sick. Let me use your phone.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ok Princess, but I thought you had a phone?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Toadsworth doesn't allow me anymore. Something like 'anyone
can contact you with those things'.&quot;</p>
<p>Yoshi suppressed a laugh. &quot;Isn't that the point of a phone?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; Peach said slyly, &quot;I do still have a
phone, but he doesn't know about it. Obviously I can't call the
castle from my secret phone!&quot;</p>
<p>Yoshi handed over the phone, and soon a castle guard was on the
way to pick them up. Little did they know, they were being watched...</p>

<p><strong>Life lessons/ Fun facts (but mostly facts)</strong></p>
<p><strong>-A guy named Jelectro Bond is actually not a Jelectro, but
a Noki. Strange, I know.</strong></p>
<p><strong>-Speaking of Bond: He's a real secret agent in this
universe as opposed to a movie star. That's why only the ever savvy
Kylie Koopa really knows his deal.</strong></p>
<p><strong>-A Goomba named &quot;Dick&quot; is less vulgar than it
seems. It's only referring to personality , so it's less rude!</strong></p>

<p>&quot;What? This is your idea?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh huh, we'll be able to see everything from the rooftop!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But...all the way up there?!&quot;</p>
<p>The ambious reporter and the MKDCU agent had snuck around in the
dark to the side of the hospital where the emergency ladder to the
roof top was. The plan was simple, at least in Kylie's young but
decisive mind. They would scout out the area from the roof for Bond.
It would surely work, she though. Besides that dashing Bond guy had
promised to see her again...That is, if Kylie wasn't imagining that
part.</p>
<p>&quot;Come on, brother! Don't be a...well...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; Dick shot back.</p>
<p>&quot;Just climb!&quot; Kylie watched him climb from the ground
until he was about ten feet or so up. &quot;Wow brother, you're good
at climbing,&quot; she called up. &quot;Especially for a big ol'
goomba!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Impressive indeed. He had better hang on to the safety rails
though,&quot; Jelectro Bond warned as he walked up behind her.</p>
<p>&quot;Bond?!&quot; Kylie shouted, scaring Dick and making him fall
off the ladder in a thud.</p>
<p>&quot;Yow! You little brat!-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hm. Look at the time,&quot; said Bond, glancing at his
'Rolex Submariner', &quot;Its not safe to sneaking around at this
hour.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bond.&quot; Kylie started, &quot;How did you-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I succeeded in hacking the cameras, and you two looking
mighty suspicious was the first thing I saw.&quot; Bond's tone was
serious, but not harsh.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yeah. Bond,&quot; the angry Goomba spat, getting up. &quot;Aka
that pipsqueak from before...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah-hem, yes Richard. So madam,&quot; he now addressed Kylie,
&quot;I understand that you need some assistance.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes siree! I don't know how you know that, but we do! We
need to investigate Bowser's Castle, pronto!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No doubt because of the the illnesses, correct? Hm. I was
afraid that fiend would have something to do with this. After all,
he's targeting Mario's dear friends.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well actually our agent buddy brought up something
interesting. Didn't you?&quot; she addressed Dick.</p>
<p>&quot;Huh? Oh yeah uh, maybe his meddling kids are involved. But I
ain't telling you all of my confidential agent theory stuff, 'Mr.
wears-sunglasses-at-night'!&quot;</p>
<p>Bond chuckled softly. &quot;My dear uncooperative Richard. Of
course this plan would be too 'complicated' for Bowser alone, mes
amies.&quot;</p>
<p>Dick sighed. &quot;Yeah yeah. How'd you know my name?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's on the bracelet on your leg.&quot; Bond said, motioning
towards it.</p>
<p><em>It read: Richard Goomba. Giant Land Disease Control Special
Agent.</em></p>
<p>&quot;So you MKDCU agents aren't necessarily locals aren't you?&quot;
he continued, &quot;Hm. This is serious.&quot;</p>
<p>Dick raised one eyebrow. &quot;Well you got sharp eye, shortie.
Anyway, I have to scram. We found ya, or you found us after all.
Sneaking around like that..You aren't half Boo are you?&quot;</p>
<p>Bond smiled. &quot;No, I won't be dead until another day,
hopefully! I know you have your duties to attend to, but I suggest we
keep in touch. Here.&quot; Bond gave him a radio device. &quot;Needless
to say, this is a secret operation. Don't let your fellow agents see
it.&quot;</p>
<p>It was a BooTracker turbo radio, made for the most stealthy of
operations and miles ahead of the bargain bin radios the MKDCU were
supplied with. It really was like this guy was straight out of a
movie!</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks,&quot; Dick muttered, trying not to sound too
excited.</p>
<p>&quot;You are welcome mon ami, you'd better go now.&quot;</p>
<p>Dick mumbled something affirmative as he headed back towards the
hospital's main entrance. Bond turned sharply to Kylie.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, listen here. You must follow my instructions
carefully. You understand, madam?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes-siree!&quot; she beamed, &quot;Anything to save Mario's
friends and for the 'Scoop' of course!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good. Now what do you know about Bowser's Castle and the
kingdom of Dark Land? I understand you've won twenty or so journalism
awards?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know how you know that either but, sure! I know it's
a dictatorship, though a lax one, not very diplomatic, no osha
compliance, low cost of living. Oh, and not very friendly to citizens
that aren't alliances with Bowser.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hm. Political discrimination, I will definitely have to pay
a visit,&quot; he chuckled. &quot;Okay, mon amie. Let's go.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, where?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You'll see,&quot; he replied slyly.</p>
<p>Bond lead the way towards the street to a silver car waiting in
the darkness. Kylie's jaw dropped. His car was an Aston Mushroom!</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>After the setback involving the main entrance doors being too
narrow, the MKDCU retraced their steps to head towards the alternate
exit. Jimmy M., the leader of the pack, lead the way while Wiggletron
and Parabilly wheeled the beds of Toad and Daisy. Halfway through the
uneventful walk, Jimmy ordered a brief stop near the children's zone
to get some fountain water. The area was small, smaller than the main
lobby and decorated in a more colorful and cheerful way. Children
sized chairs and piles of toys littered the floor as Jimmy's slurping
echoed loudly.</p>
<p>&quot;Ha ha! This lil walk has ya THAT worn out?&quot; Parabilly
teased.</p>
<p>&quot;Do not *pant* question my *pant* athleticism!&quot; Jimmy
replied before taking another huge gulp of the fountain water. Water
splashed everywhere, dripping from the fur on his face to his yellow
hazmat suit. Parabilly held back laughter as Wiggletron face palmed.</p>
<p>&quot;Please control your indulgence in order to leave some of the
resources for our aquatic acquaintances,&quot; Wiggletron snarked in
his own way.</p>
<p>During this exchange Daisy and Toad lifted up from their beds in a
jolt.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey!&quot; Parabilly exclaimed, as Jimmy lifted up from the
fountain.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, well. The patients are no longer unconscious,&quot;
Wiggletron droned, &quot;Permission to initiate patient examination?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Umm, wait just a second Wiggs. Toad Toad and Daisy Bloom?
You twos know where yer at?&quot; Jimmy asked Toad and Daisy.</p>
<p>Toad suddenly hopped off the bed. He turned around and flipped it
over with a wicked grin. Wiggletron immediately restrained him,
making Toad scream wildly. Before anyone could react, Daisy made a
dive for for Jimmy. She and the unsuspecting mole hit the floor.
Parabilly screamed like a girl and hid behind a over sized doll house
as Jimmy wiggled out of the Daisy's grasp and made a mad dash towards
the hallway. Daisy staggered after him for a moment, but was then
distracted by something. She looked towards children's toys with a
psychotic smile.</p>
<p>&quot;Code Lightning! Code Lightning!&quot; Jimmy screamed into
his radio. Then he realized that the entire back half of the
communicative device had fallen off and was on the floor near the
fountain. The cheap standard issue thing had broken as they tended to
do.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay. Think Jimmy, think!&quot; he thought out loud. &quot;We
uh,- whoa!&quot;</p>
<p><em>Whoosh</em>!</p>
<p>A toy airship was hurled towards Jimmy at 101 mph. (Nice!) He
dodged just in time and the toy shot down the hallway, braking on
impact. Daisy stood on the mist of the pile of unkempt toys,
playfully spinning the racket in her hands as she stared down Jimmy
with her reddened but focused eyes. The portly but experienced
agent's heart raced. He and his team inside had no weapons. Sure,
they had some in their truck, but what good was that here? After all,
they were supposed to be dealing with unconscious patients! The only
option now was peaceful restraint, at least according to protocol
#88, maybe with a touch of protocol #45 too.</p>
<p>&quot;Wiggs! Help!-&quot; Jimmy called as he dodged the
projectiles Daisy shot at him.</p>
<p>&quot;MKDCU Protocol #45: Protect fellow agents at any cost is
being followed. I must restrain the most immediate threat, and that
is Toad,&quot; Wiggletron said flatly as a tempestuous Toad bashed
him in the head repeatedly with his racket. Not that Wiggletron
seemed bothered by this.</p>
<p>&quot;Aww, shucks! We shoulda brought our dern tazers, Jimmy,&quot;
Parabilly cried from behind the dollhouse, &quot;Or at least took
them rackets away!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's going on?!&quot; Mario asked as he and Bowser rounded
the corner.</p>
<p>The agents froze. Toad and Daisy ceased their attack and looked
towards them in a trance like state.</p>
<p>&quot;Daisy?&quot; Mario asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Toad?&quot; Bowser asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Mario?&quot; Jimmy asked.</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>&quot;What? No one's gonna say my name?&quot; Bowser groaned.</p>
<p>&quot;Help us!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And did that doll house just scream for help?&quot;</p>
<p>As if on cue, Toad and Daisy resumed their assault. Toad squirmed
and screamed again as Daisy continued to practice her deadly serves,
this time alternating between Jimmy, Mario, and Bowser.</p>
<p>&quot;What the Bonzai Bill!?&quot; Mario exclaimed as he ducked
away from a flying mini Mario toy. &quot;When did they wake up?
What's wrong with them?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And if- yow!&quot; Bowser took a direct hit from a hard
plastic Koopa doll, &quot;...And if you try to give us the runaround
when it comes to answers, we'll treat ya like we did the old doc back
there!&quot; Bowser warned despite his obvious pain.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't know!&quot; Jimmy yelled back. &quot;-And as if
we'd hide something like that from you twos. You gots weapons,
right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, unless these guns count,&quot; Bowser said, showing off
one bicep. He glanced towards Wiggletron. &quot;Besides, you have
'Terminator' over there. Have him use lasers or something!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Weapons?! Lasers?!&quot; Mario said appallingly.</p>
<p>&quot;Wiggs is a *pant* pacifist anyway,&quot; Jimmy huffed, worn
out again from all the dodging, &quot;He wouldn't hurt a Fly Guy.
*pant* Of course, he'd restrain one though. Wait. Why aren't we
getting shot anymores?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ahhhhhh!&quot; Parabilly screamed. Daisy had finally noticed
him and had him cornered behind the doll house.</p>
<p>&quot;Daisy, it's me! Mario!&quot; Mario called to get her
attention.</p>
<p>As soon as she heard his name, she turned slowly towards him. Fire
was in her eyes as her grip tightened on the tennis racket. Mario
hesitated but approached slowly.</p>
<p>&quot;Listen,&quot; he started in a calm tone, &quot;In case you
don't remember, we were having a tennis game and you fell out in the
middle of it. You and Toad have been out all day, and no one knows
why.&quot;</p>
<p>She huffed loudly and continued to stare him down as Parabilly
slowly inched away from behind her. Mario accidentally stepped on a
toy Cataquack, emitting a loud squeak. Parabilly made a mad dash away
and Daisy turn her attention to him again.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait wait! Daisy!&quot; Mario called again, &quot;Listen, so
these guys right here in the suits? They are here to help...Well,
they are supposed to be...&quot; Mario was now an arms length away
from Daisy.</p>
<p>&quot;And so, I glad to see you all awake now and maybe-&quot;</p>
<p><em>Thwack</em>!</p>
<p>Mario hit the floor.</p>
<p>&quot;Mario!&quot; Bowser and Jimmy screamed. In a d&eacute;j&agrave;
vu, Bowser rushed to Mario without thought.</p>
<p>Right after the assault with intent to gameover, Daisy went
straight for Wiggletron swinging.</p>
<p><em>Thud</em>!</p>
<p>Wiggletron ignored the hit and without a beat, he grabbed her with
his other set of arms. Now Daisy screamed hysterically. Over the
chaos Wiggletron declared, &quot;Patients are restrained.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Whoa! We did it? With no broken bones!&quot; Jimmy cheered.</p>
<p>&quot;Ye-Ha!&quot; Parabilly hollered.</p>
<p>&quot;Billy, you didn't do a thing,&quot; Jimmy scolded. &quot;I
will be reporting your failure of protocol to the agency. Now pick up
these beds!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Aww, shucks, Jimmy,&quot; he whimpered while obeying, &quot;You
know how them nerves of mine-.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hey people! What's wrong with y'all?&quot; Bowser
interrupted. &quot;Plumber down! I repeat. Plumber down! Do something
Benny!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's Jimmy!.. Uh, give em a Mushroom or something. Who gots
a power up?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Me,&quot; Dick said as he rounded the corner. &quot;Wow, how
long does it take to walk through a door designed for fat people?!
Anyway, what sorry sapsucker needs it?&quot; The Mega Goomba walked
casually next to Wiggletron and directly in the way of Parabilly, who
was picking up the beds.</p>
<p>Jimmy groaned. &quot;Agent Richard, we CLEARLY had some delays
here. Deploy that Fire Flower to Mario over here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mario you say? Mario and...B-Bowser?!&quot; Dick stammered,
suddenly remembering his conversations with Kylie and Bond.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Richard,&quot; Jimmy said through clinched teeth.</p>
<p>&quot;Hand over the flower!&quot; Bowser demanded. &quot;Plumber
boy here will be in another realm if he takes one more hit!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah yeah. Why do you care about Mario so much anyway, hot
shot?&quot; Dick asked, trying sound defensive, though is voice
wavered a bit.</p>
<p>Bowser growled. &quot;Because, you oversized fungi, NO ONE defeats
Mario but me!&quot;</p>
<p>Dick reluctantly approached them. Despite being born and raised in
Giant Land, a land neutral to Bowser (aside from one past invasion),
Dick still had some ingrained fear of the Koopa King.</p>
<p>&quot;Bout time!&quot; Bowser snatched the Fire Flower and shoved
it in Mario's mouth. Mario eyes immediately popped open.</p>
<p>&quot;Phew! What was that?!&quot; Mario screamed as he jolted up.
He spat out leaves.</p>
<p>&quot;A Fire Flower?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You don't eat a Fire Flower! You absorb it by holding on to
it!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well it worked, didn't it mustache?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well yeah but...&quot; Mario looked around. &quot;Wait. So
that wasn't a dream?&quot;</p>
<p>While they spoke, Dick whispered to Jimmy.</p>
<p>&quot;Jimmy, I need to speak to you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not now, agent.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;EHOUGH!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Listen here,&quot; Dick said sternly, returning to his old
self, &quot;A meddling nurse towed our truck! Worse still, people are
back in the building. It wont be long before they come back here.
Lastly, maybe this is Mushroom Flu after all!&quot;</p>
<p>Dick immediately regretted that last part. Wasn't he supposed to
keep the theories shared between him, Kylie and Bond secret?</p>
<p>&quot;Excuse me?&quot; Jimmy perked up.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing, Jim. We'd better go. We wouldn't want to break
protocol would we? I'm coding for another truck right now,&quot; He
whispered back. &quot;Sebastian is waiting in the front being
useless.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Patients are in dire need of proper examination,&quot;
Wiggletron droned after whistling for everyone's attention.
&quot;Also...ouch my cranium...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ugh. Let's go before Wiggs gets permanent damage from those
rascals! Now! Quick! Hurry! Leave the beds!&quot; Jimmy announced as
he hightailed it.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes sir!&quot; Parabilly said as he and Wiggletron followed
suit. Dick lingered behind to glance at the bewildered Bowser and
Mario.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm watching you, fatty.&quot; Dick warned, glaring at
Bowser. He then followed the others.</p>
<p>&quot;Mario, get up. They're taking them away! Again!&quot; Bowser
pulled Mario up forceably.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; Mario said groggily, &quot;Could we
really take them to Peach's Castle while they're on murderous
rampages? Also, you can let me go now..&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yeah...&quot; Bowser let go and distanced himself in a
&quot;manly&quot; way, then stomped the ground. &quot;It's like we
did this for nothing and I can't even put the blame on anyone else!&quot;</p>
<p>Mario rubbed his head. &quot;Ouch. Daisy should have been a power
character in the games! Let's go. It's not like we could have fought
them or changed anything. Maybe it really is for the better...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We need to get back to the rest, or they'll never trust us
again!&quot; A crowd could be heard in the background.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yeah. I guess even you can't lie forever.&quot; Bowser
said nonchalantly. Mario made a face. &quot;Well you're welcome,
plumber! I've only been your savior, buddy cop, and therapist
lately!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I guess so. Thank you, and I mean it... What did that giant
Goomba guy mean anyway?&quot; Mario quickly changed the subject.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey you two!&quot; A nurse addressed them.</p>
<p>They turned around to see a familiar black haired Toad nurse. Nass
T. continued, &quot;Didn't think I'd see you two again. You'd better
clean this up or I'm calling security.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Umm,&quot; Mario started. &quot;Sorry for the mess but
things got wild here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, besides its late at night. What kids are going to be
playing here tonight?&quot; Bowser crossed his arms.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah-hem. Security!&quot; The nurse radioed.</p>
<p>&quot;Run.&quot; Mario said quietly.</p>
<p>The two took off before security arrived. Said security were
instead greeted to a room full of broken toys and anything but a fun
time.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>&quot;Toadette? What are you doing here?&quot; Peach asked.</p>
<p>Toadette had just entered the Peach's room as she reclined in a
pink beanie chair. Toadette was a special castle servant (and one of
the few girls) so had permission to visit Peach's more private
quarters. Despite being the late hour and physical exhaustion,
Peach's racing mind kept her up.</p>
<p>&quot;Buckenberry told me the news. I'm so sorry, Princess. I
would have been here sooner.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, never mind me. There's little we can do unless Mario and
Bowser pull through. I've learned to patiently-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What? Mario AND Bowser?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh dear. That hasn't been explained has it? You see, simply
put...they are working together to get to the bottom of things.&quot;
Peach tried to put on a cheerful smile.</p>
<p>&quot;Umm. Okay? Might I ask why, Princess?&quot;</p>
<p>Peach looked vacantly. &quot;I don't know. I mean, well...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do they really need to do this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh they had reasons for it but...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What princess?&quot; Toadette asked, growing more concerned,
&quot;I can tell you aren't okay with this.&quot;</p>
<p>Peach got up to look into her vanity. &quot;You're right...Ever
since their open alliance, nothing has gone right. This all started
when they became tennis partners. Now they only seem to work together
and the rest of us are never in the know. It's like, oh I don't know,
we are all being shut out now? And he's especially done this to poor
Luigi. I swear he was about to cry earlier.&quot;</p>
<p>Toadette gasped. &quot;It's all Bowser!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Peach asked, turning to her.</p>
<p>&quot;Well Princess, Bowser is doing this to have Mario all to his
self!&quot;</p>
<p>Peach's heart sunk, for a reason she didn't entirely know.
Toadette continued.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. The plan is simple. Isolate Mario from you guys so
Bowser can take him down easy!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But Toadette,&quot; Peach explained, &quot;Mario can and has
taken down Bowser single handedly. I don't think that's the plan. If
there is one...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What? Then do you think this is real? Their friendship?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's supposed to be a frenemyship actually. But either way,
I don't think he directly targeted Toad and Daisy. It would be too
obvious!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wouldn't put it past the big dumb Koopa!&quot; Toadette
said triumphantly.</p>
<p>&quot;I still say that Bowser is not THAT simple minded,&quot;
Peach said as she now stared out of her window into the night sky.
This wasn't mere optimism.</p>
<p>After all, she was the Mushroom kingdom citizen that had spent the
most time with Bowser, second to Mario of course.</p>

Frenemies Forever</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mario Party (Chapter 13)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer: I don't own Mario and co.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Author note: Unlike some other chapters, the writing
process for this was one day (the rest was proof-reading and
editing)! Sometimes my brain is rapid fire like that...We will switch

sure everyone's whereabouts are established in relation to everything
else. Expect dramatic irony.</strong></p>

<p>After the events at the hospital, Boo had finally caught up to
Luigi at his house.</p>
<p>&quot;Luigi, open up! I know you're in there!&quot; Boo knocked
again. &quot;Luigi! Please!&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi sat at the kitchen table in the dark. He couldn't help but
to glare at the happy picture of him and his brother that hung on the
wall, taken right after Super Mario 64. Mario had taken him to the
new Game Guy Palace to make up for the fact that he didn't get called
to be in the game. Luigi remember how he quickly forgot his sadness
when he had a blast, and even managed to win three thousand coins in
his first Mushroom Poker game. In the picture, he and Mario stood in
front of a huge pile of coins with huge grins on both of their faces.</p>
<p>Such happy times...but according to Mario's confession, he was
seeing Bowser even then. The thought made his blood boil. Then he
heard someone behind him.</p>
<p>&quot;Ahh!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Relax,&quot; Boo said, &quot;It's me!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How did-?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I'm guilty of 'TP' again, hehe. They should ban me from
the servers!&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi sighed. &quot;I'm not in the mood for jokes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Weegee, I know how much you care. Daisy is your girlfriend
or something right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right. I mean I knew that. I mean...so anyway, I know you
care.&quot; Boo said awkwardly.</p>
<p>&quot;Look, I appreciated it, but it's hard to get over this. I
give Mario a chance and then it goes wrong. Every time. Maybe I'm
better off alone..&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But you don't have to be alone,&quot; Boo put a hand on his
shoulder. &quot;Luigi, even if Mario isn't here for you, you have
others.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Like who?&quot; Luigi stood up. &quot;Peach is a nice
person, but too busy to really understand. Yoshi has his own
relationship to worry about! Even when Toad and Daisy were normal,
Toad was too much of a socialite to care and Daisy?...It just didn't
work out. We pair off a lot in games but in real life our
personalities conflict...a lot.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know. Listen, I don't have a ton of friends, okay?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm your friend.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know Boo, but-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And like I said before, I'll be here for you and I'll do
anything to help, even if no one else does. I don't have a ton of
friends either, most people don't even like me! But you know what?
The ones I do have are special to me, like you are...&quot;</p>
<p>Tears formed in Luigi's eyes as they were silent for a moment.</p>
<p>&quot;Did... I say something wrong?&quot; Boo asked.</p>
<p>&quot;No. *sniff* It's just that-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; he said, giving Boo a hug. Boo smiled. They
held each other for a moment.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>Lightning flashed in the red sky of Dark Land. Rain drops began to
fall, and thunder boomed in the distance.</p>
<p>After his drastic escape though a hospital window, the old Doctor
trudged through the brambles that lay off the main road leading to
Castle Koopa. He was tired and slightly injured, but the kelp on. If
he was seen by one of Bowser's sentries, the consequences would be
worse than any discomfort he received now.</p>
<p>&quot;Halt!&quot; someone called. A blinding light was shone in on
Doctor Professor Koopa, making him jump.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh it's you. Hehehehe. You're dead! Hehehe!&quot; The Dark
Boo cackled.</p>
<p>&quot;Leave the old man alone, Z,&quot; Larry scolded. &quot;Giving
the elderly heart attacks is my job. Anyway, I hear you failed!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. I-I am sorry Prince Larry, but-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Save it. I'm just out here because no one else wanted to
wait for you in the brambles and they paid me ten dollars. You can
can cry for Luddy later. Come on!&quot;</p>
<p>The Doctor followed the young prince and giggling Boo. He might as
well have been walking to his execution he thought, but maybe this is
what he deserved. He left Peach's Castle years ago for the &quot;dark
side&quot; and he was finally having to pay for it. He wished he
could be back there now. Even though he was the only Koopa in the
area, he received nothing but love and respect from the staff of the
Mushroom Castle and the King himself.</p>
<p>Unfortunately back then, the rest of the the Mushroom Kingdom's
attitude towards Koopa's weren't so great, an the pressure eventually
got to him. After much deliberation, he left Castle service while
Princess Peach was only a child. He was supposed to be moving on to
something that would appreciate his kind more, Castle Koopa service.
Of course working under the then young and handsome Kamek and Baby
Bowser was a straight downgrade. Backtracking was futile, Castle
Koopa didn't have normal working permits at the time and never &quot;laid
off&quot; anyone, at least safely. Kamek had the Doctor &quot;fired&quot;
to a Fahr Outpost prison before Bowser grew up.</p>
<p>He supposed this is why he decided to join the plot against Bowser
though the more he thought about it, his contempt was mostly for
Kamek. Either way, if he could have some revenge for his stolen life
before his game was over, he would have some closure.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>Toadsworth walked the castle hallways tall and proud. Despite his
old age, he was very much accustomed to staying up late. No use going
to bed if things are not in order, he'd always say. And since Toad's
absence, he had a few more duties to pick up on anyway. Buckenberry
called out for him as he passed his post.</p>
<p>&quot;Master Buckenberry? Greetings again! You may go to bed now.
The Princess is here and safe,&quot; Toadsworth warmly assured him.
Buckenberry huffed at this. Toadsworth continued undeterred. &quot;Master
Buckenberry, get a hold of yourself! I know all is not well, but we
must keep our hopes up!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's not that, Toadsworth. Everyone has been going on and on
about Toad! Toad this! Toad that! That cutie! I miss him!&quot;
Buckenberry said mockingly.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, yes. Our friend was in bad shape last time we checked.
Why not the adoration, young man? He is our Lead Advisor!&quot;</p>
<p>Buckenberry crossed his arms. &quot;Why not? Because Toad does not
respect princesses, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>Toadsworth jumped. &quot;How could you say such a thing?
Preposterous! Master Toad is one of our loyalist servants and he has
been a resident of this castle for very long. I suggest you think
before you accuse someone of such an dreadful thing!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; Buckenberry shot back, &quot;I suggest you look at
this!&quot;</p>
<p>He brought his phone up to Toadsworth's face, making him jerk
back. &quot;What is this?! Why are you showing me that bright glowing
cellular phone of yours?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Read it! See what Toad Toad is really about..&quot;</p>
<p>Toadsworth squinted his eyes to see the small text. It was a
Facebook post that Toad had privately posted to...Larry Koopa?</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I don't get it?&quot;</p>
<p>Buckenberry sighed. &quot;Okay, this is a pm. A private message.
He sent this to Larry other day at 2 a.m. No one was supposed to have
seen this but them, but he accidentally shared this one publicly and
then deleted it immediately. I just happened screenshot it! Now read
please.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Alright alright. You youngsters have no patience, I say! Now
it says...'hottest princesses of the year?' Master Toad says he would
put Peach miles above that annoying...oh my, what language!&quot;
Toadsworth stepped back in shock. How could such coarse opinions come
from Master Toad?</p>
<p>&quot;Now you see? Toad is..well...a jerk.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dear Eldstar,&quot; Toadsworth shook his head, &quot;It's
like those phones transform you to someone horrible.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, people do get more bold while they're on the internet,
so you kind of have a point. My point is this; Toad should resign!&quot;</p>
<p>The two stared at each other for a moment. Buckenberry continued.</p>
<p>&quot;Well?...No offense Mr. Toadsworth, but you saw the evidence.
Toad not only has 'frat boy' options of our dear Princesses, but he
converses freely with Koopalings. What if one of us conversed with a
Bowser minion? What if one of us conversed with Bowser? You know that
you would want us out of the castle, so why should Toad get a free
pass?&quot;</p>
<p>Toadsworth still looked blankly, lost in thought. &quot;Master
Buckenberry, I will...discuss this with the Princess...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, for now. This is a private matter from this point
forward. If something comes of it, you will know then. Good night,
young man.&quot;</p>
<p>Toadsworth quickly left the room. Buckenberry couldn't believe it.
Not even this shocking revelation seemed to matter. It was almost as
if...he'd have to take Toad off of his pedestal himself...</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>How could one car be so fine? There were more doohickeys than she
thought could fit in one little ol' sports car. It was almost out of
this world and she would take a picture or two if not for the fact
that Bond was driving at 100 mph down the Toad Turnpike in the dead
of night.</p>
<p>&quot;So, being a Koopa, you have a natural advantage here,&quot;
Jelectro Bond said after minutes of silence.</p>
<p>&quot;Hmm?&quot; Kylie responded, taking her eyes away from the
dazzling streetlights.</p>
<p>&quot;Your disguise will be easy. I don't think they hire many
Nokis, however.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So...we are going to work for Bowser?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ha ha,&quot; he laughed dryly, &quot;No. But we will pretend
for a moment. Sneaking in will not be an option for once.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why is that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The guy that jumped out of the window, remember?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yeah. I know the poor thing is connected somehow, but why
would that stop us from sneaking in?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He is obviously working secretly himself. There are likely
guards out specifically for secret agents of Bowser. To not be outed
by other spies, we will need to appear in a normal context. I'm
thinking...plumbers!&quot;</p>
<p>Can't argue with that, Kylie thought. &quot;So what are you
saying, Bond? We just go right up to that sucker's front door?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Exactly. We will start tomorrow, madam. I will pick you up
and we will get our disguises together. Are you fond of Koopasta?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Excuse me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know that neither of us have eaten since lunch, and the
Game Guy Club near where you live is open. Today drinks are free, by
the way. You care you join, mon ami?&quot;</p>
<p>Kylie flushed. &quot;Heh, sorry I gotta refuse. I don't drink on
the job!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then it's not a job. It's a date,&quot; he said in a low
voice.</p>
<p>&quot;O-kay...&quot; Kylie stammered. Bond smiled.</p>
<p>&quot;By the way. I read your book. Very interesting.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fungicide: The Epic Battle for the Mushroom Kingdom?! My
epic totally true story of the alien invasion that never was?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. Speed read it while I was waiting for you and Richard
earlier. So very smart to chronicle that. Time travel can be messy
after all.&quot; Bond gave her another look. Kylie's face was red
hot. In a good way!</p>
<p>&quot;Well Bond,&quot; Kylie said sheepishly, &quot;That situation
was intense, but we got through. The story HAD to be told! That's my
motto, ya know.&quot;</p>
<p>Bond laughed softly. &quot;And it's a good one, mon ami.&quot;
They turned off of an overpass to go back onto the city. Now that
there were more lights, Kylie could see the front panel of the car
better. It looked more like a spaceship! In her awe, she forgot that
she hadn't even told him where she lived!</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>&quot;And so I gotta go, baby. Good night,&quot; Yoshi said,
hanging up his phone. He sat on the castle's front porch in wait for
Mario. Finally, a taxi had pulled up. &quot;About time, Mario!&quot;
Yoshi called.</p>
<p>Mario exited the cab. &quot;Yoshi?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What went wrong? Where are they?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good news: Toad and Daisy are awake. Bad news: The MKDCU has
them.&quot;</p>
<p>Yoshi's jaw dropped. &quot;What? How?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Long story,&quot; Mario yawned, &quot;Is everyone alright?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Yoshi answered annoyed. &quot;My girlfriend is
alright too. By the way, where is yours?&quot;</p>
<p>Mario scratched his head. &quot;Peach is in the castle, right? And
Peach isn't my girlfriend...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, I mean Bowser!&quot; Yoshi huffed.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, he went back home. He was only going to visit if we got
them back.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hm,&quot; Yoshi rolled his eyes,&quot;Let's just go inside.&quot;
Mario followed him inside, confused. The moment they entered the main
hall, several Toads gathered around.</p>
<p>&quot;Hurrah for Mario!&quot; A purple capped Toad shouted. Soon
the others joined in.</p>
<p>&quot;What's going on?&quot; Mario asked Yoshi, but Yoshi was no
where to be found.</p>
<p>&quot;Is Toad okay?&quot; a yellow capped Toad asked, blocking
Mario's path.</p>
<p>&quot;Er...he's going to be. Maybe. I hope. Where is Luigi?
Peach?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Greetings Master Mario! Make way!&quot; Toadsworth announced
as he came down the stairs. &quot;Master Luigi hasn't been heard
from, but the Princess is in her private quarters. Would you like
to-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean he hasn't been heard from?&quot; Mario
interrupted.</p>
<p>&quot;Hm? Oh, I do not know. Was he supposed to arrive? Forgive my
brashness, but do you have any new info on our Castle Advisor? Oh,
and Princess Daisy of course.&quot; Toadsworth then leaned in to
whisper, &quot;And I say, Master Mario, It sure is more difficult
around here without Master Toad expediting things in his own special
way. We can talk more upstairs. Come, will you?&quot;</p>
<p>Mario nodded. He was eager to get away from his awkward welcoming
party anyway. As they walked upstairs, Toadsworth spoke again.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, Master Mario, I know you aren't technically a staff
member of our dear castle, but I don't want to worry the Princess
needlessly.&quot;</p>
<p>Mario raised one brow. &quot;Is this about the illness?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, no. Before you arrived, something was brought to my
attention by Master Buckenberry. You remember the young chap?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Blue Toad? Yeah, he's a good junior hero in our NSMB games,&quot;
Mario spoke truthfully. Buckenberry was indeed brave and ambitious,
however his opinionated personality had also caused a few conflicts
that Mario was too nice to bring up at the moment. &quot;What did he
say?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You know about that 'hip' Facebook thing, right? Well,
Master Buckenberry has some startling evidence that Toad was rather
rude online, and more worriedly, he conversed with Bower minions!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oof!&quot; Mario almost tripped up the stairs in shock.</p>
<p>&quot;Master Mario? Are you alright? Yes, I know someone like that
should be ran out of the castle but-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm okay!&quot; Mario said quickly. &quot;Uh, what do you
want me to do again?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I guess there is little to do until Master Toad is with
us again. It would not be fair to accuse a sick man of such
misconduct. I just needed to get that off of my chest, you see? I
know you are as level headed as they get!&quot; Toadsworth said with
a smile. &quot;So, about that news-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We can talk later,&quot; Mario said, brushing past him to go
to the second set of steps.</p>
<p>&quot;Master Mario? May I ask where are you going?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, to Peach's room. I need to speak to her about
something,&quot; Mario mumbled. His hands shook as he grabbed the
railings. All of the confidence he gained from being honest to his
friends earlier was gone, and he was the same nervous wreck from
before his confession. Just as he was halfway up, Toadette came out
of Peach's door.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; she said surprisingly, &quot;You're back! You look
sick too!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do I really?&quot; Mario thought out loud.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh huh! Are you alright Mario? Bowser hasn't...hurt you has
he?&quot; Toadette asked mischievously.</p>
<p>&quot;How did-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Peach told me. Just come on,&quot; Toadette reached out her
hand to him. &quot;You look like you are about to collapse any
second.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe I am,&quot; Mario said exhaustedly, grabbing her hand.
&quot;Maybe I am...&quot;</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>&quot;They need to do something about these here potholes in Toad
Town,&quot; Jimmy M. complained, &quot;They're bad for my bones!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is nothin' like them holes we had on our country
roads!&quot; Parabilly said.</p>
<p>&quot;Did I say you can talk, agent?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm hungry,&quot; Sebastian whined.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't want to hear you either,&quot; Jimmy said, &quot;All
agents that didn't follow protcol don't get to speak, you hear? You
gots to earn that again.&quot; Sebastian and Parabilly groaned.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe I followed the correct procedures, James. I would
like refreshments,&quot; Wiggletron requested. He adjusted the cool
pack on his head.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay fine. We head to the Club 64 real quick..&quot;</p>
<p>The Mushroom Kingdom Disease Control Unit were packed in a
replacement truck that wasn't a truck at all, but rather a cramped
white van. Toad and Daisy sat dazed and retrained in the very back.
Sebastian, Wiggletron, and Parabilly sat in the next row and Dick and
Jimmy in the front.</p>
<p>During the banter, Dick kept a close eye on the BooTracker from
Bond. It was flashing, indicating a received message. He just needed
a way to check it with out alerting someone. &quot;Hmm. Yeah, Club 64
sounds good,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Agent Richard? You hate them normally!&quot; Jimmy said.</p>
<p>&quot;Actually I said their portion sizes where small. But you if
grew up in Giant Land like me, everything is too small,&quot; Dick
jest. &quot;Let's just hurry up, you vermin!&quot;</p>
<p>Jimmy rolled his eyes, but complied. During this, Dick took a peek
at the message.</p>
<p>&quot;Meet us tomorrow 7.00 at post office. -J.B.&quot;</p>
<p>There was one problem. The MKDCU wasn't planning on sticking
around Toad Town, let alone the Mushroom Kingdom!</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>&quot;Lord Bowser! Welcome home!&quot; Kamek greeted from the
castle gates.</p>
<p>The taxi had just dropped off Bowser after cursing at him for a
less than sufficient tip.</p>
<p>&quot;You can quick the act, gramps,&quot; Bowser groaned. &quot;Where
is the leftovers?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In the fridge, your nastiness. By the way,&quot; Kamek
paused, &quot;How did it go?&quot; he asked sweetly. Bowser ignored
him and entered the castle. Some of the Koopalings were waiting for
him in the front room.</p>
<p>&quot;Hurrah for King Dad!&quot; Lemmy cheered. Wendy, Morton,
Iggy, and Roy joined in.</p>
<p>&quot;What is this? What are y'all doing here tonight?&quot;
Bowser asked.</p>
<p>&quot;We just appreciate all you do, King Dad!&quot; Lemmy said.
Iggy put a pink Hawaiian necklace around Bowser.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, okay? I don't remember doing anything for you brats. Is
Junior in bed?&quot;</p>
<p>Wendy pouted. &quot;Yes, he is. Anyway, King Dad, we love your
style.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't wear clothes.&quot; Bowser said matter of factly.</p>
<p>&quot;Not fashion wise, attitude wise! You do your thing and you
do it well and we love it!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. If you need a death machine built, let me know, he he!&quot;
Iggy cackled.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, and I when I beat people up, I uh...dedicate it to
you!&quot; Roy shouted out.</p>
<p>&quot;Furthermore, your contributions as an iconic villainous
character in videos games has paved the way for more lovable but
ruthless villains thought out the years. One cannot think of a more
iconic rivalry between you and the much hated and disdained Mario
Mario, Brooklynite plumber and hero of the Mushroom Kingdom-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Alright already!&quot; the rest of the Koopalings shouted at
Morton.</p>
<p>&quot;This is crazy. I'm leaving!&quot; Bowser marched past them
to his inner chambers. Ludwig came around a corner to intercept him.
He was wearing a black overcoat and held on to some hot tea.</p>
<p>&quot;King Dad,&quot; he greeted genially, &quot;Welcome back.
What is wrong?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ludwig...Well you seem comfortable at least. What's with
them back there?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Being imbeciles as usual,&quot; Ludwig yawned. &quot;Did
your excursion go well?&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser figured he could drop the charade. Besides, unlike Mario,
he was in the position of power and had nothing to lose. His approval
ratings were in negative numbers anyway, he paid employees little,
and thank goodness Dark Land had no OSHA compliance! His underlings
would have to accept it, or else! &quot;If you haven't heard, Toad
and that Daisy chick went out cold earlier today.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes father. That is why the tennis match was canceled,
right? Shame. You and Mario were clearly going to win.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Heh. Well yeah. So anyway I decided to help them figure out
what's going on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Them? Who?&quot; Ludwig asked with a smirk.</p>
<p>&quot;...Mario. But it ain't what you think!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is it?&quot; Ludwig asked, sharply. &quot;Is it, father?! Do
you think you can rule the Kingdom with your BFF, Mario?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hey!&quot; Bowser shouted, &quot;What are you saying?!&quot;</p>
<p>Ludwig calmed down and laughed slightly, to Bowser's confusion.</p>
<p>&quot;I am saying this, father. I do not know how Mario and
friends are receiving you now, but they will not want you back in
that despicable Toad Town soon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And why not?&quot; Bowser got in his face. Ludwig
instinctively leaned back, but continued.</p>
<p>&quot;Because, who would want to associate with someone who gave
their friends Mushroom Flu!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mushroom Flu?! How?&quot; Bowser grabbed Ludwig by his
collar, &quot;And what makes you think I'm going to let you get away
with this?&quot; he roared. The tea hit the ground, shattering the
ceramic cup. Ludwig panicked for split second, regaining his
composure only enough to snap his fingers. Suddenly a jolt went
through Bowser's spine. He dropped Ludwig instantly as the shock went
from head to toe, originating from the Hawaiian neckless! In a matter
of seconds, Bowser hit the ground. He was out cold.</p>
<p>&quot;It worked!&quot; Iggy said, stepping through the door. &quot;Ha
ha ha! Wonder if Larry's still watching the old doc?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Iggy,&quot; Ludwig said, still breathing heavily, &quot;Get
Roy and Morton to move King Dad to the dungeon. We have a lot to do
tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Geez, okay Luddy. Lighten up! My patented shock Hawaiian
necklace worked like a charm after all!&quot;</p>
<p>Ludwig groaned something in German as he felt where buttons were
now missing on his expensive jacket. &quot;I meant to ask, why
Hawaiian? What did I tell you about your Real World obsessions? First
it was anime, now this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh just let me have my fun, Luddy. Soon enough, we'll have
the old King Dad back, like gramps said we would!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I hope so,&quot; Ludwig said as he glanced towards the
fallen Bowser with an unreadable expression.</p>

<p>&quot;This Golden Oldies, Toad Town's best radio station! That was
'I love Koopatrol' by Joan T. And the Black Shy Guys!&quot; The radio
host said, &quot;Now get ready for the Mature Gamers Contemporary
Silent Storm!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Aww, man! Now they're only going to play crappy old people
music!&quot; Emery T. complained. &quot;Please, play more Atari and
iiiii!&quot;</p>
<p>The doors leading to the roof of Mushroom Kingdom East hospital
swung open. Emery quickly shut off the radio, put away her phone,
dusted the crumbs off of her uniform, hid the candy rappers, spit out
her chewing gum, sat up in her chair, and appeared to be doing her
job. The nurse shook her head.</p>
<p>&quot;Emery, you can go home now. And don't have the radio up so
loud next time.&quot; Nass T. spoke cordially.</p>
<p>Emery fidgeted with her beacons, &quot;So...I'm not in trouble?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No dear, why would you be?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, never mind. So is Mario and the rest alright? I saw this
whole place kind of evacuate earlier.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He is fine. The health department took away his friends
though,&quot; Nass said, looking down from the roof top.</p>
<p>&quot;Umm, okay? Why did their truck get towed?&quot; Emery asked.
Nass T. turned around quickly. She had forgot that her daughter could
see everything from her vantage point.</p>
<p>&quot;Who knows why? It's ten o'clock, go home dear.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, mom. Can I at least stop at Club 64 first?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure. Take the car, I'm going to have to stay overnight
again.&quot; Nass handed over her car keys.</p>
<p>Emery pretended to pout disappointedly. This was actually perfect
for her. With no curfew, she had lots of reasons to look forward to
Club 64. &quot;Bye, mom. Love you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Love you too, dear,&quot; Nass T. said, continuing to look
at the town form the rooftop.</p>
<p><strong>To be continued...</strong></p>

<p><strong>Author note: Hope this was easy to follow. I really wanted
to include everyone and their whereabouts and situations in this.
Like I said before, the mystery aspect is over kind of. (Unless I
missed a plot point somewhere. PM me if I have or something else
doesn't make sense) Stay tuned.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Retrospectives:</strong></p>
<p><strong>-Other people being sick with the &quot;Tennis Virus&quot;
is NOT a forgotten plot point like it seems. It's just that only Toad
and Daisy are so severe and they get the most attention as the first
ones to get sick. Other people getting sick will come up more as
Bowser's slander plot goes full swing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>-&quot;I love Koopatrol&quot; is a pun of &quot;I love
rock and roll&quot;. &quot;Atari and iiii&quot; is a pun of the
group, &quot;Azari and iii&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>-Mario and Bowser's experiences are supposed to parallel.</strong></p>
