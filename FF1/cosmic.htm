<p>Under a sunny blue sky, Mario and friends were enjoying a
wonderful picnic. In the grassy field lay a large red Mario emblem
blanket, and seated on it was Mario, Peach, and Luigi. Little did
they know, someone was watching from the nearby bushes.</p>
<p>&quot;This is such a beautiful day! Teehee!&quot; Peach giggled,
leaning close to Mario. Mario looked her way warmly then opened the
picnic basket. Inside was bread for sandwiches, ham, pasta,
mushrooms, pizza, candy, Peach's cake, Shroom shakes, FungusUp,
napkins, more mushrooms, a monkey wrench, a Fidget spinner, a
Nintendo DS, a thousand coins, and finally, some mustard.</p>
<p>&quot;Ooh, I think I'm feeling adventurous. I'm going to invent a
new kind of sandwich!&quot; Peach said excitingly after peering into
the basket. She grabbed the bread as the Mario brothers looked on,
wondering what she'd might pick. She pulled out the fidget spinner,
Nintendo DS, and ham. &quot;Won't this make the most delicious
sandwich?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wait, Princess!&quot; Mario called out. &quot;Uh, well...&quot;</p>
<p>Crunch! Peach's beautiful and expensively taken care of teeth had
no issues biting through the hard ingredients.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm gonna miss my fidget spinner...&quot; Luigi sighed.</p>
<p>Mario had a laugh. &quot;Guess we shouldn't have packed all of
this other stuff in the basket with the food-&quot;</p>
<p>Pow! The basket exploded as if someone had shot a Bullet Bill at
it and it caught on fire. Peach dropped her sandwich in shock as the
Mario brothers jumped up.</p>
<p>&quot;Enemy attack!&quot; Mario shouted.</p>
<p>Luigi ran up to Peach and held her tight. &quot;Princess secured!&quot;</p>
<p>Mario shot him a look. &quot;Hey, hands off, okay?&quot; Luigi let
go defeatedly. Just then another shot went off, narrowly missing
Mario.</p>
<p>&quot;Darn it! Why did I bring a two barrel canon?!&quot; the
bushes screamed, with a few extra profanities thrown in.</p>
<p>&quot;It's coming from that bush, bro!&quot; Luigi pointed out.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh dear! I hate when talking bushes attack!&quot; Peach
shrieked.</p>
<p>&quot;Paperize!&quot; Mario yelled. The world froze in place and
then went flat. Kirsti came out of nowhere and lifted Mario above the
flattened world. Immediately the bushes lifted up slightly,
indicating that they could be removed. Mario did so and the bush
paper item appeared in his inventory. He exited the paperize world
and waved goodbye to Kirsti, who rolled her eyes before returning to
the Sticker Star galaxy.</p>
<p>Behind the bush was Cosmic Mario! Everyone gawked at the starry
blue galactic impostor. Cosmic Mario threw the cannon down in a rage.</p>
<p>&quot;So you found me,&quot; he spat in a gravely voice, &quot;Race
me then, you son of-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nah,&quot; Mario said offhandedly. &quot;Were trying to have
a picnic, you know?&quot;</p>
<p>A 'You lose!' Message popped up because Mario refused the race, so
he immediately killed over.</p>
<p>&quot;Mario!&quot; Peach called out.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh that's supposed to happen,&quot; Luigi said, &quot;but
it's okay because- Super Luigi to the rescue!-&quot;</p>
<p>Bam! Cosmic Mario effortlessly tackled him to the ground and
walloped him. After five seconds, Luigi was out, cold.</p>
<p>&quot;Ha ha! You lose, loser!&quot; Cosmic Mario mocked. &quot;I
beat the Mario brothers!&quot; Cosmic Mario stood up victoriously.</p>
<p>&quot;Please! Don't hurt me!&quot; Peach plead, backing away.</p>
<p>Cosmic Mario looked at her. &quot;What ever, babe. I'm not into
women like that,&quot; he scoffed.</p>
<p>Peach froze. &quot;Wait, so you're-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;-Into revenge. Yes, uh huh!&quot; Cosmic Mario nodded. &quot;Nice
sandwich you made, by the way. I'll have to try it sometime. Well,
I'll see you around. Bwa ha ha-&quot; Cosmic Mario's evil laugh was
cut off by a coughing fit. &quot;...Sorry, those bushes started up my
allergies. Ha!&quot;</p>
<p>He ran off, leaving Peach and the unconscious Mario brothers
alone.</p>
<p>After a while, the Mario brothers woke up, confused.</p>
<p>&quot;Momma Mia! What was that about? What a jerk! And where's the
food?&quot; Mario asked, looking at the charred remains of what was
their picnic basket.</p>
<p>Peach burped. &quot;Oh teehee! I got...hungry?&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi got up, holding his aching head, and sighed, &quot;I'm still
gonna miss that fidget spinner...&quot;</p>

<p>Wario and Waluigi sat in a dark tinted black sports car parked in
front of the Mushroom Regional Bank. They both wore black clothes and
masks to hide their identity.</p>
<p>Waluigi stared at the weathered piece of paper with shaky hands.
&quot;So, uh, I just give them this note and run?&quot;</p>
<p>Wario whacked Waluigi. &quot;You idiot! Take the money before you
run!&quot;</p>
<p>Waluigi gave Wario a nasty look while rubbing the back of his
head. &quot;Okay, wise guy, do I give them the note before or after I
take the money?&quot;</p>
<p>Wario sighed. &quot;You know what? You drive the getaway car and
I'll steal the cash. Okay?!&quot;</p>
<p>Waluigi banged on the dashboard in anger. &quot;Wah! I always have
to do that! When will you trust me?!&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile Cosmic Mario was walking down the sidewalk fully
engrossed in his phone. He was currently trolling people on Mario's
Facebook page by posting Playstation ads. As he walked up something
caught his attention. Right beside him was the nicest car he'd ever
seen. A sleek shiny two door Aston Mushroom parked right in front of
the bank. It was even his favorite color, black! Cosmic Mario walked
up close to check it out it's big fancy spinning wheels, unaware of
the passengers inside.</p>
<p>The drivers door swung open. &quot;I'm stealing the money, it's
final!&quot; Wario screamed as he got out. He noticed Cosmic Mario.
&quot;Hey, don't put any scratches in my new car, weirdo!&quot;</p>
<p>Cosmic Mario smirked. &quot;I'm just admiring this beauty. How
much coinage it goes for?&quot;</p>
<p>Wario closed the door and continued to look suspiciously. &quot;About
half a million coins. Why?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wow, Wario, you're making bank!&quot; Cosmic Mario remarked.</p>
<p>Wario laughed proudly. &quot;Well of course I am&hellip;.wait, how
did you know who I was?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because I've seen your fat butt all over town before. Say,
you wasn't trying to disguise yourself or anything, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe I was! So don't you say anything while I rob this-&quot;
Wario covered his mouth with his hands.</p>
<p>Cosmic Mario laughed wildly. &quot;You really are a professional,
aren't you!&quot;</p>
<p>Wario approached him and shook his fist. &quot;Knock it off,
loser. You really wanna mess with me?&quot;</p>
<p>Cosmic Mario casually crossed his arms. &quot;No I want to help. I
could use a mill or two. Let's do it.&quot;</p>
<p>Wario stepped back. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Heh. Well, someone has to distract the on duty officer. You
DID know he was in there, right?&quot;</p>
<p>Wario looked around nervously. &quot;Uh, sure. We knew that!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So what will it be? You willing to split it?&quot; Cosmic
Mario held out his hand.</p>
<p>Wario thought for a moment. &quot;Ten percent.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Forty.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Five percent.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're going the wrong way, fatso!&quot;</p>
<p>Wario huffed. &quot;Thirty.&quot;</p>
<p>Cosmic Mario shook his hand, squeezing extra tight.</p>
<p>Wario held on to his hand. &quot;Ow! You got an arm on you, pal.
So now what? You distract him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah. But uh, give me that note.&quot;</p>
<p>Wario raised one eyebrow. &quot;Oh, you mean this?&quot; He pulled
the wrinkled paper from his pockets.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, thanks.&quot; Cosmic Mario took it, holding it with
only the tips of his fingers because the paper was so dirty he didn't
want to catch anything from it. &quot;Alright, then. Sit tight until
the signal. Don't move until you hear it, no matter what! Got it?&quot;</p>
<p>Wario nodded, not entirely happy with Cosmic Mario taking over all
of the sudden. Soon Cosmic Mario disappeared into the bank. Wario got
tired of standing and got back into the car. Waluigi had already
gotten into the drivers seat for the getaway, so Wario ended up
plopping down in his lap.</p>
<p>&quot;Oof! You have the cash already?!&quot; Waluigi said,
struggling to breathe.</p>
<p>&quot;No, I'm waiting on our new accomplice.&quot;</p>
<p>Waluigi made mumbling noises.</p>
<p>&quot;No, not that Bandit guy again. It was this blue looking guy
with no face or discernible features and I'm waiting for his signal.&quot;</p>
<p>More mumbling noises.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, no. He didn't tell me his name...or what the signal was.
Why? I don't see you making business deals around here!&quot;</p>
<p>Just then Cosmic Mario rushed to the car holding several bags of
money. Wario immediately opened the door.</p>
<p>&quot;Quick get out! I need to fit all of this money in here!&quot;
Cosmic Mario told them.</p>
<p>Wario jumped out and dragged Waluigi with him. &quot;Fine, hurry
up! And what happened to that signal? None of this was our plan!?&quot;</p>
<p>Cosmic Mario tossed the bags in the back seat and then jumped in,
locking the door behind him. Wario banged on the window as the car
cranked up.</p>
<p>&quot;What's going on?&quot; Waluigi asked, picking himself off of
the ground.</p>
<p>&quot;WE'RE BEING ROBBED!&quot;</p>
<p>The window lowered slowly. Cosmic Mario was wearing Wario's
designer sun glasses that he'd left on the dashboard.</p>
<p>&quot;Here's your signal, buddy.&quot; He put his thumb to his
nose in a rude gesture and sped off.</p>
<p>&quot;NOOOOO!&quot; Wario screamed as two cop cars pulled up.</p>
<p>&quot;We have the suspects right here. Like the description said,
he's dark, and he even has a friend!&quot; One cop said to another.</p>
<p>The other cop snickered. &quot;Yep. Has to be the right guy, but
no one mentioned how FAT he was!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well screw me!&quot; Wario said in defeat. He raised his
hands in surrender.</p>
<p>Waluigi looked to him. &quot;As long as you don't sit on me in
prison...&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Author note: Not everyone Cosmic Mario is douche to has to
be innocent. He can screw over bad guys as well. Peace!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Spooky Speedster's Quest for &quot;it&quot;</strong></p>
<p><strong>By: C. Mechayoshi</strong></p>
<p><strong>Created: 5/27/17</strong></p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer: Mario and co. Belong to Nintendo.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary: The Spooky Speedster, always on the quest for
&quot;it&quot; and never gotten over losing &quot;it&quot; from
Mario. But he's 'never never gonna get it'!</strong></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p><em>Fun fact from present day me: I had Spooky Speedster added to the character list on FF.net for this story</em></p>

<p>Next door to Luigi's Mansion was the Boo Mansion, a community home
for Boos all around. They hosted Boo parties, Boo circles, Boo
hauntings, the works. It was also home to Mario's dreaded, most
superior, most speediest, most feared enemy, the Spooky
Speedster...According to himself at least.</p>
<p>&quot;Correct, Mario has busted his pants exactly five times!
Congratulations Mr. McGoomba. You win the grand prize!&quot; Chuck
Quizmo announced excitedly. The camera cut to a view of the audience,
who went wild. &quot;Take your star!&quot;</p>
<p>The Spooky Speedster threw the remote angry at the results of the
televised program. He narrowly missed another Boo that was watching
tv as well.</p>
<p>&quot;Gosh, you suck, Speedy!&quot; Boo said.</p>
<p>&quot;But why does he deserve 'it', and not me?!&quot; the helmet
wearing Boo whined.</p>
<p>&quot;What? The star?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yesss! I live for 'it', but I can never have it!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe you never get it because you're pathetic?&quot; Boo
teased.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't give me that. You've had a star before in the Mario
Parties, you've gotten to experience it,&quot; Speedy grumbled.</p>
<p>&quot;It just makes you invincible for a few seconds. What's the
big deal?&quot; Boo asked, not really following.</p>
<p>Speedy huffed. &quot;Whatever, I'm going to take it out on Luigi
next door by, I don't know, terrorizing him in his sleep or
something. See Ya!&quot; Speedy clicked down his visor and sped (no
pun intended) away.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh no!&quot; Boo panicked. Boo pulled out a phone and dialed
a number.</p>
<p>Next door, Luigi was setting around at his table, tinkering with a
new intention Pro E. Gadd had given him to test out. Supposedly, this
device could let you see Boos even if they were invisible. Since such
a device would be invaluable for him and Mario, Luigi jumped at the
opportunity to test it. If only he could cut the thing on...</p>
<p>Ring ring! Luigi picked up his phone nearby. &quot;Hello?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Luigi! You're in danger, the Spooky Speedster is gonna get
you!&quot; Boo screamed very quickly.</p>
<p>Luigi took the phone away from his ear. &quot;OW!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Opps, sorry,&quot; Boo apologized, &quot;His star impotence
is making his loony! You gotta watch your back!&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi stifled a laugh. &quot;Star impotence? Okay? Well, I do have
this invention that should let me see invisible Boos. You should
check it out!&quot; Boo was Luigi's only friend in the area, and
maybe Boo could help him figure out the invention.</p>
<p>&quot;Really?!&quot; Boo exclaimed.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah. I'll shut off my maximum security high voltage
electrified anti-boo barriers to let you in. Come on down!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure thing!&quot; Boo snuck out of the mansion without
attracting anyone's notice. A moment later, Boo was right outside of
Luigi's house. Guarding it was a tall gothic iron fence, electrified
by a generator Luigi kelp to keep his Boo neighbors out. It opened
slightly and Boo squeezed in.</p>
<p>&quot;Dang it!&quot; The Spooky Speedster, who had been creepily
peeping at Luigi's house from across the street growled. &quot;I
missed my chance. I'm getting in there!&quot;</p>
<p>Speedy took a run for it right as the gates shut and the electric
barrier came back. Speedy took a leap over the tall fence, but
brushed on top of it.</p>
<p>ZAP!</p>
<p>A million volts went through Speedy, feeling hotter and more
painful than the time he tried to race a Daredevil comet around the
sun. His charred body flopped into Luigi's well cared for lawn, but
at least he was in.</p>
<p><strong>Meanwhile back at the Boo Mansion...</strong></p>
<p>An apron wearing King Boo busted out of the kitchen with a pan
full of cookies. They were vaguely human shaped with chocolate chips
were eyes would go.</p>
<p>&quot;Who wants some?&quot;</p>
<p>Big Boo, whose rear took up the entire couch started. &quot;Oh
boy! I love cookies!&quot; He stuck out his massive tongue for the
whole tray.</p>
<p>King Boo held them away. &quot;Anyone else I mean? You said you
were on a diet, remember? Where is Speedy? He had first dibs on them
I think.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know, hon,&quot; a Red Boo said. &quot;Oh, look at
the time. I have go to a Mario Party and steal someone's star because
they landed on my orb or something.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; King Boo questioned.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know, hon. Mario Party has gotten weird lately. If I
see Speedy outside I'll call. He likes to creep on Luigi, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>King Boo's eyes lit up, making the deep pink colored Boo curse
herself. She'd forgotten King Boo was crazy about Luigi as well. She
was now regretting having to leave the mansion with such lunatics
living there, but she had a job at Mario Party ever since that Boo
that was in the N64 games quit. She reluctantly left the mansion.</p>
<p>King Boo put the pan down. &quot;Knock yourself out,&quot; he told
the nearby Boos. &quot;I suddenly have the urge to terrorize Luigi in
his sleep or something! Bwa ha ha ha ha ha ha!&quot;</p>

<p>Luigi and Boo were in the den of Luigi's Mansion, setting on a
green carpeted rug. The fireplace before them glowed in the dim room.
The clouds outside made it dark even though it was only evening.</p>
<p>Boo observed the Pro E. Gadd's contraption closely. The
&quot;Visualizer 5000&quot; was a pair of goggles with a ton of
multicolored wires sticking out.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you think?&quot; Luigi asked.</p>
<p>Boo held it. &quot;Well it looks like a lot of fun, I can tell you
that!&quot; Boo put the goggles on. &quot;Whoa!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; Luigi asked.</p>
<p>Boo looked around the room. &quot;Everything looks completely
normal.&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi leaned in. &quot;Really?&quot;</p>
<p>Boo turned to him. &quot;Wow! You look normal too!&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi pouted. &quot;Well, I'm not a Boo so I guess that was
useless. Shouldn't I try it out on you?&quot;</p>
<p>Boo took the goggles off and handed them to Luigi. &quot;Yeah,
guess so. Okay, do you see me?&quot; Boo turned invisible.</p>
<p>Luigi put the goggles on and looked around. &quot;Boo? Everything
looks the same, minus you. Where are you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right here, hehe!&quot; Boo said from behind Luigi's back,
making him jump.</p>
<p>&quot;Yikes! Okay, clearly this doesn't just work automatically.
Hmm...&quot; Luigi looked closely at the inside of the ear strap.
&quot;Wait a minute, 'batteries not included'?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you have batteries?&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi pondered for a moment. &quot;Not really.. You'd think
Professor would have mentioned that.&quot;</p>
<p>Boo wagged his finger (use your imagination). &quot;Well, don't
you worry Weegee. I got a trick for that!&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi raised one eyebrow. &quot;Tell me..&quot;</p>
<p>Boo gave him a sly look. &quot;You have a generator for that
million volt fence of yours, right?&quot;</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>The Spooky Speedster was unconscious for five minutes. &quot;Ugh.
What's cooking? Oh wait, me?! Oww!&quot;</p>
<p>Speedy looked around Luigi's yard. His grass was lush and green,
as opposed to the brown muddy yard of the Boo Mansion. Daisies were
planted on the side of the brick path leading to the entrance of his
green and white abode. In the yard was also an emerald green statue
of Luigi doing a jumping pose. Speedy got closer.</p>
<p>The sign in front of it read: My gift to my hero, Luigi. Love,
Daisy.</p>
<p>&quot;Uhg! Green freak even has a girlfriend! Bet I would too if I
had a star!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pssst!&quot;</p>
<p>Speedy turned around, and King Boo was staring at him from the
other side of the fence.</p>
<p>&quot;How did you get in there? Answer now!&quot; King Boo
commanded.</p>
<p>Speedy stuck his tongue out. &quot;My skills, fatty!&quot;</p>
<p>King Boo growled in anger. &quot;Let me in!&quot;</p>
<p>Speedy shook his head. &quot;Nope! I'm gonna get Luigi, AND his
star!&quot; Speedy retreated to the back of Luigi's yard as rain
started to fall.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm glad Big Boo got your cookies!&quot; King Boo screamed.
He went back to the Boo Mansion with another plan in mind.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Boo and Luigi we're in the also dimly lit basement
where power generators were. Boo held a a jumper cable in one hand
and the Visualiser 5000 in the other. Luigi's eyes darted from his
expensive generator to the gadget to Boo and back. &quot;Boo, isn't
this TOO much power?&quot;</p>
<p>Boo shook his head as he attached one end of the cable to the
goggles. &quot;Nah. Anything Professor makes is indestructible, you
should know that! Now how do I plug the other side in?&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi reluctantly flipped open a cover on the generator, revealing
two metal prongs that stuck up. &quot;Try here. Guess I should be
wearing the Visualiser too. We can't tell if they're working
otherwise!&quot;</p>
<p>After giving Boo the thumbs up, Boo attached the cable to the
generator side and Luigi put the goggles on. Instantly, the goggles
started to spark while on his face.</p>
<p>&quot;What's happening!?&quot; Luigi asked.</p>
<p>Boo stepped back. &quot;Uh-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wait! Turn invisible!&quot; Luigi said excitingly.</p>
<p>Boo obeyed as more sparks flew. &quot;Okay?&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi pointed to the spot he stood. &quot;Did you do it? I still
see you so it works!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yay!&quot; Boo cheered.</p>
<p><em>Click</em>! Pop. <strong>BANG</strong>!</p>
<p>Capacitors popped and transistors blew before a thud from the
generator resulted in the power cutting off in the whole mansion.
Luigi and Boo were now in the dark.</p>
<p>&quot;Nooo!&quot; Boo cried.</p>
<p>Luigi took off the goggles in a panic and ran out of the basement,
leaving Boo behind. When Boo caught up to him, he was in the kitchen,
peeping through his window on the side facing Boo Mansion next door.
Through the stormy weather, Luigi's eyes were glued to Boo Mansion.</p>
<p>Boo approached slowly. &quot;Weegee?&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi looked back at Boo, pale in the face. &quot;Do you know what
this means? No power, no defense! <em>Any of my deadly neighbors
could just walk in here now</em>!&quot;</p>

<p>The gigantic Big Boo, shifty Dark Boo, and oddball Stretch lined
up in the front yard of the Boo Mansion as the rain became a good
pour. This didn't stop their liege ruler, King Boo from persisting in
his billboard creating.</p>
<p>King Boo groaned loudly as the marker slipped from his hand to the
muddy ground which was already muddy before the rain, so it was
muddier than muddy now.</p>
<p>&quot;Ugh, I give up! We have enough signs now. Show me what you
got!&quot;</p>
<p>Big Boo held up one that said, &quot;Big boos ned big space&quot;.There
was also a bite taken out of the sign for some reason.</p>
<p>King Boo glanced over it like he was a critic, even rubbing his
chin and examining the penmanship. &quot;Hmm. Typos, chicken scratch
writing, a bite taken out of it? Perfect, but if you eat a sign again
it's no more cookies for you. Next!&quot;</p>
<p>Dark Boo proudly showed his. It said, &quot;dark, not evil&quot;.</p>
<p>King Boo only gave it a quick cursory glance. &quot;A bit safe.
I'll let it go. Next!&quot;</p>
<p>Stretch displayed his from his teeth, because he was shaped like a
block and had no arms. It read, &quot;Big (scratched out and replaced
with 'long') boos need big space.&quot;</p>
<p>King Boo smiled widely. &quot;Now THIS is a sign. That green idiot
will have to open his gates once he sees our-&quot;</p>
<p>One of Stretch's heads glanced over. &quot;Hey look, the power is
out at Luigi's house.&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi's mansion stood next door in its &quot;best looking house on
the block&quot; splendor, but it was completely dark inside, and the
red lights that were usually lit on his security fence were dead.</p>
<p>King Boo blinked a few times. &quot;Uh, I knew that! That was the
plan all along, I just wanted to test everyone's activism first just
in case we ever want to protest.. something.&quot; King Boo Paused
suddenly. &quot;I know Speedy is already over Luigi's and Red Boo
bounced, but where is Boo Diddley?&quot;</p>
<p>Big Boo, who had taken another bite out of his sign, raised his
hand. &quot;Ooh I know! Probably with his bf Weegee!&quot;</p>
<p>King Boo groaned in response. Stretch raised their hand. &quot;Umm,
we're gonna recycle these signs, right?&quot;</p>
<p>King Boo glared next door again. &quot;No, just throw them on the
ground, our yard is awful anyway. We however can recycle Luigi's face
when we march straight over, heh heh!&quot;</p>
<p>Dark Boo bounced around giddy. &quot;So does that mean we're
having a boo party?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;NO! I mean yes.. the kind where Luigi dies!</p>
<p>&quot;Just my kind of party!&quot; Dark Boo cackled.</p>
<p>King Boo's face twisted in malice. &quot;After that, we'll drag
Speedy's spotlight stealing and Boo's traitorous self back where they
belong!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Meanwhile at Luigi's Mansion</strong></p>
<p>In a montage of sorts Luigi dove into his closet and grabbed some
gear. First he put on a green heavy helmet with a visor, then he
snapped on a utility belt. He then jumped out of his usual brown
plumber boots to black steel toed combat boots. Lastly, Luigi threw
on a black leather jacket. He walked out of his room to Boo who
gawked at his sudden appearance.</p>
<p>&quot;Luigi?!&quot; Boo blushed slightly.</p>
<p>&quot;That's right! No Boo is gonna terrify me tonight!&quot;
Luigi pounded his fist to his chest, but a little too hard, for he
almost knocked the wind out of himself.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay Weegee, but how is that gonna stop one of us?&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi walked to the kitchen. &quot;Oh this? It's just to look
cool. Poltergust 90001/2, activate!&quot;</p>
<p>Just then Luigi's Microwave lit up. &quot;Activated. Awaiting
command,&quot; it spoke.</p>
<p>&quot;Your microwave talks?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's a battery operated security system,&quot; Luigi said,
pushing a few buttons on the contraption, &quot;So like, it can't
stop anyone from getting in the yard like the fence, and it won't
really attack or anything, but it will alert us of any sneaky
shenanigans.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay but, so if they do get in, then what?&quot; Boo asked
worriedly.</p>
<p>&quot;Well...I'm not sure. My Poltergust 5000, you know, the one
that actually can attack boos is kind of in the repair shop!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; Boo gasped.</p>
<p>Luigi scratched the back of his neck. &quot;Er, yeah. I kind of
broke it while using it as a normal vacuum. What could I say? This
mansion needed a clean up!&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, The Spooky Speedster was snooping around in Luigi's
back yard. He spotted a pitchfork leaning against the house. After
waving the agricultural tool around for a bit he sat it back down.</p>
<p>&quot;No no, that won't terrorize Luigi. Hmm..&quot; Speedy looked
around Luigi's back yard. It didn't have much going on like the front
yard, but the lawn was still green and pretty. &quot;Ah ha!&quot;
Speedy picked up a garden gnome. &quot;This would scare anyone!&quot;</p>
<p>Speedy went straight to one of Luigi's windows and looked inside.
&quot;What the?! Why is it so dark? Is he and Boo Diddley&hellip;.?
Oh no!&quot; Speedy blushed at the implications. Just then he hear
someone coming near and went invisible.</p>
<p>&quot;Now let's do this proper,&quot; King Boo said as he and the
other boos floated to the back. &quot;We'll all gather in the
basement, because that's where all scary things come from of course,
then we emerge and beat him senseless. No need for sneaky stuff, he's
probably on edge already. I just want him dead, okay?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you think you're doing!?&quot; Speedy yelled. If
Luigi was dead, he'd never steal his star!</p>
<p>&quot;D-did that floating garden gnome just talk?!&quot; Stretch
said.</p>
<p>Speedy revealed himself. &quot;No! You are NOT killing Luigi, at
least not until I get one star!&quot;</p>
<p>King Boo was unimpressed. &quot;So anyway, let's do this!&quot;</p>
<p>Speedy stuck his tongue out again. &quot;How ya gonna get in
here?&quot;</p>
<p>King Boo phased through the fence, unharmed. &quot;Like this. Get
him!&quot;</p>
<p>Big Boo, Dark Boo, and Stretch immediately went after Speedy. Even
his sprinting skills couldn't help against such a sudden attack.
Stretch restrained him and he couldn't wiggle free from the grasp of
the oddball boo, who had the strength of two boos.</p>
<p>King Boo smiled maliciously. &quot;You stay put while we take care
of Luigi. Then, when we're done, you and Boo Diddley who's with that
green loser will get your punishment. Come on!&quot;</p>
<p>King Boo, Dark Boo, and Big Boo entered his mansion using their
incorporeal abilities to go through the wall. Speedy cursed to
himself. Now he'd never get his star!</p>

<p>Boo put a bag of buttery microwave popcorn into the Poltergust
9000 &frac12;. As Boo pressed the digits for two minutes, Luigi
stumbled into the kitchen, almost tripping over his own feet.</p>
<p>&quot;Boo, don't!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;TRACKER ACTIVATED. NOW SCANNING HOUSE.&quot; A red light
shot from the machine and slowly trek from the ceiling to the floor.
&quot;SCAN COMPLETE. BOOS DETECTED.&quot;</p>
<p>Boo took a few steps back petrified. &quot;B-boos?&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi tried pressing a few buttons to pacify the machine but it
kelp beeping no matter what he pressed. &quot;I don't know what's
wrong with this. I'm sure it's glitching out again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right, cause&hellip;&quot; Boo glanced out of the kitchen
window, which faced the Boo Mansion. &quot;I'm the only boo here...I
hope&hellip;&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Meanwhile...</strong></p>
<p>King Boo took a good look around Luigi's basement. Using his
excellent night vision, he could see that Luigi stored his laundry,
dry food containers, sports equipment, a portrait of himself, another
small sculpture of himself, a bookshelf filled with his own novels,
powerups hung on hangers, and lastly, the dead power generator.</p>
<p>Dark Boo wandered near the clothes rack and was eyeing Luigi's
Kitsune outfit. &quot;Oooh, what is this furry thing? So cute!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hehehe. This tastes good!&quot; Big Boo was munching on one
of Luigi's &quot;Super Luigi Adventure&quot; novels.</p>
<p>King Boo pulled them away from the miscellaneous items by the ear.
(Use your imagination.) &quot;I command both of you to focus! We can
wreck Luigi's home AFTER we wreck him. Come on, here's the stairs out
of here.&quot;</p>
<p>Creak! The door became ajar and a sliver of dim candle light
leaked into the basement.</p>
<p>King Boo and the rest froze as Boo Diddley walked down the steps
while holding a burnt bag of popcorn.</p>
<p>Boo suddenly stopped halfway down. &quot;What a minute&hellip;.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;GET HIM!&quot; King Boo screamed.</p>
<p>Dark Boo and Big Boo charged ahead but since they tried to go up
the narrow stairway at the same time, they got stuck, allowing Boo to
dash back out and shut the door tightly.</p>
<p>&quot;Idiots!&quot; King Boo snapped.</p>
<p>&quot;Get off of me!&quot; Dark Boo screeched.</p>
<p>&quot;No you get off of me!&quot; Big Boo then belched loudly.
King Boo shoved them both forward, resulting in a hard faceplant on
the steps.</p>
<p>&quot;Now why would you do that while solid?&quot; King Boo shook
his head. &quot;I chose the WORSE accomplices. Boo is probably
warning Luigi as we speak.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry king!&quot; Dark and Big Boo said in unison.</p>
<p>An evil gleam appeared in King Boo's eyes. &quot;You will be
sorry, alright. But for now, I command you to stay down here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No buts! I'm going to destroy Luigi and you two will only
get in my way. Let me show you how to&hellip;&quot; The camera
dramatically zoomed in on his face. &quot;...<em>Do a real
haunting</em>&hellip;.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Outside</strong>.</p>
<p>Rain poured and the wind blew harshly as The Spooky Speedster was
still being restrained by Stretch the conjoined boo.</p>
<p>&quot;Please, let me go!&quot; Speedy cried.</p>
<p>&quot;No I can't. I don't want to get punished,&quot; Stretch
replied.</p>
<p>&quot;But I have to have that star...I'm nothing without it!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's all you want?&quot; Stretch's second head asked
mockingly.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. Don't you know what a star does to you? I use to know.
I use to know before <em>he </em>took it from me&hellip;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, so Luigi took your star?&quot; the first head asked.</p>
<p>&quot;No, Mario, but Luigi is guilty by association.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well King Boo is going to kill him anyway.&quot;</p>
<p>Speedy turned red in the face. &quot;And that's a problem! I don't
want him dead, I want his star! If you let me go, I'll give you a
star as well. I know he has tons!&quot;</p>
<p>Both head's giggled. &quot;Why would we want that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because a star is one of the most powerful things in the
universe. If you had it, well, you'd be more powerful than our King!&quot;</p>
<p>Both heads looked dumbstruck. &quot;More-&quot; one head said.</p>
<p>&quot;-Powerful?&quot; the other head continued.</p>
<p>Speedy nodded slowly. &quot;Join me, and we can be the most
powerful boos ever!&quot;</p>
<p>Stretch let Speedy go who in turn clicked down his water filled
visor over his eyes. &quot;Let's roll!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Back inside.</strong></p>
<p>&quot;WEEGEE! KINGBOOANDDARKBOOANDBIGBOOAREINYOURBASEMENT!&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi flipped out of his seat. &quot;HOW?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;IDUNNO!&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi got up and took a deep breath. &quot;Okay, so we have no
power, just a few candles, a crazy microwave, no weapons, and it's
storming something fierce outside. What can we do?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Run and scream and hide?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sounds like a plan to-&quot;</p>
<p>There was a knock on the front door. Immediately the Poltergust
9000 &frac12; beeped again.</p>
<p>&quot;Should we answer it, Weegee?&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi swallowed hard. &quot;G-guess so. I mean, if King Boo is
already in here it can't possibly get worse&hellip;&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi crept towards the front door, his rapid heartbeat almost
drowning out the sound of the rain pouring. He held on to the door
knob for a moment and then swung it open quickly.</p>
<p>Speedy smiled sweetly. &quot;Hello, would you like to buy some
Booscout cookies?&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi turned white as a, well, boo.</p>
<p>&quot;You too?!&quot; Boo exclaimed.</p>
<p>Speedy pushed the door completely open and invited himself in with
Stretch close behind. &quot;Handover the star, and no one gets hurt.&quot;</p>
<p>King Boo revealed himself from where he'd been hiding in the
kitchen.</p>
<p>&quot;You again! And Stretch too? Luigi is mine!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Guys?&quot; Stretch spoke up.</p>
<p>&quot;No, he's mine!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;ENOUGH! How dare you argue with your King!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Guys?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're the King of my musty socks, that is!&quot;</p>
<p>King Boo sighed. &quot;We don't wear socks, imbecile!&quot;</p>
<p>Speedy crossed his arms defiantly. &quot;Maybe I do. You don't
know me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;GUYS?!&quot; King Boo and Speedy looked at Stretch like he
was a freak. &quot;Luigi and Boo ran upstairs&hellip;.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;NOOOO!&quot; King Boo and Speedy screamed at the same time.</p>
<p>Upstairs Luigi and Boo had ran into a guest bedroom and locked the
door. Luigi leaned his back against it as Boo nervously pace in
circles.</p>
<p>&quot;I got it!&quot; Luigi exclaimed with a smile on his face.</p>
<p>Boo stopped. &quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I saw this extremely obscure movie once, and it was about a
single kid to thwarted the efforts of professional thieves in his own
house. He used all kinds of tricks and traps to kick em out. Maybe we
can do that?&quot;</p>
<p>Boo looked at Luigi curiously. &quot;Think that will work?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, it'll work. It'll have to work. Sometimes you don't
need fancy technology for home security, but instead a little
ingenuity.&quot;</p>
<p>Boo could practically see the lightbulb above Luigi's head. &quot;I
feel you, Weegee. But uh, I'll follow your lead.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fine, I have some things in the attic to use. Let's scram
before they realize where we went.&quot; Luigi cracked open the door
to peek down the hallway. When he still heard arguing voices below
from their unwelcome guests, he and Boo ran opposite of the stairs to
the ladder leading to the attic.</p>

<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p><em>Bowser's Pov.</em></p>
<p>My plan was flawless. Peach was almost asking for it&hellip; Well
more than usual, with her not having security and what not. So her
and her bozo citizens were just waiting in line to ride that new Sky
Cannon thing. All it took was for some of my Goomba foot soldiers to
aim the cannon loaded with Peach straight to my castle. What was
Mario gonna do, roll himself into a ball and launch himself?</p>
<p>Well, that's just what the pesky plumber did. He went through my
whole castle like a BALL and even managed to defeat me like this. I
hate balls! Er, nevermind. Anyway, he used his paddle things against
ME, and shot me out of my own home! Dang, shot me far too. I don't
know if he was using titanium paddles or what cause he shot me into
SPACE!</p>
<p>Eh, I'll be back next week. Cause for me, this just meant another
visit with&hellip;her again&hellip;.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>The Comet Observatory had just made another orbit around the
galaxy when Polari, the Black Luma, spotted something on the radar.
&quot;Head's up, your highness. We have another defeated villain
heading this way!&quot; He glanced back to Rosalina, who was
partially obscured by smoke.</p>
<p>&quot;Mario's special one must have been in danger. It's Bowser
again,&quot; Rosalina mused, the platinum blonde princess lounging on
her throne casually. &quot;Oh, and you can open the window if you
wish, Polari.&quot;</p>
<p>Polari chucked. &quot;I'm used to it, your highness. It's only
been a few thousand years!&quot;</p>
<p>The two deific beings laughed as a solid thud was heard nearby,
signaling Bowser's painful landing.</p>
<p>Watchdog Lumas worked up a frenzy, immediately swarming around the
dazed and confused Bowser.</p>
<p>&quot;Villain launchee alert! Protect the Princess!&quot; A Luma
screamed.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p><em>Bowser's pov</em></p>
<p>I rubbed my head as these star freaks went mad around me, making
my headache worse. &quot;Shut up, already! OW!&quot; I screamed.</p>
<p>Next thing I knew, Rosalina walked up, calming her brat little
children. &quot;King Bowser,&quot; she said in a low voice.</p>
<p>I rolled my eyes. &quot;You. Nice welcoming commitee you got here.
They do this every time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's only their job. Come along,&quot; she said, leading the
way back into her observation room. I was annoyed, but she was my
only ticket home. Might as well.</p>
<p>Her observation room was this neat little lodge area. I'll have to
admit I'm impressed everytime I see it. Too bad about that smoke
smell. Polari also gave me look upon seeing Rosalina return with me,
but screw him. I glared back and he got the point, turning around to
focus back on the radar. As I saw Rosalina returning to her fancy
looking chair, I fanned the air. &quot;Smokier than usual eh?&quot; I
groaned.</p>
<p>Rosalina smiled, not bothering to tame the incense. &quot;Just
tell me what you did this time.&quot; She ashed it over an ash tray
that sat on the table in front of her. That was a new addition, and
it was beautiful as well, elegantly sculpted out of some kind of
light blue material. Wonder where she ordered her furniture from in
space? My castle could use a remodel or two and- I mean, wait, what's
wrong with me?</p>
<p>&quot;I don't even wanna talk about it&hellip;&quot; I exclaim,
getting back to my senses.</p>
<p>Rosalina consequently snapped her fingers, summoning two Lumas.
&quot;Prepare the Cosmic cannon-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wait, wait, okay!&quot; I stammered. Dang, she's straight to
the point today, and anything else to delay being shot through the
sky AGAIN. I took a seat on her lush dark blue carpet. &quot;So like,
the Mario idiots had this pinball canon thing at the local Fun Fair.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pinball?&quot; Rosalina asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah. It's this game we have, ahead of your time I guess.&quot;
This is an older woman, I have to remind myself. Hey, I don't judge!
&quot;Anyway fungus faces were launching themselves out of it and low
and behold, I get a report from some spies I sent down there that
Peach was gonna try it next. I told them to aim it my way and they
did! Peach was literally launched right into my palms! What could go
wrong?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I lot&hellip;&quot; Polari muttered. I gave him another
death stare. Rosalina continued to silently listen.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, you have a point, star freak. It did go horribly
wrong. Turns out that fat plumber is just as surprisingly athletic as
a ball. He went through all of the worlds justing using these pinball
paddle things with himself as the projectile. He defeated countless
members of my army that way. That's just stupid, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's stupid to go after the same princess every time,&quot;
Rosalina snarked, &quot;but pray tell, he didn't defeat YOU the same
way?&quot;</p>
<p>Ugh, I knew she would ask that. &quot;Well&hellip;he kind of
did&hellip;.But I was having an off day! Okay?! What?&quot;</p>
<p>Rosalina and Polari laughed like mad! Rosalina just laughed harder
and harder. Was it that funny?!</p>
<p>&quot;Ugh! Just launch me already!&quot; I huffed, covering my
ears.</p>
<p>Rosalina finally stopped. &quot;As you wish then&hellip;&quot; She
snapped and suddenly my world went dark. I was in some kind of tube
and I could only look upwards to see a circular opening. I could only
be inside of a giant cosmic cannon!</p>
<p>&quot;What the? This one is bigger than usual?&quot; I attempted
to scream. I couldn't tell how much anyone could hear me, or where I
even was.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>Since Bowser wasn't in a conversing mood today, Rosalina had no
choice but to grant his wish. She surely couldn't keep the Koopa King
around otherwise.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a new model,&quot; Rosalina said slyly after she heard
Bowser causing a ruckus. This cannon was indeed bigger than usual.
Rosalina had been receiving quite a lot of villains lately, and this
model, invented by her and some of her most brilliant Lumas, could
send multiple people at once. It was situated in the garage area and
her acquaintance was going to be the cannon's madien launch.</p>
<p>&quot;I enjoyed our little talk, and you were quite entertaining.
There isn't always much of that in the cold depths of space after
all, and for that thank you, Bowser. Do see me again.&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser continued in his muffled protest as Rosalina lit the fuse
with one of the incense. A second later, Bowser was sent back to
Earth with a deafening boom.</p>
<p>Polari, who had caught up just then, watched Bowser become another
twinkle in the black starry sky. The two stood silently as star-bits
hit the ground nearby. He finally turned to Rosalina.</p>
<p>&quot;You sure you want him back, your highness?&quot; he asked
with uncertainty.</p>
<p>Rosalina smiled. &quot;It doesn't matter, he will be back.&quot;</p>
<p>Another luma rushed to the two, bouncing up and down excitingly.</p>
<p>&quot;What's the matter, dear?&quot; Rosalina asked.</p>
<p>The Luma stopped and looked to the ground. &quot;Umm. Can I visit
Earth please?! There's a new video game coming out and I have to have
it!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A new videogame?&quot; Rosalina mused. She was not stranger
to videogames. She was even in a couple, as she understood, but she
had more important concerns. Still, if her children were into it.
&quot;Okay, fine. But what is it called?&quot;</p>
<p>The Luma's eyes lit up. &quot;Mario Pinball Land!&quot;</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>Kamek shook the roofing company worker's hand. He'd just finished
patching the hole in the roof from Bowser being launched.</p>
<p>&quot;I thank you for not being afraid to venture into Dark Land
for such emergency repairs,&quot; Kamek said sincerely.</p>
<p>The worker shrugged. &quot;Sure, anything for the Koopa Kingdom.
Say, what went through this roof anyway? That hole was the size of
five Koopas!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing!&quot; Kamek answered quickly.</p>
<p>Just then there was another crash! Bowser had returned from space,
making another hole in the roof. Rock and dust filled Bowser's room
once more and the commotion summoned guards to the area.</p>
<p>&quot;What the?!&quot; the worker gawked.</p>
<p>&quot;Her aiming skills have improved,&quot; Kamek thought to
himself.</p>
<p>&quot;Where were you?&quot; Koopas asked as they swarmed Bowser,
not entirely unlike before.</p>
<p>Bowser groggily sat up. &quot;Just visiting an old friend...&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Luigi's POV.</strong></p>
<p>Me and my brother Mario, had Bowser cornered. It was about time,
we'd traversed through seven lands to foil one of Bowser's schemes
once again, and boy, it wasn't easy. Many lives were lost, and
powerups ran through. We'd made it though, and now that Bowser had
been bopped several times by the both of us, it was just a matter of
finishing the job. Me and Mario stood on each side of the rotten
King. I had my fire power up still, but Mario, being a less cautious
like me as usual, got himself hit a few times. He was small Mario.</p>
<p>&quot;Weegee?&quot; Mario asked. &quot;I'll let you do the honor.&quot;</p>
<p>My heart fluttered at the opportunity. He was letting me do this?
But wait, why? Mario was probably just saying that because he didn't
have a powerup. Yeah, that's it. Would he do the same if the
situation was reversed? Probably not. That's life.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, okay bro!&quot; I replied, trying to not let sound like
he was getting to me. I shot a fireball at Bowser.</p>
<p>&quot;Yow!&quot; Bowser cried, helplessly squirming around. &quot;Just
end the game already, you useless plumbers!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, I got an idea...&quot; I mumbled without thinking. I
approached Bowser something compelled me to start going through his
pockets. Mario observed me all wierd and then jumped back when I
jolted up with my prize.</p>
<p>A coin! Wait...that's what I was looking for?</p>
<p>&quot;What is it, bro?&quot; Mario asked.</p>
<p>&quot;A...a coin?&quot; I stared at in in my hand for a while. Why
did I do this?</p>
<p>Mario wagged his finger in his annoying big brother way. &quot;It's
not about the treasure, Luigi!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wa! It's always about the treasure! WAHA HA HA!&quot; I
blurted out. Then covered my mouth embarrassingly. What the heck?</p>
<p>Mario pouted. Of course, I was just annoying him. Never mind it
was him who went through most of our powerup supply because he
wouldn't look before he leaped, or the auto scroll wouldn't move fast
enough, or he'd risk it for a Star Coin knowing we could retry the
level any time for it! What was I talking about? Oh yeah, Mario
bopped on Bowser one more time and the king gave up. Whatever
happened to letting me finish the job?</p>
<p>Whatever. I was one coin richer than him, oh yeah! Go Weegee&hellip;.Uhg.</p>
<p>Later that day, after the usual crap that happened when I..I mean
Mario of course, saved the day, there was nothing to do. We were home
again, and I was chilling on my bed, trying to, I don't know, WIND
DOWN like normal people do after grueling adventures when Mario was
still bouncing around the place.</p>
<p>Wonder why he's never lost weight?</p>
<p>Anyway, Mario barged into our room, which isn't really barging I
guess if we both own it, but whatever, this is my story&hellip;</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, Weegee! How about a tennis game!&quot; Mario said in
his usual strident fashion.</p>
<p>I put my magazine of choice &quot;Green Magazine&quot; down.
&quot;Today?!&quot;</p>
<p>Mario nodded eagerly. I couldn't be annoyed. Mario seemed to
carefree, so happy, he was like a cartoon character. &quot;Even
Bowser will play with us!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bowser?&quot; I asked. After we just beat his butt two hours
ago? Was the Koopa King bipolar or stupid?</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah. Come on, we can beat him. Let's-a go!&quot; Mario did
an unnecessary somersault from the doorway into the middle of our
room. He dropped to his knees and reached under his bed for
something. A moment later he pulled out his custom made 'M' emblem
racket, and mine too. It looked like his, but with an 'L'. What did
you expect my racket to have, a 'W'?</p>
<p>What an oddly specific letter to think of...</p>
<p>Mario tossed to to me, without me being ready and waltzed out of
the room, like he expected me to follow or something...Well it
worked, because I did. You win this time, big bro.</p>
<p>The match ended up being at the generic grass course that was
bland and well, grassy. It offended or interested no one, so it was
perfect for mindless games of tennis. The weather was nice at least
and the area it was in was away from downtown Toad Town, so it was
quiet as well. Maybe this wouldn't be that bad...</p>
<p>Mario and I went through the gates and a few friends were already
on field. I saw the princesses, Yoshi, Toad, Koopa, Bowser and his
bratty son of course, and a few non participants, like Kylie Koopa to
reporter.</p>
<p>She took a million pictures, in the span of time it took to walk
past her. Anyway, we had our greetings and Mario bounced around like
usual.</p>
<p>&quot;Grr! So you finally showed up after that beating I gave
you!&quot; Bowser gloated.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm-a gonna get you!&quot; Mario said back to his face. This
was so staged, how did anyone believe it? Mario and the rest kind of
grouped together on the opposite side of Bowser and Junior like a
standoff of sorts. I was still standing off to the side near Kylie.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, can I get a group picture of you peeps?&quot; Kylie
asked holding her camera. I never noticed how nice those earrings of
hers looked. Those pink diamond earrings. Those expensive diamond
earrings...</p>
<p>Mario and the rest, even Bowser, grouped together for a photo with
the field in the background. I was left out of it, and no one noticed
of course.</p>
<p>&quot;Cheese!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Cheese!&quot; everyone repeated. The flash went off, and
their smiles dropped so they could pretend to be angry and stuff
again. Suddenly I heard Kylie gasp.</p>
<p>Kylie looked around her. &quot;My earrings! Where did they go?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Look on the ground,&quot; Daisy said quickly.</p>
<p>&quot;Sister, they were just on! How did- what's that?&quot; She
gave me a weird look. And then I realized why.</p>
<p>The earrings were in my hands&hellip;.</p>

<p><strong>BONUS:</strong></p>
<p>(Original) Summary: Luigi slowly develops a split personality, and
it isn't Mr. L, or any other cliche. He isn't abused either (another
cliche in itself), but there will be angst (so I guess you can't
escape all cliches after all). You'll never believe what it actually
is!</p>

<p><strong>Luigi's Split Personality, part 2</strong></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>All of those shocked faces pointing my way! The worst part were
the eyes like lasers impaling my body, including my heart.. My chest
tightened as the sunlight seemed to blaze and blind me. My knees
weakened as my posture slumped and the world turned sideways. I was
gonna be si!-</p>
<p>&quot;Oh Luigi found them!&quot;</p>
<p>Kylie the Koopa reporter snatched the earrings away from my
jittery palms. Oh yeah. I was kind of holding the evidence under
everyone's noses. The reporter stared at the gold jewelry closely and
then her lips made a thin line. &quot;The diamonds are missing ya
know,&quot; she remarked sharply. I gulped while others groaned.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe they popped out when they hit the floor,&quot; Daisy
suggested, stepping up a little closer. I could tell from the look on
her face is was annoyed.</p>
<p>Peach shook her head. &quot;I don't think so, Daisy. Those kinds
of earrings are held together by a screw. Someone would have to be a
talented and natural scoundrel to do it so quickly and seamlessly.</p>
<p>I felt sick again and I didn't know why. Those things were NOT me
so why was I so.. a mess?</p>
<p>Bowser emitted a low growl, stepping up and shoving everyone aside
to get to Kylie. &quot;Listen, this is going on WAY TOO LONG!
Reporter chick can glue back together her tacky jewelry on the
sidelines. Let's get to the flipping game already!&quot; His outburst
seemed to shake everyone to the core and the message got through.
There was a game to be at hand and no one took sports more seriously
than Mario!</p>
<p>Kylie stomped off I saw and then the crew made their may back to
the court, leaving me. Sweet relief! Saved by Bowser! I plopped down
on the metal sideline bench like a few others, under half of a nearby
palm tree specifically so I didn't faint. That was freaking weird as
heck. Only a professional thug like Larry Koopa could do that.</p>
<p>Larry&hellip; Hmm. NO. Unless. Why'd I think of him? Me and
Koopalings mixed like blooper ink and water&hellip; Uhg. Now I know
why I blotted it out. I did try to reach out but only because Larry
dealt with digital currency and he had this digital casino thing.
Don't judge me, Wario took my wallet last Mario Kart and I couldn't
even get it back because the douche lost it himself. That was a nice
wallet. I was green. You know how rare those things are?</p>
<p>Thinking so much uncharacteristically made me tired. I leaned on
my left elbow as my eye lids got heavier than a thwomp. Very weird as
heck, I reiterated as one lid dropped. Very.. very.. weird.. And that
was it. I was gonna sleep through a game and that was okay.</p>
<p>Ouch, what the?!</p>
<p>I aggressively lifted back up as laying my body on the side of the
bleachers got me stabbed by something in my side pocket I don't
remember being there. What? A little screwdriver? How?</p>
<p>Next. I don't know why but my neck craned to the right and there
was Bowser Junior going between watching his dad, hogging up the best
shady spot, and playing his Nintendo Switch. Dare I ask?</p>
<p>&quot;This isn't yours is it?&quot; I asked him. Perhaps his six
year old child not only stole the diamonds from the earrings that he
snatched from the most hawk eyed reporter without anyone noticing,
but maybe he slipped it in my pockets too, even though I'm extremely
sensitive to the touch-</p>
<p>No you idiot! My hand ran through my hair, slightly matted by the
sweat.</p>
<p>&quot;I was having a totally super hard pro gamer Fox only Final
Destination no items match. Now what?&quot; Junior replied literally
five minutes later, giving the game a rest on his lap.</p>
<p>I mumbled something because by then I was busy with a new
activity. It was a vague feeling. I was doing 'something' and
intellectually and artsy, yet a part of my consciousness was missing.
I just knew it was <em>totally cool wicked</em>!</p>
<p>Junior curiously faced my way for the first time and gasped. &quot;MY
SPECIAL THINGY!&quot; In childish rage he flung that Switch down to
the ground. Clack! The Joy-Cons detached and bounced all the way to
the tennis field and under Yoshi's feet. He slipped just as the ball
was heading his way and it flew over his head and whacked into his
doubles partner Mario's gut, which bounced it again to the left where
Peach sat in the umpire seat sipping tea. The rogue controller
shattered her glass and made her stumble back which meant that Toad
got splashed with the liquid and with that, the score sheet was
ruined. The game was over.</p>
<p>&quot;Ahhh! Noooo! We were wining!&quot; Bowser roared. He glanced
to Daisy, his doubles partner, and the princess was about to blow up
as well.</p>
<p>Peach dusted off from the back flip and with a huff snatched up
the chipped Joy Con. &quot;Who is responsible for this?&quot; she all
but piercingly screamed.</p>
<p>I saw Bowser's red eyes drag across the field to the bleachers and
rest his son stomping the ground.</p>
<p>Junior's finger jut out at my face. &quot;I only threw it because
he stole my stuff!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Liar,&quot; I replied immediately. &quot;We've been next to
each other the entire time so how did I try anything? And look, you
graffiti the entire spot in front of us with 'Mario sucks, Junior
rules.' Who else would write that? Hey, you over there is a witness
too,&quot; I pointed out to Kylie Koopa. She'd not entirely left the
scene after all and was at the far opposite end of the bleachers,
still snapping photos I'd notice some time, even if dejectedly.</p>
<p>The middle aged koopa woman however gave me the most pitiful look.
She clicked her tongue and then folder her arms, leaving the camera
to dangle around her neck. &quot;Listen sticky-fingers. If ya gonna
try to use me as a witness of your <em>innocence</em>, don't use the
very thing ya stole to point at me.&quot;</p>
<p>My eyebrow shifted downwards, as I was taken back. The stuck the
thing I'd pointed with under my elbow so that I could in turn fold my
arms as the ridiculousness of that. Problem was, that object was the
magic paintbrush, or as I once knew it the Gaddbrush or as I knew it
in that moment the 'Luigi-your-screwed-brush'.</p>

<p><strong>Weird and Rude conversation: Flare meets Bowserman?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Originally completed 12/1/15</strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary: (AU) Bowserman is an entertainer and Bowser
impersonator. Flare the podoboo is a plumber. What will happen when
they are put in a room together? -Along with with a bit of &quot;help&quot;
from a Boo, of course. (Contains OCs)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer: I don't own &quot;Bowser&quot;, &quot;podoboo&quot;,
&quot;boo&quot; or anything else Mario related here. I especially
don't own that 'let the bodies hit the floor' song.</strong></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>Bowserman entered from stage left. And by that we mean a random
door into blank white room.</p>
<p>Bowserman (who will be called 'Bowser' for short) is a six foot
Koopa wearing a black tank top with designer jeans and sunglasses. He
has prominent horns and a large spiky shell, giving him an uncanny
resemblance to the Koopa King Bowser, no doubt influencing his stage
name. The only difference is that Bowserman has a large unkempt black
beard. 'Bowser' and his sister Destructo own BM+DK, a fashion
accessory line and talk show aimed at super villains. With their
products and show being a huge hit, Bowser has much fame in the area.</p>
<p>&quot;The one and only Bowserman is here!&quot; he loudly
announced as he approached Flare. She was sweeping with a broom
around the two chairs and table in the otherwise empty room.</p>
<p>Flare is a podoboo with a typical podoboo appearance, that being a
flaming fireball with eyes. She also co-owner of the publishing and
plumbing company, Red Plum that she owns with her husband and family.
They are a direct competitor with the 'Mario bros' plumbing shop.
Flare is basically a nobody and far from famous.</p>
<p>&quot;What are you? Some celebrity?&quot; Flare said without
looking away from the broom.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh yeah! I'm the host of the Bowserman and Distructo Koopa
show,&quot; Bowserman said as if it was common knowledge.</p>
<p>&quot;So you are some entertainer, huh?&quot; Flare asked sharply.</p>
<p>&quot;Yo, only the best in town. BM+DK, yeah!&quot; he replied,
leaning on the tabletop.</p>
<p>&quot;If you say so,&quot; Flare said as she finally took a glance
at Bowserman. A flash of disgust came across her face and she
returned to her self imposed chores.</p>
<p>&quot;So umm, you're a plumber right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh hmm,&quot; she mumbled fully engrossed in her work.</p>
<p>Sweeping was Flare's favorite necessary chore. Once her family had
to stage an intervention over it. Flare was no longer 'obsessed' with
it but she'd take it over interacting any farther with Bowserman.
Bowser took a seat in one of the chairs. He was a true entertainer
and loved meeting new people so he was determined to get to know
Flare better.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah yeah. I can respect that girl,&quot; he said while
simultaneously tapping his chest in an &quot;urban&quot; sign of
respect. Flare didn't see the kindly gesture but did take offense to
his comment.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm old enough to be your mother,&quot; she stated matter of
factly.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I dig that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You dug up what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, I like your uh, age and beauty?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm married too.&quot;</p>
<p>He had no intention of appearing to hit on Flare. She was
definitely not his type. However unlike his more charismatic sister,
Destructo, Bowser often played on the responses of others; in
situations where he wasn't getting much response from the other
person, he was suddenly awkward. Just before he could think of a way
to change the conversation Flare suddenly dropped her broom and
stared upward. Bowserman also looked upwards towards the plain white
ceiling and saw no source of the light. This instantly freaked him
out.</p>
<p>&quot;Flare, you alright?&quot; Bowser said as he got up from the
chair and made his way towards Flare.</p>
<p>Suddenly a beam of light appeared over her. Bowser was knocked
back by an invisible force and a blinding light obscured his view of
anything else.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>&quot;Hey kid, now are you alright?&quot; Bowserman heard a
familiar voice say. His vision cleared and he saw Flare standing in
in front of him with a quizzical look.</p>
<p>&quot;Girl, what was that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What was what, hon?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That- that light thing. From the ceiling and? I-
nevermind...&quot; Bowser trailed off starting to believe he was more
sleep deprived than he thought.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh well then. I'm pleased to meet you Mr. Bowserman. Your
talk show is wonderful,&quot; Flare said in an uncharacteristically
sweet way. She walked to the chair on her side of the table, not
giving the broom on the floor a glance. This instantly made Bowser
suspicious.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't you want to take a seat?&quot; Flare suggested. Bowser
complied hesitantly.</p>
<p>&quot;Well?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh&hellip;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Again, I think your show has helped improve hero villain
relations.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah it has. We're all people too,&quot; He said starting to
get comfortable again.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes wonderful. So what's your workout routine?&quot; Flare
said now in a lower voice while staring him down.</p>
<p>Bowser did indeed work out. It wasn't something he's serious about
but he had to keep up appearances being a male celebrity and all.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, a bit of cardio, some laps, a bit of swimming. Wait,
why?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let's just say if someone theoretically had a husband that's
picked up a few pounds and refused to go to the gym despite the pleas
of his loving, beautiful wife and blames the weight on my- I mean the
wife's cooking which can't be the case because I- I mean the wife
only uses low fat products and he says the gym is a ripoff but it
isn't if you use a coupon that she could print if only he bothered to
change the ink.-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;-But he doesn't trust the print store because they ruined
our- I mean their sales posters so basically you need to order it
online but the office computer has viruses from my- I mean his, her,
whatever cousins playing on it a week before. So basically this wife
just wants a ripped husband to stick it to her neighborhood club
leader's wife and prove he's not a loser. So, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY THIS
THIS THEORETICAL WIFE?&quot; She screamed with a crazed look.</p>
<p>&quot;D-dude&hellip;&quot; Bowser was debating at this point if he
should just run. All hope was lost for a normal conversation in his
mind. &quot;You don't have to make friends with everyone,&quot; he
reasoned, especially the crazies. After glancing around he started to
panic more when he couldn't find an door. <em>Not even the one he
entered through.</em></p>
<p>&quot;I gotta go...&quot; he said while getting up and backing
away.</p>
<p>&quot;Listen kid,&quot; she pouted &quot;hey listen! Don't move!&quot;
she suddenly shouted. Bowserman obeyed as Flare's authoritative tone
was oddly effective.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm fine okay?&quot; She continued, &quot;I have to be like
this because the plot demands so.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The plot.&quot;</p>
<p>Then the camera dramatically zoomed in on Flare's face...</p>
<p>&quot;Guess what son,&quot; she said plainly, &quot;That light
beam was a message from beyond and I tell you, LET THE BODIES HIT THE
FLOOR-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;WHAT?!&quot;</p>
<p>Bowserman freaked out. He ran toward one of the walls and
frantically beat on it.</p>
<p>&quot;Let me out let me out let me out-!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just kidding. That was Amia communicating with me. She's my
daughter. And that weird thing was lyrics from a song my little
cousins were listening to.&quot;</p>
<p>Bowserman looked back unsure. Flare seemed nice if not defensive
at first. Flare tilted her head.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, kids these days do have strange music tastes&hellip;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay then but, why the heel turn?&quot; he said as he turned
around.</p>
<p>&quot;I just told you. We weren't engaged.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But you said you were married right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not that kind of engage. Uhg, just whatever!&quot; She got
up from the chair and looked above. &quot;I'm done here,&quot; she
said to the ceiling.</p>
<p>&quot;But MOM?!&quot; a monstrous yet whiny voice thundered,
appearing to come from nowhere.</p>
<p>&quot;No 'buts' Missy. We are done here. He's just like the rest
of our entertainers these days. All cheese, no ham. You know what I
mean?&quot;</p>
<p>Flare and the voice broke out in laughter. However the voice's
laughter shook the room freaking Bowser out again.</p>
<p>&quot;That voice is your daughter's? You people are crazy!&quot;
By this point, Bowser's fake urban accent was long gone and he now
sounded vaguely European.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Bowserman, you lasted a while-&quot; the voice replied,
&quot;People usually say that about us in the first five minutes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;C-can I just leave?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure dude. Oh and pleased to meet you. I'm Amia, we've met
before.&quot;</p>
<p>In a poof, Amia appeared in the middle of the room. She was a
shifty eyed Boo wearing only a sergeant hat labeled &quot;S&quot;.
The force of her arrival knocked over the nearby table and chairs but
it was otherwise less spectacular than the situation before with
Flare. She stood stoically near the mess she made and after a quick
glance around the room simply shrugged.</p>
<p>&quot;Meh. Nothing is broken at least&hellip;&quot; Her was voice
no longer monstrous but monotonous.</p>
<p>&quot;Who are you again?&quot; Bowserman said now more confused
than frightened.</p>
<p>&quot;So you don't remember? Season 5 episode 3 during your 'call
a guest' special. I was called on stage and you even shook my hand
come on, dude!&quot; Amia suddenly whined.</p>
<p>&quot;Amia! He's older than you, but most importantly he's rich.
You'd better respect him,&quot; Flare said in her signature
authoritative tone.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes ma'am,&quot; Amia instantly calmed down, presumably for
her own good. Flare's tone worked again.</p>
<p>&quot;So that thing before with the light,&quot; Bowser started
again.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh Amia just likes to show off,&quot; Flare said.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not, mom.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So like how is she your mother? You being a podoboo and her
being a boo?... I mean uh, no offense?&quot; Bowser realized he'd
made a big mistake.</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; Amia and Flare said with distraught face.</p>
<p>Okay so Amia is Flare's stepdaughter. Still, that's probably
something that one shouldn't bring up.</p>
<p>&quot;Please I- I just want to go. Is this a hostage situation?
There's no doors- do you want money? Just- just LET ME OUT!&quot;
Bowserman shrieked.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay.&quot;</p>
<p>Amia pulled out an electronic device and pressed a button. The
door Bowser and Flare entered in appeared once more.</p>
<p>&quot;Heh, I just hid the door to 'encourage' discussion.&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser looked towards the door and then back to Amia with
suspicion.</p>
<p>&quot;So, how can you get away with that? The BM+DK show doesn't
even get away with kidnapping guests, and we get away with a lot of
other things&quot;</p>
<p>The show indeed does. Highlights include staging a &quot;wear no
pants day&quot;, using dangerous chemicals see which one melts metal
bars the quickest on stage, and hosting an unofficial Death Machine
parade. Kidnapping guests however is going way too far for BM+DK.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey like, don't even think about suing. It's in the
contract, dude.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What contract?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Amia! Let him go!&quot; Flare interrupted.</p>
<p>&quot;Mom, I'm just establishing our legal standings here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever, later. BM is out, yo yo!&quot; His urban accent
was back in full force as he took his leave.</p>
<p>Amia and Flare followed. Outside the room, they were in a Park the
middle of the city park. The room they had just exited was gone,
leaving only a door. The room didn't actually exist in this
dimension, it was just a conference room literally in the middle of
nowhere Amia could access with her own otherworldly powers.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it went alright, mom&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never again, sweety.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, but you liked my effects right?&quot;</p>
<p>Amia was deeply sensitive about her theatrics, ever since she got
booed (no pun intended) off of the stage of a high school talent
show. That however is another story...</p>
<p>&quot;No. Oh and watch yourself with these blank white rooms. You
can make people crazy with your tricks. I just- oh look at the time!&quot;</p>
<p>Flare had to run off. She took her leave in a hurry towards her
family plumbing shop just two blocks away from the park to attend to
business. She was already a few minutes pass her break time so for
once, she was the late one. Her workmates would be sure to make fun
of her for that. Amia, understanding Flare's sudden leave, felt
slightly guilty for making her late. She then teleported to Super
Flat Zone, where she frequently hung out with her friend Mr. Game
&amp;Watch.</p>
<p>But what about Bowserman? He had fled to the other side of the
Park and hid in a bush, an effort to avoid being seen until an
special vehicle could pick him up. After hiding for twenty minutes,
the car arrived. Bowser noticed it took a mad dash towards it before
too many park goers could spot him and take pictures. Once inside he
was greeted by his sister.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, bro h- whoa! Are you well?&quot; Distructo asked in a
European accent. The siblings didn't even bother with the fake urban
accent with each other.</p>
<p>&quot;Too much,&quot; he huffed.</p>
<p>&quot;Well did you meet Flare? Was was this whole thing?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<em>One weird and rude conversation</em>&hellip;&quot;</p>
<p><strong>The End.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Author note: This is my first submission here, but far
from my first story ever written (not that I'm saying I'm really good
or anything). That being said, this is alternate universe as most of
my work is. Hopefully you won't find the pace too slow. Often with my
original fiction I have inside jokes and whatnot that only me and and
closer acquaintances would get, but I've tried to eliminate a lot of
that here, for the sake of having something that the general public
can enjoy. So, if something does not make sense, please pm me or
mention it in a review.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Oh, and 'Amia' is not a self insert. You'll only realize
why I'm saying that if you visit my bio though. Lastly, feel free to
give any feedback you deem necessary. I won't bite!</strong></p>
