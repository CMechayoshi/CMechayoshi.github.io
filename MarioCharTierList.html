	<H1>Nintendo's Mario Tier List (Under construction)</H1>

<img src="images/my-image.png" alt="mario character tier lists">
<p style="text-align:center"><em>Image courtesy of the huge watermark. Note that this does not perfectly reflect the descriptions below, nor does it include all the characters discussed in this article.</em></p>

<p>This article will be about Mario characters and their popularity and 'ranking' from Nintendo's standpoint. We'll be primarily judging this by noting who appears in what games. Pay attention to the distinction between ‘main series and ‘spin-off’ games.
 </p>

<p><b>-Main series:</b> Super Mario Bros 2D and 3D platforming games. This includes fusion 3D Land/World. This would even include, if antiquated, Super Mario Land.</p>

<p><b>-Spin-off games:</b> Mario Kart, Mario Party, sports, RPGs, arcade, and puzzle games. Luigi’s Mansion. Mario + Rabbids. Sub-franchises belonging to Yoshi, Donkey Kong, and Wario are included here, at least pertaining to the main characters.</p>

<p><b>-And we won't count at all:</b>Movies, comics, other outside media, though we might mention it</p>

<h3>How do we rank?</h3>

<p><b>Visibility:</b> Do you see this character? Simple but it matters. One might consider both Toad and Wario to be mainish side characters, yet their track record of appearances in the above categories will differ considerably. There are reasons for this as we’ll dissect: some of them have their own series, some were created much earlier or later than others, some are having a resurgence due to aligning with Nintendo’s current interests or philosophy for the time (see individual spotlights). <em>Do cameos count?</em> Depends. Usually we are counting the character appearing in person, not as a small bonus sticker, skin, or trophy.</p>



<p><b>Playability:</b> Can you play as them? This is where the main and spin-off series differ from the start, one not necessarily prioritizing a large roster compared to the other. Will they be merely aesthetic (rare, but happens) or have different stats (usually the case)? If someone is an enemy, you can usually forget playing as them in a main-series game, which hurts the scores of a few automatically. Spin-offs are far kinder however, even for ‘bad guys’! 
</p>

<h2>Tier 1:</h2>

		

<p style="text-align:center"><b>Mario<br>
<img src="Additionalphotos/Mario.png" alt="first tier">
Visibility: 5/5 (main and spinoffs)<br>
Playable: 5/5  
</b> </p>

<p>Mario is the guy that even non-gamers can pick out in a lineup easily, so it’s a great thing he’s such a law abiding citizen, even getting top billing on a few games where you spend a lot of time playing other characters first (think the Mario Tennis/Golf 	Camelot titles). His characterization is typically on guard, nothing too extreme in main series games, though spin-offs can and will slip in some extra angles. He might be super competitive, goofy, a semi-unaware casanova, etc. Outside of his early girlfriend Pauline, the ‘romantic’ connections don’t go beyond a puppy love. Odyssey presenting him as overly romantic towards Peach is, besides fan-fic fuel, more of an anomaly. It’s possible to get in-game dialogue from beyond a ‘Ya-hoo!’, but you have to look close. Interestingly in some old manuals, like Super Mario World or Super Mario Land 2, Mario is a narrator talking to you. His social life involves everyone in the universe knowing who he is.</p>

<p>Well, that’s it for him but trust me, it gets more intriguing as we sort through the rest of his buddies. 
</p>

	
<p style="text-align:center"><b>
Peach<br>
<img src="Additionalphotos/Peach.jpg" alt="first tier">

V: 5/5 (main and spin) <br>
P: 1/5 or 2/5 main series, 5/5 spin-offs.</b><br></p>

<p>Princess of the Mushroom Kingdom, debuting in Super Mario Bros. 1. She is almost always the center of the conflict due to her less than stellar kingdom defense force. This created a situation where her visibility is as great as Mario’s, sometimes even getting some appearances that Luigi doesn’t get, yet you can’t play as her because she’s being held hostage! Her character is being revisioned in line with current day politics (not to open a can of worms, just commenting matter of factly here) to not be kidnapped so much and even be a playable character, but none of this is totally new. Super Princess Peach was a quirky but legit thing back in the day or WAY before then SMB2. Later, before Wonder really busted the roster open, we got her to show in 3D World, Super Mario Run and (via cheating in a way) Super Mario Bros U. Her characterization is, somewhat like Mario, closely monitored to be normalish, sometimes playful, and very concerned about those around her. RPGs offer her a little more action, perhaps allowing her to aid her own rescue by being sly and using social engineering. Romantically she is, unfortunately, quite a tease to Mario, but has a health social life otherwise. She knows other monarchs, has toads that lover her, a ‘grandpa’ that worries sick over her.. Not too different. </p> 

<p>There weren’t a lot of NES sports games, but she (and Daisy in an early appearance) were in NES Open Tournament golf. Spin offs are super kind to her, often only female rep in SNES and N64 games. She’s playable in the Game and Watch Gallery series. She was in Smash bros from Melee onwards. Overall, it’s too early to totally revise her playable rating for main series games, but I’ll add an extra point to reflect what I believe to be her current trajectory.
</p>


<p style="text-align:center"><b>Bowser<br>
<img src="Additionalphotos/Bowser.jpg" alt="first tier">
V: 5/5 (main and spin)<br>
P: 1/5 main 4/5 spin</b><p>



<p>It’s freaking Bowser, the bad guy responsible for most conflicts. In fact in some of the few instances where he isn't, he manages to squeeze himself in anyway. Justifiably he's not often playable in main games. Characterization varies between cruel and mean, or comic reliefy and goofy. In spin off games except most of the Mario Parties he fares better but not as good as you might think. You can play him in all Mario Karts but not in most Mario Parties. The RPG’s are normally not playable for him unless it’s Super Mario RPG, Bowser’s Inside Story, and Super Paper Mario. Mario Tennis and Golf are normally good for him but not puzzle games. He is a Smash bros character as of Melee. </p>

<p>Kinda like Peach, there are often ‘plot’, yes, even for a Mario game, reasons behind what you can do with him. There was an interesting interview I read back in the day regarding SPM and how they had to think very carefully about if Bowser was to be a good guy going forward. Obviously not, but that does lampshade his frenemy angle, resulting in a recognized ‘Go-Karting with Bowser’ trope serves him well, as he fits in situations where other Mario antagonists that might technically have more going for them wouldn’t. </p> 




<p style="text-align:center"><b>Luigi<br>
<img src="Additionalphotos/IMG_1100.JPG" alt="first tier">

V: 4.5/5 (both)<br>
P: 4/5 main 5/5 spin 
</b></p>

<p> This younger leaner Mario brother is another star, at least in main series games. For spin-offs relating to sports and recreation he is also a guaranteed inclusion, yet for RPGs there’s a catch. He will always show up somewhere, but if it’s not a Mario and Luigi game you might not be able to control him. Sometimes there’s some plot justification. For Paper Mario the emphasis is placed on the various partners of Mario, meanwhile Luigi is free to do his own thing or have his own adventures or whatever. </p>

<p>In other places the excuse is hard to find however. In some modern games he can be restricted as a player two option (NSMB) or an end of game completion trophy, like the first Mario Galaxy. Super Mario 64 or Sunshine famously omit him completely and in Odyssey he merely cameos! He famously had to rescue Mario in an education game where Mario went missing. (Guess the title) He later got his own franchise of the Luigi’s Mansion games (even if it took a while to get some sequels), where YOU (again) do the rescuing of Mario and whoever else. He got into the first Smash Bros, where the slots were pretty tight, so give him credit there. Yes, also his Year of Luigi did work in his favor, giving him more appearances. <p>

<p>His characterization is allowed to be a bit looser than Mario depending on game, with the Paper Mario titles simply having him talk and tell exaggerated stories to you like a normal person. His relationship with Daisy is more of a tease deal than anything official, but it ain’t a bad ship, we’ll give you that. He has to often prove himself, and fight his own fears, but Peach does respect him and most of the good guys, except a few jerkish toads.</p>

<p>Overall he’s a very common occurrence to see and play as, even if you must plug in a second controller. As much painful as it is to see his spin off score higher than his main, not or barely appearing in some very major 3D Mario games hurts. 
</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><b>Yoshi<br>
<img src="Additionalphotos/Yoshi.jpg" alt="first tier">
V: 4/5 <br>
P: 3/5 main 4.5/5 spin.</b><p>

<p>Yoshi is more frequent than one might think as a regular and supporting character. Sometimes he can speak English, other times not, but he’s always cheerful and loyal. His abilities are distinct and his games have a specific style of play. Because some games present multiple ‘yoshies’ he does have a tiny bit of the ‘composite vs specific’ character conundrum, ala Lakitu, Koopa, Toad, Shy Guy, Birdo, etc, but of this dubious bunch, Yoshi is undoubtedly the biggest name.</p> 

<p>Both 3D and 2D main series games flip flop on if he’ll appear and be playable (ridable). He does have his own franchise however, and appears in puzzle games like Yoshi, Yoshi’s Cookie, and Tetris Attack. He has from the start almost shown up a lot in the Mario Karts, Parties, sports etc. This gives him a respectable visibility score and it’s his playability that vacillates, slapping restrictions on you and making him akin to a power up rather than a character. RPGs are okay for him cameo-wise only, and Paper Mario straight up gives him no direct appearance. (There ARE yoshis in Paper Mario titles but not our T. Yoshisaur..) Oddly, he showed in Super Mario 64 and Sunshine when Luigi didn’t. Some modern games feature Yoshi as a ‘easy mode’ option, interestingly the only time when the actual yoshi is playable as opposed to another character riding them. This association with Yoshi and more infantile matters can be a little annoying, as while the Yoshi series did take this angle early on, those games meant business beyond their colorful kiddie aesthetics. </p>

<p>Overall, he’s a very recognizable character, as reflected in his visibility score. His uniqueness is unfortunately why he can’t fit in every type of game, thus the varying playability. </p>


<p style="text-align:center"><b>Toad<br>
<img src="Additionalphotos/cc3a436e752bfc9b318b0594ba18ee1b.jpg" alt="first tier">
V: 5/5 <br>
P: 1.5/5 main, 3/5 spin</b><p>


<p>Toad? Which Toad?</P> 

<p>-The one with the red spots and indigo vest! Yes.</p>

<p>-Actually there’s more than one of those too.. Toads are ubiquitous in games starting in SMB1, normally docile but cowardly which, why Bucken-Berry and Ala-Gold (Blue and yellow toad from NSMB games) were created. Captain Toad is also an exception, debuting with his brigade in Galaxy and other 3D games and later getting a spin off puzzle game. The canonical Toad IS supposedly in Super Mario 3D World, appearing blue as nod to SMB2. (Citation: Mario Wiki: Blue Toad) Spin-off wise Wario’s Wood’s is a notable early role one might not expect, and he’s always been in Mario Karts. Aside from being an early host of Mario Parties, his sports game appearances are healthy as well. RPGs will heavily feature unplayable toads, and never present a so-called canonical Toad either. He’s not a Smash brother, but has since Melee always appeared in the game either way. Appearing in other characters’ spin off series is practically non-existent outside of Luigi Mansion roles, though this might fall under plot reasons. If it’s not a Paper Mario or otherwise RPG game where the Toads encountered have their own agency, any Toads seen otherwise usually have a direct connection to Peach. </p>

<p>The massive visibility is what carries him or them or whatever into the first tier. With their connection to Peach, they will show when she shows. Nintendo recognizes that is indeed a desire to play as (a) Toad, as the so-called canonical one appears in later Mario Parties with alternative hosts taking his role, and some of the main series games give us the Blue and Yellow ones.
</p>



<p style="text-align:center"><b>Bowser Junior<br>
<img src="Additionalphotos/Bowserjr.png" alt="first tier">

V: 4/5<br>
P: 1/5 main 3.5/5 spin 
</b></p>

<p>Mainstay despite being a relatively new addition compared to others, well, if 2002 is new. (It isn't. I know I'm old.) As a pretty major character, he replaced the Koopalings completely for a while but now exists alongside them as a superior. He’s very likely to show up in main series games 2D or 3D which is unique. He is usually found being an easy miniboss in games. His spin off count is respectable, but not perfect. He’s often in sports games, and some Mario Karts, also later Mario Parties as a replacement for the depreciated Koopa Kids. Paper Mario brought him on as a main villain from Sticker Star onward, same for later Mario & Luigi games. Smash Bros brought him on since 4. His personality is what would be expected of a koopa brat but he can be entertaining along with his dangerous plumber-killing toys, like the Koopa Clown Cars and etc. Not a ton of depth here, but since he and Koopalings can co-exist there’s little reason to hate him either.</p>

<p>He’s considered, at least by Nintendo to be a prominent character, judging by his very strong main series visibility score. For the same reasons as Bowser, he’s not always playable, though later spinoffs try to slip him in more if one is a fan.</p>

		<h2>Tier two:</h2>
	
		

<p style="text-align:center"><b>Rosalina<br>
<img src="Additionalphotos/rosalina.png" alt="second tier">
V: 2/5<br>
P: 1/5 main, 2/5 spin.</b><p>

<p>This unique goddess appeared in Mario Galaxy, and with a backstory! And a deranged fanbase too, (just look at her trauma). And we promptly forgot that backstory when we decided we needed a baby version of her!... She does have respectable appearances in modern day spin offs and is playable in 3D World. She’s been in Mario Kart since Wii and gave Smash Bros yet another Mario rep since 4. Later sports titles will let us play as her graceful self. Still, it’s early to weigh her against some of the heavyweights of the first tier, and she is mostly in side games overall outside of cameos. </p>

<p>Characterization-wise, there is much there. She has a unique environment, role, and debut. Her trajectory was aiming high, or I thought it was. Not making the cut in Super Mario Wonder was my cue to bump her down a tier. There might have been plot reasons, and I’d hate to penalize a Mario character for having lore that matters, but if other characters could be included for literally no reason she could have at least cameoed. </p>




	<img src="Additionalphotos/Daisy.png" alt="second tier">





<p><b>Daisy:</b> Princess of Sarasaland and famous for a main role in Super Mario Land to become 'spin-off Queen' from later N64 era onward. So much has already been said about her so let's keep it brief and mention some other things. She lived on through Peach for a while in Smash Bros via a color option which I always thought was interesting. Since she finally got true justice in Ultimate. Daisy in in NES open tournament Golf, yes an NES appearance as a partner for Luigi. Apparently that game started that. She's been 'tough' since Mario Party 3 where she smacks the snot out of Bowser she also at least initially had a darker skin tone than others. She sings a song on Super Mario Compact Disco where she raps and it's my favorite on the CD. No, she is not Peach's cousin despite what Prima guides will tell you. Overall there's a lot here, hopefully Nintendo wishes to unpack her character more.</p>

<p><b>Wario:</b> This guy started out in a Super Mario Land game then very quickly got his own franchise distinct from Mario. He is simply not a main series character but on the spin off side of things he became common as a token sort of bad guy along with maybe Bowser in games like Mario Party and the sports. He’s in Mario Kart consistently from 64 onward. Characterization is very consistent, not that his character hasn’t evolved a bit but from his first solo game it’s pretty close. He’s been in smash brothers since Brawl but is completely absent in RPGs.</p>


<p><b>DK:</b> Donkey Kong is a cross-over character with is his own distinct franchise. He doesn’t appear a lot in main-series games but because of his history with Mario and presence in spin offs he belongs on the list. He is a Mario Party mainstay, but if you can play as him or not depends. In Mario sports he’s sure to be around but in a few early games Donkey Kong Junior would actually be there in his place. Of course when you think about it Junior IS DK so.. Anyway, he’s a Smash Bros veteran. He has a few other points of interests, like the Mario vs Donkey Kong games, and the successor Donkey Kong for Gameboy. Characterization would be helpful, brawny, and obsessed with bananas. He thinks he can take on Bowser in some Mario Parties. In other games where he’s a good counterpart to Bowser he literally can, so that’s cool. He stops being playable for most of the Gamecube era Mario Parties but returns later so that's good.</p>


<p><b>Koopalings:</b> While major Bowser villains I'm rating them borderline after some consideration. Talking old school they are major villains in Super Mario Bros 3 and Super Mario World plus all of the extended Mario media. All else for a long time was spin-off titles if that. While that's still good, they are notably absent in the 3D Mario era onward until NSMB Wii which marked their main 'comeback'. It's weird to think that for a brief moment the Koopalings were sort of old obscureish characters, that's certainly what their showing in Superstar Saga would have seemed like. While Nintendo now uses them more, giving clarification on their relationship to Bowser for the sake of not messing up continuity with Bowser Junior hurts them somewhat. It's not nearly as interesting to simply be a minion of Bowser verses being his deranged family members. Anyway, Mario Kart 8 makes them playable so they fill the roster kind of like the babies do. Definitely love or hate it.</p>


<p><b>Waluigi:</b> I used to call him the 'Spin-off King' with Daisy being the queen. Perhaps that's a bit mean but he really does dominate Mario sports games unambiguously. Starting off in Mario Tennis 64, he's been in Mario Party since three, maybe a little earlier than one might think and can show up unexpectedly like in Game and Watch Gallery 4. He's in most modern Mario Karts which is why him missing from MK7 was such a big deal. Lastly, he's in the Dr. Mario mobile game. The fact that Nintendo keeps him away from Wario games is somewhat telling that the relationship is artificially crafted for sports games, and that's sad. A missed opportunity. His visibility rating might be a 1/5 honestly.</p>

<img src="Additionalphotos/toadette.png" alt="second tier">

<p><b>Toadette:</b> A female toad and mainish side character. Debuted later than some of the others, first in MK:DD (2003) then Wii and 8. She's a mainstay in Mario Party since 6  and in Mario Party Advance and Super Mario Party as a host. She's in some sports but not as many as others, having titles like Super Sluggers under her belt which tend to include rare characters. She's only in some modern Mario Karts. She can appear in RPG games and has roles in the Captain Toad games and later Mario tennis. She got a go in a main series game in NSMB WiiU deluxe and a few others so she's clearly elevating on the scale. I must add that last bit cynically, by the fact that she's a mostly plain toad Nintendo's character of choice. Odd spin off roles are in Dance Dance Revolution. A fun fact I suppose is that she was very new of a character in Paper Mario TTYD to sort of pop up like that. Until then though, she's a 2/5 I think on both visibility and playability scales.</p>

<p><b>Toadsworth:</b> A spin off character mostly, through his debut in Mario Sunshine. Frequently in RPGs, his roles are always minor in the grand scheme of things, mostly around to worry about Peach’s well being. In other spin-off games he's usually around but not playable the baseball games are just about his only playable roles. Notable in NSMB he personally ran the toad houses and his cane seemed to be a wand of some sort. This was changed in games since, making it a curious detail. (2023) There has been a dearth of him sadly. He's gone from even spin offs at this point.</p>


<p><b>Baby Mario:</b> You thought we were done talking about Mario? Nope! He started in Yoshi's Island, usually the focus of those games but strangely became a spin off roster filler starting in N64 sports games and later in Double Dash. He's here and there from that point on but since he's not just a generic character to be thrown anywhere like some here, he doesn't have as many roles outside of Yoshi games as one might think. Still, because those Yoshi games he barely makes the second level cut.</p>


<p><b>Kamek:</b> Borderline, as he is frequently in main series and spin off games his only issue is that at times Nintendo is fine with a generic blue magikoopa (and of course in Japan all magikoopas are 'Kameks'). The Yoshi’s Island franchise remains his biggest roles even though you aren't fighting him directly in those games very often. Still, as a confirmed high ranking Bowser villain who isn't (biological) family to Bowser he's notable.</p>

<HR>

		<h2>Tier three: 2 or 1/5 ratings in visibility and playability unless noted</h2>

<p><b>Birdo:</b> Has an early main role in SMB2, mostly a spin-off mainstay since. Wario's Woods was her weird puzzle phase and she's in Super Mario RPG. Sometimes included to give Yoshi a partner in sports like tennis or golf or Mario Kart. She's in some later Mario Parties like 7 as an unlockable and randomly in one Paper Mario as a cameo. Overall a side character with some rich history, kind of hard to rate but there aren't a lot of 'important' roles here. The 'are they are unique character or not' syndrome hurts the case as well.</p>

	<img src="Additionalphotos/shrooms-wiiu.png" alt="third tier">

<p><b>Blue and Yellow Toad:</b> Notable for having a decently strong if relatively recent presence in some main-series games, albeit perhaps if you have multiple controllers. <p>

<p><b>Diddy Kong:</b> A tier one from DK’s perspective, but not Mario. I didn't really realize his lack of appearances in Mario games until writing article. He didn't start appearing in Mario games until MK: Double Dash so that puts him past the 2000 mark. Then and after that just some sports games and spin offs in modern times. He was missing from Mario Party until the ninth. He has been in Smash Bros since Brawl, but we're not really counting that here.</p>

<p><b>Baddies:</b> Lakitus, Goomba, Shy Guy, Hammer Bro, Koopa, Dry Bone, Boo: Frequent generic enemies sometimes put in games as playable extras or at the least cameos. Koopa and Dry Bones get elevated because they are more likely to show in Mario Kart, Koopa even being and original racer. Dry Bones is more spotty but still common enough. Lakitu is always around just rarely playable, same for hammer bro. Shy Guy is often around but his ability to be played as is sometimes weirdly restricted like in Mario Kart DS where he's only for verses play.</p>

<p><b>King Boo:</b> Luigi's personal villain coming from Luigi's Mansion. Generally he's restricted there but can show up when you least think even in main series like Sunshine or SM64 DS. He's in Mario Kart since Double Dash but not always as playable. He can show up in Mario Parties, not playable though. Overall he's somewhat frequent as a boss in modern Mario games. I would like if he was more than depicted as a large boo in a crown, he's still cool regardless.</p>

<img src="Additionalphotos/babyluigi.png" alt="second tier">

<p><b>Baby Luigi:</b> Think Baby Mario but in distress. While he's not in the N64 games everywhere else he's where  ever his brother is. Because of you not playing as him much this makes him more minor (or more infant, get it?)</p>

<p><b>Petey Piranha:</b> A strange addition so let's talk about him! Debuted Gamecube era in Sunshine and for a while he was a semi-frequent spin off addition. He can or could rather appear in just about anything from RPGs to sports or spin-offs like Super Princess Peach or even Smash Bros. This unpredictability makes it seem like he marches to his own beat and I kind of like that.</p>

<p><b>Nabbit:</b> Yes, per Super Mario Bros. Wonder, this neither ally nor enemy made the cut. He started out as a mysterious Bowser Junior mask wearing guy in SMB:WiiU, and now in the year of our Lord 2024.. He still is, except playable in Main series stuff and even spin-offs, if as a 'easier' option to play as. 


<HR>
	<h2>Tier four</h2>

<p><b>RPG characters and bosses:</b> Fawful, and others.</p>

<p><b>Professor E. Gadd :</b> Mostly relating to Luigi’s mansion but has a few odd appearances elsewhere as a professor like some RPGs and Mario Party 6. This is not counting the references to his inventions in many more games, like confusingly (at least I always felt) Super Mario Sunshine. I will say that from an American standpoint his roles did have a pretty big gap from Partners in Time in 2005 to Luigi's Mansion Dark Moon in 2014, but he's recovered some since.</p>

<p><b>Pauline:</b>  Mario's original girlfriend before the whole Mushroom Kingdom thing. That has to be awkward. She's in Donkey Kong and logically the Gameboy remake but then made a jump after a few years in the Mario vs Donkey Kong. That's not that strange given the theme of those games, what was unexpected was Super Mario Odyssey as the mayor. Wasn't she strictly from the normal world? Oh well. Since she's playable in Mario Tennis Aces and a few others but as a rule she's usually a cameo and not a character to play.</p>

<p><b>Metal Mario:</b> Why are we reviewing a power up? Silly you, this is a completely original character according to Nintendo. Smash Bros first made him be a mini boss and games like Mario Golf has him unlockable along with some other sports titles. He's a boss in Dr. Mario 64 and a clone option in later Mario Karts starting with 7. Not much more to say aside from the fact that he can't say 'mama mia' correctly and he's constantly underwater by the sounds of it. Overall he's a strict utility character, as in you get to use a power character with the frame of a normal one. That's great and all, but did it have to be a copy of our Mario to do that? Be aware that that's not why he's ranked so low, this isn't about my opinions after all, he just has a game track record you can count on your fingers.</p>
