<H1>Mario Character Tier List (Under Construction)</H1>

<p>The concept of tier lists should be familiar to most gamers. A character or item or load-out or etc, ranks above others due to the fact that no game can be perfectly balanced and so players wanting to gain and edge will flock to them. Anything remotely competitive will often hinge on this, but of course there’s always the argument that skill prevails as many would agree also. This article isn’t really about something with a competitive edge at all, rather the way Nintendo treats some of their star characters and their popularity. This will be determined by who Nintendo includes in Mario games. The distinction between ‘main series’ and ‘spin-off’ games will be huge here and is actually one of prime determining factors. Since I’ll try to be objective this isn’t labeled as an opinion piece article. Also as I continue to analyze various games (it’s not as simple as it seems) this list and my ratings may be subject to change over time.</p>

<p>Main series: The Super Mario Bros franchise and other main Mario games like Super Mario 64. Playable characters here will be Mario and maybe Luigi with plots centering around Peach and Bowser. Yoshi is semi-frequent but him being playable (ie rideable) is a toss up and usually limited.</p>

<p>Spin-off games: Mario Kart, Mario Party, Mario sports, RPGs, and others. Here is where it becomes an interesting free for all.</p>


<p>Highest Rank:</p>

<p>Mario: Mario is always the central and playable character except in a few spin-offs like Luigi’s Mansion for example. His spot as the top character doesn’t need to be explained much so let’s just move on. Characterization is consistent with all games.</p>

<p>Visibility: 5/5</p>
<p>Playability: 5/5</p>

<p>Peach: Princess of the Mushroom Kingdom debuting in Super Mario Bros. 1. She is almost always the center of the conflict but being playable in a main-series game is an uncommon treat, justified because she’s busy being kidnapped and all and can’t be in two places as once. Characterization is often not much because she’s off in another castle or normalish but concerning and often calling for Mario’s help. RPGs often her a little more justice. Of course SMB2 was an early exception to this with her but status quo kind of remains to this day outside of exceptions like Super Mario 3D World or Super Mario Run. Funny thing about New Super Mario Bros U, they got around that pesky issue by having Toadette use a power up to become Peach. Now Spin off game wise she’s a frequent and has been for some years but of course her pretty face isn’t in everything. Most RPGs don’t have her playable but she’s nearly in everything else. A thing to note is that she is of course a Smash brother as a full character from Melee onward.

V: 5/5
P: 1/5 main 4.5/5 spin</p>



<p>Bowser: Bowser is the series villain and responsible for most conflicts so justifiably he’s going to be very visible but not very playable. After all, we haven’t gotten our staring ‘be a bad guy’ game yet despite what some fans might want. Characterization varies between cruel and mean but normal or comic relief and goofy. In spin off games except most of the Mario Party games he fares better but not as good as you might think. I won’t list everything but I’ll break it down some. You can play him in all Mario Karts but not Mario Party unless it’s Super Mario Party or Mario Party 10. The RPG’s are normally not it unless it’s Super Mario RPG, Bowser’s Inside Story, and Super Paper Mario. Mario Tennis and Golf are normally good for him but not puzzle games. He is a Smash character as of Melee.

V: 5/5
P: 1/5 main 4/5 spin</p>

<p>Luigi : This Mario brother is typically around where ever his brother is. Characterization varies between little or a sort of silly wacky sibling of Mario. In a lot of the 2D platform games even some modern ones, he’s a player two option only. If you are a single player you might not be able to play as him without a second controller. Lost Levels is an early twist to that, giving Luigi his own ‘mode’ and other features. His 3D game track record can also be spotty for some reason. Super Mario 64 or Sunshine famously omit him completely while games like Super Mario Galaxy make him annoyingly an end of game unlock. His spin off track record is more respectable and he’s playable in games where others aren’t like NES Open Tournament golf. A bright spot is that he’s been in Smash Bros since the original. More things to note, his RPG record is better than others because he’s in the Mario and Luigi games. While not usually central to the plot in Paper Mario he is always visible to the point where some of these games have him cameo for no reason really. Luigi has his staring roles too. 

V: 4.5/5
P: 4/5 main 5/5 spin</p>

<p>Yes, his spin off score is higher than main series. This is just because of the 3D game issue.</p>

<p>Yoshi: Yoshi is frequent more than one might think as a regular and supporting character. Characterization is not always consistent in how much of an animal or not he is. Sometimes he can talk normally, other times not, but he’s always cheerful and loyal. Let’s start with spin offs this time. Yoshi has an unsuspecting presence in puzzle games like Yoshi, Yoshi’s Cookie, and Tetris Attack. His Yoshi’s Island franchise is also extensive and there’s other things like Yoshi’s Safari and he has a role in educational games. Mario Party, Kart, and sports are sure to always feature him. Moving on to main series he’s more of a power up than playable character. Each game is restrictive in some way, even Super Mario World doesn’t let him enter some levels and later games like New Super Mario Bros restrict him to single levels. 3D games have him either as a cameo or someone to briefly be/use again with major restrictions. RPG’s are okay for him but cameo wise only and Paper Mario can be a little weird for him with no direct appearance. (There ARE yoshis in Paper Mario but..) 

V: 4/5
P: 3/5 main 4/5 spin</p>

<p>Toad: To start off it’s important to remember that ‘Toad’ isn’t really a single character. Toads are ubiquitous in games, normally docile but cowardly which is probably why Buckenberry and Ala-Gold  (Blue and yellow toad from NSMB games) were created to give different looking toads a heroic roll. Captain Toad is also an exception but he is NOT the same character as ‘Toad’, although the canonical Toad IS supposedly in Super Mario 3D World appearing blue as nod to SMB2. (Citation: Mario Wiki: Blue Toad) Back to the analysis, Toad had a break out in SMB2 and the New Super Mario Bros again but that’s about it. Spin off wise Wario’s Wood’s is a notable early role. Toad was especially in older games reserved as a host so he’s not playable in some Mario Party and Sports games. RPGs will heavily feature toads as a species a lot but not playable. Overall the ability to play as him in spin offs is mostly a modern thing. He’s not a smash brother but fake rumors have been around since Melee so there’s that.

V: 4.5/5
P: 1.5/5 main, 3/5 spin</p>


<p>Wario:  This guy started out in a Super Mario Land game then very quickly got his own franchise distinct from Mario. He is simply not a main series character but on the spin off side of things he became common as a token sort of bad guy along with maybe Bowser in games like Mario Party and the sports. He’s in Mario Kart consistently from 64 onward. Characterization is very consistent, not that his character hasn’t evolved a bit but from his first solo game it’s pretty close. He’s been in smash brothers since Brawl but is completely absent in RPGs.

V: 3/5
P: 1/5 main, 3/5 spin</p>



<p>DK: Donkey Kong is a cross-over character with is his own distinct franchise. He doesn’t appear a lot in main-series games but because of his historical history with Mario and presence in spin offs he belongs on the list. He was a Mario Party mainstay until halfway through the series thought his playable status came back. In Mario sports he’s often in later games but in a few early games Donkey Kong Junior would actually be there in his place. Of course when you think about it Junior IS DK so.. Anyway, he’s a Smash Bros veteran. He has a few other points of interests, like the Mario vs Donkey Kong games, and the precursor Donkey Kong for Gameboy. Characterization would be helpful but brawny. After all, he thinks he can take on Bowser in some Mario Parties. In other games where he’s a good counterpart to Bowser he literally can, so that’s cool.

V: 2/5
P: 1/5 main, 3.5/5 spin</p>

<p>Why is his score lower than Yoshi? A lot of yoshi games are still ‘Mario’ games while Donkey Kong game are completely removed.</p>

<p>Rosalina: Much newer than others but worth considering. Her character debuts from the main series Mario Galaxy franchise. From that point she has respectable appearances in spin offs and even some unexpected games. She is playable in 3D World as an action princess. She’s in Mario Kart since Wii and Smash Bros since 4. The fact that she has statically less time to show up in games does skew the score a little but I attempted to make one anyway.

V: 1/5
P: 1/5 main, 2/5 spin.</p>

<p>Bowser Junior: Main stay despite being a relatively new addition compared to others, well, if 2001 is new. As a pretty major character he replaced the Koopalings completely for a while but now exists along side them. He’s actually very likely to show up in main series games 2D or 3D which is unique. He is usually found being a pretty easy miniboss in games. His spin off count is respectable. He’s in Mario Kart since Double Dash!!, Tennis since Power Tennis, and the later Mario Parties as a replacement of the depreciated Koopa Kids. Paper Mario brought him on in Sticker Star and later Mario & Luigi games. Smash Bros brought him on since 4. His personality is what would be expected of a koopa brat. Usually the toys he deals with, Koopa Clown Cars and etc, says more than himself.

V: 3.4/5
P: 1/5 main, 3.5/5 spin.</p>

<h2>Not Tier 1</h2>

<p>Daisy: Princess of Sarasaland and famous for a main roll in an oft forgotten game to become a spin off mainstay from N64 era onward. </p>

<p>Koopalings: At least now they aren’t. Very borderline. In the NES and SNES era they were unquestionably main villains with Bowser, however their almost complete disappearance from N64 to Wii era hurt things. Now though, they have had sudden revival in a few main series games and several spin-offs.</p>

<p>Diddy Kong: A tier one from DK’s perspective, but nowhere else. Somewhat frequent spin off appearances, but only since the GameCube era, giving him a disadvantage compared to most. Also like, zero main series appearances I believe.</p>

<p>Waluigi: The same story as Daisy only he has never had a main roll at all. The fact that Nintendo keeps him away from Wario games is also very telling that the relationship is artificially crafted for sports games.</p>

<p>Birdo: Has an early main roll in SMB2, mostly a spin-off mainstay since. Sometimes included to give Yoshi a partner.</p>

<p>Toadette: Debuted later than some of the others, first in MK:DD but since appears here and there. Got a go in a main series game in NSMB WiiU deluxe and a few others.</p>

<p>Toadsworth: A spin off character mostly. Main series rolls are always very minor in the grand scheme of things, and even in spin offs he mostly is around to worry about Peach’s well being.</p>

<p>RPG characters and bosses: Fawful, and others.</p>

<p>Kamek: Borderline, but definitely on the not tier 1 side. Has lots of appearances though, but not quite enough to be truly top material. Part of the issue is that a lot of time generic Magikoopas are used instead of Kamek while looking identical to him, and Yoshi’s Island remains his biggest most notable roll.</p>

<p>Petey Piranha: A strange addition. Debuted Gamecube era and for a while he was a semi-frequent spin off additon. Similar to Toadette, only a bit worse off in that Wii era and onward appearances are rare.</p>

<p>Professor E. Gadd : Spin off. Mostly relating to Luigi’s mansion but has a few odd appearances elsewhere as a professor.</p>
