		<H1>Mario Oddities: Smorgasbord (Under Construction)</H1>
			<p>Enjoy a collection of Mario Oddity articles of mine, some old some new, that are small enough to be on one web page. Updated regularly! Enjoy.</p>
			
			
		<H2>Yoshi's Safari</H2>
		
			<p>Yoshi games (that aren’t Yoshi’s Island) sort of get the short end of the stick when it comes memorable Mario games. They attempt weird things and just get of forgotten so this article will be based on Yoshi’s Safari (also know as Yoshi’s Road Hunting in Japan). Released in 1993 for the SNES, it’s an on rails shooter where you ride Yoshi through Jewelry Land on a quest to assist King Fret and Prince Pine. You get to unleash a fury of super scope pellets on goombas, koopas, and even Koopalings in locations that look suspiciously like Super Mario World but aren’t! Already things are a little different for Mario. Our heroic plumber is only really involved because Peach is friends with the prince. We also have locations unlike other games. The enemy selection is nice and things get creative with the mechas some enemies and koopalings are armed with. Split between the Light and Dark Realm, the game goes along steadily with a map screen for each and colorful graphics. There is some platforming, where you must jump over something and sometimes there are branching paths within levels. When you finally face Bowser he’s huge, predating that trope in later games’ and armored. This game is hardcore!</p>
			
			<p>Realistically this game is a little inconvenient to play if you insist on doing it authentically, since super scopes cost more than the games and are fiddly. Emulation works well in this case, and the game is truly worth checking out as a light duty, not too hard light gun game and the only of it’s kind for Mario. For some trivia, this is actually the first game where Peach is called Peach in America, not Super Mario 64 as commonly credited. </p>
		
		
		
		<H2>Mario's Punch</H2>
		
			<p>The most mundane Mario Oddity so far, yet the one that goes back the farthest in my life. Since I was a child I thought it was strange that Super Mario 64 and its remake are the only games where Mario can punch. Remember that Mario 64 had a huge moveset to accompany Mario in a new and exciting 3D world, from punching to kicking to ground pounding to wall jumping. Some of those moves prominently moved on, the ground pound, the triple jump mechanics, long jumping, and wall jumping, but distinctly not Mario’s one-two-three punch kick combo. Why?</p>
			
			<p>Super Mario Sunshine gave Mario FLUDD as the new gimmick. It is often activated with the shoulder buttons, freeing up the normal buttons. What are they used for in Sunshine? ‘A’ button is jump related and ‘B’ is for picking things up and a few other actions, not offensively however. Why did they leave that move out? Mario’s jumping is altered too to account for FLUDD, so perhaps  Mario having  too many attacks would distract from our buddy from Prof. E. Gadd? </p>
			
			<p>Super Mario Galaxy replaces “punch” with a “spin” as an offensive move and one that extends jumping range. Of note is that this is a power a luma gives Mario and not an innate ability. Super Mario Odyssey has a similar thing, you throw the cap as a combo offensive and other function move and again this ability is granted by a secondary character. Why no punching those those cases? Again likely to make room for other moves. Because Super Mario 64 has no gimmick beyond Mario being in a 3D space, that move and others had a place. In each game after there is something else to focus on, and let’s not kid ourselves. What’s more iconic for Mario? Jumping around or imitating Mike Tyson?</p>
