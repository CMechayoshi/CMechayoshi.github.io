		<H1>Paper Mario Sticker Star: Dark elements (Under Construction)</H1>

<p>Based off an older blog post of mine, here is something short and sweet.</p>

<p>1. When you use a fire based sticker on an enemy, they turn to ashes and blow away.. This is because PM:SS takes the paper aspect more literally than other games where it’s more aesthetic but it’s still out of place and dark.</p> 

			

<p>2. After you defeat Kamek for the last time he seems to loose his mind a bit and DIES. The game doesn’t acknowledge this at all…</p>

<p>3. The Mr. Blizzard boss isn’t even evil, he just want to not melt but you kill him. The game tries to make it bittersweet, see below. He'll say something like 'you'll build me again next year' but obviously that's just to cover the murder attempt. Don't be fooled!</p>

"Spring came and snow started to melt
My body got uncomfortably svelte
I lamented the frail bod I was dealt
A sticker knew my wish was heartfelt"
- Mizzter Blizzard's poem

<p>4. Wiggler’s body is torn apart, but the game treats this like a joke. The body parts are even sentient and can write diary entries. (In fact failure to notice this inconceivable ability could make you permanently lose an entry.) Uh, more weird and gross than dark or disturbing I'm still going to give a trigger warning for the childish image below.</p>

<p>5. During the Snifit or Whiffit game show, they are literally trying to kill you. Completely debased comedy! They are bad guys though so that’s justified but you’re still on a literally deadly gameshow.</p>

<p>6. Most disturbing of all… Mario can’t use anything, not even his own boots without stickers!!!!!!!!! The horrror!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
