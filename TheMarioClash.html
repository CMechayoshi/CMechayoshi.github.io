	<h2>BooTracker 2000 (2015)</h2>
		
			<img src="images/halloween.png" alt="BooTracker 2000 album art">
			
			<p>The first album, actually a collection of all songs created at the time with no overall theme or anything. The cover image labeled ‘halloween’ (has nothing to actually do with the holiday) is from 10/31/11. It became this albums cover because it was simply on hand and I made it a running theme for all subsequent albums. There are two song listings, the official alphabetical one listed on Soundcloud in 2016 with only a few of the songs.</p>
			
			<p>Full listing:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Bass Colony
				<li>Bass Exploration
				<li>BooMaster Theme
				<li>Cosmos
				<li>Enemy Mime
				<li>Enemy mime of the opera
				<li>The energy that flows through us (demo)
				<li>Friendemies*
				<li>Happy Day
				<li>Happy Day (extended)
				<li>Jazz Experiment
				<li>Old meets new
				<li>Old strikes again
				<li>Synth (space)
				<li>Techno loop 1
				<li>Techno loop 1  remix
				<li>Watch for piranhas
			</ol>	
				
			<p>*Misspell</p>	
			<p>Alternate 2016 Soundcloud listing:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Bass Exploration
				<li>Old meets New
				<li>Bass colony
				<li>Happy Day (extended)
				<li>Synth (space)
				<li>Jazz experiment
				<li>Happy Day
				<li>Old strikes again
				<li>Enemy Mime of the opera
				<li>Friendemies*
			</ol>
		
		<p>-Notes: Techno loop 1 and Jazz experiment were the first and second songs made respectively. Bass colony, Bass exploration, and Cosmos are meant to be a series. The two ‘Enemy mimes’ are not related but ‘Opera’ does sample Boss colony/exploration’s bass line. ‘The energy’ was always unfinished. ‘Roomcleaner’ from BooTracker 3000 was created in this era but not uploaded until later. Old meets new And Old strikes again are the first two parts of a concept where vintage and modern meet. Technoloop 1 remix was the first of many remixes.</p>

	
	<h2>BooTracker Remixes (2016, 2017)</h2>
			<img src="images/remixes.JPG" alt="Bootracker remixes">
			
		<p>Three songs from the previous remade and with new album art created.</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li> Enemy Mime (of the Opera) v.2
			<li> Happy day extended v.2
			<li>Techno loop 1 Remix v.2
		</ol>
		
		<p>-Notes: This is a collection rather than a true release as all songs were released separately as singles. Enemy mime is from 2017 and has the biggest change from original with a new section added. Happy day speeds up and changes instruments only. Techno loop is a gentle tweak to make the original less chaotic. </p>
		
	<h2>Bass Collection</h2>
			<img src="images/21823899625_e7ae89476c_o.jpg" alt="Bass Collection art">
	
		<p>Just a real release just album art created as shown above but no new songs, just a re-release of the three songs of the BooTracker 2000’s bass series put in a playlist on Soundcloud.</p>

	<h2>BooTracker 2001 (2016)</h2>
		<p>Amia's first intentional and kind of serious (mostly, we'll get to that) album using collage like art made up of a couple of concept images put together. There are two listings but the Soundcloud version omits songs because it was early. Below is the final.</p>
	
			<img src="images/21797901196_b99f948f58_o.png" alt="BooTracker 2001">
			
		<ol>
			<li>Bass exploration (remix)
			<li>BM Theme (live, slow)
			<li>BooMaster Theme v.2 Demo
			<li>Frenemies (Interlude)
			<li>Jazz experiment 1.5
			<li>New Strikes Again
			<li>Synth (space) v.2
			<li>Synth (Industrial)
		</ol>

	
		<p>Notes: Like said before this was a progression of old and new ideas. Four songs are some sor of remake or remix in realtion to BooTracker 2000. Going song by song, Bass exploration remixes the song from BooTracker 2000. We get our first rleased live songs on an album with BM (BooMaster) theme live slow. This was double tracked with guitar and bass. BooMaster Theme v.2 Demo however is totally digital. Jazz experiemnt 1.5 is named as such because it chops up the orginal. Frenemies is spelt correctly now and is based off the chords of the original. Synth space chances intrumments and cleans up the song a little though some errors couldn't be fixed. New Strikes Again is the last in the 'Old meets New' concept. Synth Industrial is an original.</p>


	<h2>BooTracker 3000 (2016, 2017)</h2>
		<p>Takes a different direction with emphasis on live music and original songs. This was the last material created with the original iPad before it was stolen and the files for this album and the ones before this lost forever. There are two listings with minimal differences. This is also the first and only album to have Amia Moore's name on the cover.</p>
