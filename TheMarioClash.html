	<h2>BooTracker 2000 (2015)</h2>
		
			<img src="images/halloween.png" alt="BooTracker 2000 album art">
			
			<p>The first ‘album though it is really just a collection of all songs created at the time with no overall theme or anything. The cover image labeled ‘halloween’ (has nothing to actually do with the holiday) is from 10/31/11. It became so because it was simply on hand and became a running theme for all subsequent albums. There are two song listings, the official alphabetical one listed on Soundcloud in 2016 with only a few of the songs.</p>
			
			<p>Full listing:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Bass Colony
				<li>Bass Exploration
				<li>BooMaster Theme
				<li>Cosmos
				<li>Enemy Mime
				<li>Enemy mime of the opera
				<li>The energy that flows through us (demo)
				<li>Friendemies*
				<li>Happy Day
				<li>Happy Day (extended)
				<li>Jazz Experiment
				<li>Old meets new
				<li>Old strikes again
				<li>Synth (space)
				<li>Techno loop 1
				<li>Techno loop 1  remix
				<li>Watch for piranhas
			</ol>	
				
			<p>*Misspell</p>	
			<p>Alternate 2016 Soundcloud listing:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Bass Exploration
				<li>Old meets New
				<li>Bass colony
				<li>Happy Day (extended)
				<li>Synth (space)
				<li>Jazz experiment
				<li>Happy Day
				<li>Old strikes again
				<li>Enemy Mime of the opera
				<li>Friendemies*
			</ol>
		
		<p>-Notes: Techno loop 1 and Jazz experiment were the first and second songs made respectively. Bass colony, Bass exploration, and Cosmos are meant to be a series. The two ‘Enemy mimes’ are not related but ‘Opera’ does sample Boss colony/exploration’s bass line. ‘The energy’ was always unfinished. ‘Roomcleaner’ from BooTracker 3000 was created in this era but not uploaded until later. Old meets new And Old strikes again are the first two parts of a concept where vintage and modern meet. Technoloop 1 remix was the first of many remixes.</p>

	
	<h2>BooTracker Remixes (2016, 2017)</h2>
			<img src="images/remixes.jpg" alt="Bootracker remixes">
			
		<p>Three songs from the previous remade and with new album art  created.</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li> Enemy Mime (of the Opera) v.2
			<li> Happy day extended v.2
			<li>Techno loop 1 Remix v.2
		</ol>
		
		<p>-Notes: This is a collection rather than a true release as all songs were released separately as singles. Enemy mime is from 2017 and has the biggest change from original with a new section added. Happy day speeds up and changes instruments only. Techno loop is a gentle tweak to make the original less chaotic. </p>
		
	<h2>Bass Collection:</h2>
			<img src="images/21823899625_e7ae89476c_o.jpg" alt="Bass Collection art">
	
		<p>Just a real release just album art created as shown above but no new songs, just a re-release of the three songs of the BooTracker 2000’s bass series put in a playlist on Soundcloud.</p>

	<h2>BooTracker 2001</h2>

	
		<p>Amia's first 'intended' album using what was learnt during the creation of BooTracker 2000.</p>
