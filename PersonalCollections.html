<h3>Mario and Bowser: Frenemies Forever Redux 2019 version:</h3>

	<img src="images/Mario_and_Bowser_FF2.png" alt="Mario and Bowser FF2">

<p>-Here is the removed version. Be aware I edited and improved the story all during 2020 and 2021, up to very early 2022 when I realized I'd grown as a writer it was best to stop patch working and start fresh. I had  different perspective anyway. That's the live ongoing version you will see online now. (See Works Tab) Normally I do not remove works of mine off the internet, but this was a rare instance where keeping this up would detract from the new one and/or confuse someone possibly.</p> 

<p><em>Fun fact: I recently rediscovered even older versions of the chapters below. Some paint a different story at moments. Though the latest edits, or better yet the new 2022- Redux is better, if you are curious <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SITRKjcGwxR7w_Bo49nvNYoHE-yvugCY?usp=sharing">click here</a> for a folder with all the oldest chapters.</em></p>

<h3>Peach the Punk Princess:</h3>

	<img src="Additionalphotos/peach.jpg" alt="Peach punk">
	<p style="text-align:center"><em>Too bad the cover doesn't show her punk getup</em></p>

		<p>-This story has a simple AU ideal. 'What if Peach was Punk?'. The development was long, staring mid 2017 and finishing early 2019, but there was a lot of passion behind it, because I'm into music. My project 'The Mario Clash' came from this story for instance. It's a short but wild trip for Peach with a few references to other works of mine.</p> 

		<p><em>Summary: What if Peach was Punk? How would her friends and family react? Loosely inspired by Super Mario Bros Comic: Magic Carpet Madness.</em> (Note, not really based on that comic at all aside from how peach looks on the cover.)</p>

<h3>Monster Mix-Up</h3>

	<img src="images/art1ndsmariokart.jpg" alt="Frog Mario kart">
	<p style="text-align:center"><em>Doesn't perfectly match but close enough..</em></p>


	<p><em>Summary: Based off of the Nintendo Adventure Book, Bowser is making mega-monsters and its up to Mario and friends to stop him!</em> Long before creating my Nintendo Adventure Books guides, I did a pseudo version of that with this early fan-fiction. It's a novelization primarily of the infamous to my childhood Book #3 Monster Mixup, but since I have Mario make all of the correct choices, and in later chapters have author notes telling you what's up, it functions as a walkthrough too.</p> 
	
	<p>Other fun facts, this was the only story I started in 2016, the year I began to upload to FF.net and completed in that same year. Others would have to get their conclusion in 2017 or later, including Frenemies Forever org. I made a bizarre remix there here. <em>Summary: A corruption of the Nintendo Adventure Book and Pokemon Vietnamese Crystal. Bowser is making mega monsters...in bootleg zone!</em></p>

<h3>A Wolf in Mario's Clothing</h3>

	<img src="PaperImages/PMvsSS2.jpg" alt="FAKE PAPER MARIO">
	<p style="text-align:center"><em>What? You thought this was a Paper Mario game? Psyche!</em></p>

		<p><em>Summary: Based off of Paper Mario: TTYD. Doopliss steals Mario's identity and has some fun. He's gonna be one 'Super' Mario...(Previously named 'A Freak in Mario's Clothing')</em> Okay, the images are getting less and less related I know, but this was a cool ideal I hadn't seen anyone do then or now. It's based on the short stunt of Doopliss copying Mario and that's it. Now it's for sure and old story, and there's a few self admitted errors, see author notes, but it's cool over all. I was proud of it, and it features characters I don't usually write, because I don't usually novelize games.</p>
