<h3>Mario and Bowser: Frenemies Forever Redux 2019 version:</h3>

	<img src="images/Mario_and_Bowser_FF2.png" alt="Mario and Bowser FF2">

<p>-Here is the removed version. Be aware I edited and improved the story all during 2020 and 2021, up to very early 2022 when I realized I'd grown as a writer it was best to stop patch working and start fresh. I had  different perspective anyway. That's the live ongoing version you will see online now. (See Works Tab) Normally I do not remove works of mine off the internet, but this was a rare instance where keeping this up would detract from the new one and/or confuse someone possibly.</p> 

<p><em>Fun fact: I recently rediscovered even older versions of the chapters below. Some paint a different story at moments. Though the latest edits, or better yet the new 2022- Redux is better, if you are curious <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SITRKjcGwxR7w_Bo49nvNYoHE-yvugCY?usp=sharing">click here</a> for a folder with all the oldest chapters.</em></p>

<h3>Peach the Punk Princess:</h3>

	<img src="Additionalphotos/peach.jpg" alt="Peach punk">
	<p style="text-align:center"><em>Too bad the cover doesn't show her punk getup</em></p>

		<p>-This story has a simple AU ideal. 'What if Peach was Punk?'. The development was long, staring mid 2017 and finishing early 2019, but there was a lot of passion behind it, because I'm into music. My project 'The Mario Clash' came from this story for instance. It's a short but wild trip for Peach with a few references to other works of mine.</p> 

		<p><em>Summary: What if Peach was Punk? How would her friends and family react? Loosely inspired by Super Mario Bros Comic: Magic Carpet Madness.</em> (Note, not really based on that comic at all aside from how peach looks on the cover.)</p>

<h3>Monster Mix-Up</h3>

	<img src="images/art1ndsmariokart.jpg" alt="Frog Mario kart">
	<p style="text-align:center"><em>Doesn't perfectly match but close enough..</em></p>


	<p><em>Summary: Based off of the Nintendo Adventure Book, Bowser is making mega-monsters and its up to Mario and friends to stop him!</em> Long before creating my Nintendo Adventure Books guides, I did a pseudo version of that with this early fan-fiction. It's a novelization primarily of the infamous to my childhood Book #3 Monster Mixup, but since I have Mario make all of the correct choices, and in later chapters have author notes telling you what's up, it functions as a walkthrough too.</p> 
	
	<p>Other fun facts, this was the only story I started in 2016, the year I began to upload to FF.net and completed in that same year. Others would have to get their conclusion in 2017 or later, including Frenemies Forever org. I made a bizarre remix there here. <em>Summary: A corruption of the Nintendo Adventure Book and Pokemon Vietnamese Crystal. Bowser is making mega monsters...in bootleg zone!</em></p>

<h3>A Wolf in Mario's Clothing</h3>

	<img src="PaperImages/PMvsSS2.jpg" alt="FAKE PAPER MARIO">
	<p style="text-align:center"><em>What? You thought this was a Paper Mario game? Psyche!</em></p>

		<p><em>Summary: Based off of Paper Mario: TTYD. Doopliss steals Mario's identity and has some fun. He's gonna be one 'Super' Mario...(Previously named 'A Freak in Mario's Clothing')</em> Okay, the images are getting less and less related I know, but this was a cool ideal I hadn't seen anyone do then or now. It's based on the short stunt of Doopliss copying Mario and that's it. Now it's for sure and old story, and there's a few self admitted errors, see author notes, but it's cool over all. I was proud of it, and it features characters I don't usually write, because I don't usually novelize games.</p>

	<h3>Chemistry</h3>	
		<img src="PaperImages/sluggers.jpg" alt="Many characters">
	<p style="text-align:center"><em>That moment when you create a baseball team and ten percent (maybe more depending on Diddy, Dixie, and Tiny) aren't of legal drinking age..</em></p>

	<p><em>Summary: In the world of Mario, why does THIS character and THAT character hate each other? A series of snarky fandom and meta commentary on silly roster choices and/or rivalries, memes, and more in the Mario universe. Starring: Everyone!… eventually...just give it time!</em> A truly fringe ideal of mine. Not my best work, or my most nuanced, or the only I'd make with a meta subtext, but boy was I snarky about stuff, and it resulted in one of my few purely comedy stories. The A03 is used for the html document since it shows the unique formatting I attempt here. The last line in the summary was supposed to be a reference to Magikoopa981's 'Nuclear Phantasy'. 
	</p>
	
	<p>We start basing on Super Mario Baseball, thus the title. Soon this devolves into a spat over baby characters in Mario Kart games and then somehow Bowsette, plus other memes. Like a few other stories of mine, this is vaguely in the Frenemies Forever universe, featuring some of the OCs. A few more stories below would do the same. Some draft versions of the first chapter were posted on my tumblr back in the day, but no reason to link those. It's not that interesting.</p>

	<h3>Mr. Game & Watch Does a Thing</h3>	
		<img src="PaperImages/mrgw.jpg" alt="Many characters">
	<p style="text-align:center"><em>Pictured: One thing he's not allowed to do these days.</em></p>

	<p><em>Summary: Every Smash bros fanfiction in one story. Also Mr. G&W will do a thing, of course. Inspired by: Yoshizilla of course. Plus a few other fanfics I've read. Can you spot the references?</em> This one, like Chemistry is tied topically to a certain era, even more meta in a way because I'm playing with tropes and setups of popular Smash Brothers fan fictions in this story. While the short quirky style is a ref to Yoshizilla Rhedosaurus (who favorited this and noticed Senpai!), another big one was Smash Brothers on Facebook, Hot Topic, and other meme stories, plus some very early Frenemies Forever stuff tossed in with OCs. I write in general a couple of characters you'll never see in other works of mine, as they aren't Mario ones. As this is purely in 2017, it's super sophomoric and never meant to be taken too seriously, so enjoy. -Unfinished unfortunately.

	<p><em>Summary: One innocent Monday Mario and friends realize they now possess a new 'gift'- All except for one of them. How does his world cope when secrets can be no more?</em> Based on a writing prompt and part of a series of Mario stories I was doing in 2018. Soon to be added here, they consisted of ideals I'd never seen in a story. Here Mario and co try to live their lives, again in a world vaguely from Frenemies Forever, except they can read each other's mind. Well, almost all of them, leading to the twists and turns in store. Besides being a one shot, very atypical for me, its a Marioish save the princess plot, another thing I don't like to do normally. This never gained a ton of attention but liked the ideal and execution, and this was actually written out on paper before digital upload. I speak about it in author notes. -One shot.

	<p style="text-align:center"><em>THIS GUY! THIS GUY RIGHT HERE!... Oh this isn't Youtube? I don't have to point?...</em></p>
	
	
	<p><em>Summary: Goombas were the last to join Bowser's army. (Fact) This however isn't. (Maybe)</em> Part of my 'experimental prompt' series sorta for 2018, this one-shot is based on the fact that goombas were the last enemy programmed for Super Mario Bros 1. Why? Koopa Troopas were thought to be a little too advanced for a brand new player, so the goombas that greet you first in this famous game were the last! Irony! This also creates, as I touch on in story, the narrative that the goombas were once with the Mushroom Kingdom but rebelled, an angle actual games after SMB1 don't touch on ever. Enjoy this short little story.</p>

		<h3>Toad in the Whoa Zone</h3>	

<img src="PaperImages/paper-mario.jpg" alt="1-1 Goomba">
	<p style="text-align:center"><em>Story events are far far stranger than whatever's going on here..</em></p>

	<p><em>Summary: Can Toad keep his head straight as he discovers new and weird alternate universes?</em> A very odd one of mine and one of the longest lasting stories, created late 2016 and actually completed early 2019. And yet it's only four chapters! Firstly, not this isn't based on Super Paper Mario. It might have went there at some point, but like many early stories this was seat of pants. What's a little unique is that I referenced this not once, but twice in the original Frenemies Forever (And Monster Mix up too in those). The short tale we have is surprisingly written well beyond the first chapter of antics and chatter, plus I find it funny, even though this was more about me being experimental and provocative than 'comedic' (compared to Chemistry for instance). Enjoy something different.<p>
