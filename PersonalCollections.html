<h3>Mario and Bowser: Frenemies Forever 2/Redux (2019 version):</h3>

	<img src="images/Mario_and_Bowser_FF2.png" alt="Mario and Bowser FF2" style="width:200px">

<p>-Here is what I refer to now as 'FF2', the only fic I've taken down from my profiles online. Be aware I edited and improved the story all during 2020 and 2021, up to very early 2022 when I started fresh and created what is now referred to as 'Redux', or sometimes Redux 2022. (See My Works Tab) Normally I do not operate that way, but this was a rare instance where keeping both up would confuse some or detract from what I think is the better later version. Note: Sorry for small formatting errors</p>

<p><em>Fun fact: I recently rediscovered even older versions of the chapters below. Some paint a different story at moments. Though the latest edits, or better yet the new 2022- Redux is better, if you are curious <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SITRKjcGwxR7w_Bo49nvNYoHE-yvugCY?usp=sharing">click here</a> for a folder with all the oldest chapters.</em></p>

<h2>C. Mechayoshi's Fan-fic B-sides</h2>


<a id="fanfic">

<p>Extra works with ideals that never went far enough to garner a strong identity.<p>

	<ul>
		<li>Cosmic Mario's A Douche: No one likes this guy, including Mario and friends. Probably because he's a dangerous psychopath, but who knows? (Short stories)
		<li>Spooky Speedster's Quest for 'it': The Spooky Speedster is always on the quest for "it" and never gotten over losing "it" from Mario. But he's "never never gonna get it!" He will annoy his next door neighbor Luigi in the meantime though. (Short stories) [Note: I'm why this character has a category on FF.net]
		<li> Return Customer: Mario and friends are ever eager to Bowser to star heaven after his plans fail. It's Rosalina's job to send him back, but not before a little chat. Request from: Barbacar. 
		<li>Weird and Rude Conversation: (AU) Bowserman is an entertainer and Bowser impersonator. Flare the podoboo is a plumber. What will happen when they are put in a room together? -Well, along with with a bit of "help" from a Boo, of course. (Contains OCs)

<h3> Lemmy's Land.. tribute.. thing..</h3>

<p>This was a Mario fan site thriving in the early 00s when I found it. Like how many others feel, it was super fun to waste time there reading the fan-fiction (or fun fiction and scribbles as was their terminology), play games, look at the art, checkout the contests, reviews, even dip into the forums. I was 'super_stanly' there, a reference to Stanley the Bugman. I was aware of that character due to the Neglected Mario Character sprite comics, but that's another tale for another day. The review section validated my hate at the time of Super Mario Sunshine, yes I thought it was overrated way back when compared to Mario 64 and thought I was the only one with issues with it. I also tried to mess around on the forums, caused some hoopla somehow with something I can't remember saying, and gave up there, going to Nintendoland instead. Let's not talk about that either!</p>

<p>Unfortunately this was years before I started to submit fan-fiction online so I am memorialized there only with four little submissions. Was I destined a reviewer, complete with the shilling and scandals? Thankfully not to be honest, but here they are anyway, neat little look into by perspectives back when I was starting to get into collecting retro games. Webmaster 'Lemmy' would personally email you and give pointers, as he commented on my improvement in submissions. I still have some of his correspondence printed out. Dated 5/1/ 2009 that means I was quite illiterate as a teen! Actually my typing proficiency was lacking and I would get lazy. With slow internet until the next year, I couldn't participate much online and had little incentive to type often. I fixed that quickly. Anyway, check it out!</p>
