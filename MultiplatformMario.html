		<H2>Yoshi's Cookie: NES, Gameboy, SNES </h2>
				<p>This is a puzzle game from 1992 initially. Match the same types of cookies to clear a line. There are a bunch of rounds for single player and a two
				player mode. Puzzle mode is only in the SNES version where you are given limited moves to clear the stage. Find the manual <a href="https://themushroomkingdom.net/manuals/yc-nes.txt">here.</a><p>

				<p>Interesting notes of this game is that the SNES version which came out in 1993 has a more uptodate and less Super Mario World
				inspired take on Yoshi where he speaks 'yoshi' for example.<p>
		<h2>Wario's Woods: NES, SNES, Satellaview</h2>
				<p>Another puzzle game but you are Toad on the screen and you pick up the bombs and monsters to clear lines without trapping yourself.
				It's pretty fun.</p>

				<p>The plot is simple but nice enough. Wario takes over the woodlands with monsters and Toad, who is described as a hero, tries to stop
				him. Birdo and 'Sprites' as they are called help Toad along the way. There are several game modes in both NES and SNES versions and lots
				of unusual characters. Worth checking out for sure. </p>
