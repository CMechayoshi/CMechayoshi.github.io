			<p>Covered <a href="Mario_Oddities.html">here</a> already, these games from 1992 and 1993 were on both the NES, SNES, and even computers as part of the educational Mario Discovery series. Check out the link for more details on these strange games.
		
		
		<H2>Yoshi's Cookie: NES, Gameboy, SNES </h2>
				<p>This is a puzzle game from 1992 initially. Match the same types of cookies to clear a line. There are a bunch of rounds for single player and a two
				player mode. Puzzle mode is only in the SNES version where you are given limited moves to clear the stage. Find the manual <a href="https://themushroomkingdom.net/manuals/yc-nes.txt">here.</a><p>

				<p>Interesting notes of this game is that the SNES version which came out in 1993 has a more uptodate and less Super Mario World
				inspired take on Yoshi where he speaks 'yoshi' for example.<p>
				
		<h2>Wario's Woods: NES, SNES, Satellaview</h2>
				<p>Another puzzle game but you are Toad on the screen and you pick up the bombs and monsters to clear lines without trapping yourself.
				It's pretty fun.</p>

				<p>The plot is simple but nice enough. Wario takes over the woodlands with monsters and Toad, who is described as a hero, tries to stop
				him. Birdo and 'Sprites' as they are called help Toad along the way. There are several game modes in both NES and SNES versions and lots
				of unusual characters. Worth checking out for sure. </p>

		<h2>Mario Golf: N64, GBC</h2>
				<p>Kind of a wierd example but they are ports of each other for this generation. Developed by Camelot in 1999 these are golf games where Mario and co. play on fields with zany elements on them. The game boy color verions kicked off the brief trend where it have you play as humans characters and level up rgp style. Very interesting. You can use the transfer pack to bring characters over from the GBC version you'd never other wise see in 3D (or at all elsewhere).</p>
				
				<p>There's a bunch of modes in the N64 version from plain golf to ring shots and various skill modes. The main Mario cast is here, Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, Peach, Wario, Donkey Kong, Bowser, and some interesting additions like Baby Mario, the first time he'd be a baby clone inclusion and Metal Mario. This isn't mentioning the humans you can port over. I always thought it was sort of cool that they brought over OCs like that. These characters can have palette swaps too, unseen outside of Smash bros. In the gameboy version there are less playbable characters and a different structure with a hub and it involves you winning tournaments against computer controlled characters to rank up. For a portable port it's surprsingly playable and was recieved as well as the console version. </p>
				
							
				
		<h2>Mario Tennis 2000</h2>	
		
				<p>The millenium came and Camelot gave us something pretty sweet. Mario finally got his proper tennis game but not the first of course if we remember the Virtual Boy (as seen on this sites homepage image). Starting with the console version, like before there are lots of modes and solid gameplay with a nice roster even by today's standards. It also set precidents for games to come with the type attributes characters were given. Mario was balanced, Peach technique, Bowser power, Boo tricky, and etc.. In gameplay you can do various shots by the appropriate button combos. It's not the deepest ever, in fact the most simple compared to later games that would introduce gimmmick elements, that is not to say there is no strategy here.</p>
				
				
				<p>There is a lot of content here and lots of courses even if the unlock requirements are a little annoying and/or inovolve linking up with the gameboy version. Modes include the tournaments, ring shots, piranha challenge, and a Bowser stage with items to use Mario Kart style, very fun.</p>
