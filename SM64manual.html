		<H1>Interesting Things in Super Mario 64's Manual</H1>
			
			<p>In my typical fashion I’m taking a common thing and talking about something not so common about it. Everyone knows about 1996’s Super Mario 64, the best seller and revolutionary N64 game. There is a lot of picking and analysis of it and even the various differences between Japanese and English versions, the rereleases, etc. What is less spoken about however is it’s manual and the little details within, especially regarding it’s story. Nintendo hosts a pdf of the manual on the website but the overall layout and even a few images are altered. <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Support/Nintendo-64/Nintendo-64-manual-and-additional-documents/Nintendo-64-games-manuals/Nintendo-64-games-manuals-990819.html"> Here’s a link to that (leads to Nintendo UK)</a> All scans from me.</p>
