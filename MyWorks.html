<h2>Original Fiction 'Slammerverse' (under construction)</h2>

<a id="Org">
<p>I call the world of my original characters the 'Slammerverse'. While 99% of these works from my childhood to now are offline, I will share here a few things of interest like this WIP 'bestiary' list and (coming soon) a date list. I divide my stories in several eras I'll briefly explain so that these charts are somewhat intelligible. 'T-Bone Inc' era is little kid stuff, 2000s to 2004ish. 'Pirate era' was about middle school, 2005 to 2006. 'George Time' is middle school, 2006-late 2007. 'Party Heroes' era is high schoolish, 2008-2009ish. 'SRT' is high school and later, 2009 to 2016. 'Fanfiction era' would be anything beyond that as that's where most of my focus shifted, along with other post-school adult busy with life things.</p>

	<p><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11751950/1/Mario-and-Bowser-Frenemies-Forever" target="_blank">"Mario and Bowser: Frenemies Forever"</a>: My signature project from early 2016 through late 2017 and my second  submission to FF.net, actually my first work written specifically for the site. Loosely inspired by an old offline handwritten comic of mine called 'J-Man and the Dragon' and EchoEternal's <em>'Eternally Never Yours'</em> (or specifically the first few chapters of that), this story was dedicated to Mario and Bowser's intense rivalry and against expectations their surprising camaraderie. Without going too deep into the plot it was definitely a rocky submission and made up as I went, yet also one of my most popular stories and as you will see, an idea I could never quite let go. It has twists and turns for sure. The FF.net hyperlink is preserved above, but below you can find it without ads or leaving the site. Note that this is taken directly from FF.net. I uploaded portions of this on Wattpad and A03 but never formatted it right or completed the transfer. Also note that any typos etc are preserved.</p>

	<p><a href="FF1/Mario_and_Bowsers_New.html">"Mario and Bowser's New Frenemy Adventure"</a>: (Link removed, goes to hosted version) This project was my largest yet and a direct response to some of what I considered to be the largest issues of Frenemies Forever. It keeps at first the same premise, direct recreations of Frenemy Forever chapters, but then shifts into something grander with a dangerous threat that wraps all of the characters into its spiral. 'NFA' is split into two 'seasons', the first the setup and the second the aftermath. It was completed entirely in the year of 2018 and unlike the first story I tried to plan things in advance. The issue however was still ambivalence on direction, the end result released to the public being a cobbled together mix of various ideas. (Maybe not apparent to readers but distracting as the author.) Returning characters were exaggerated to various degrees for the sake of comedy and in fleshing them out, there were some slower interlude like moments to mixed feedback. Notably it also signified a shift into more mature themes with insanity, death, blood, grief, regret, etc, but in a way that in hindsight veered almost into 'edge' I felt. Despite that it still has some cool moments I believe, and Mario and Bowser have more frenemy action here than ever. The story is linked above and I have two documents to share, a 'Tropes' page and an internal notes page.</p>

	<p><b>What happened to 2019's Frenemies Forever 2?</b> You can find the old 'Redux' that was initially called Frenemies Forever 2 and reverted to FF2 again once I wrote the 2022-3 story <a href="PersonalCollections.html#FF2">HERE.</a></em> (Yeah, confusing for no reason, sorry..) See the <a href="MyWorks.html#11623">archives</a> for summary on that story and the archive below that for my thoughts when creating our currant Redux.</p>
<HR>
	
	<p><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13325995/1/Mario-and-Bowser-Frenemies-Forever-2" target="_blank">"Mario and Bowser: Frenemies Forever Redux" </a>: Linked on FF.net, but also on A03, from 2022-23.  The rewrite of FF2, replacing it on the internet, and giving us a more mature and nuanced take on Mario and Bowser's relationship. I think the summary is all you need: </p>

	<p>"<em>As the adage goes, 'keep your friends close and your enemies closer'!<br>
	But.. What if, despite yourself, the enemy was too close? When the Mushroom Kingdom to Dark Land Peace Pact is insidiously broken, the stakes become so high that everyone's secrets, even those buried deepest must come out.</em></p> 
	
	<p>The original 2016 Frenemies story was created during a very uncertain and transitional period in life, and this manifested in a tale that's jokey at the start, but becomes very earnest soon enough with depth we didn't get again in the sequel for a few reasons. For New Frenemy Adventure in 2018, life was more stable, and it shows with me being creative and experimental with a saccharine conclusion. Characters were heavily edited to fit the outrageous plot, and for some this stripped some attributes or flanderized them. Frenemies 2 in 2019 was to reign it in big time, to try to be raw, even bittersweet. In execution however, we have set ups with no pay offs for events, characters, and some situations that would have been interesting. </p>
	
	
	<p>That brings us to this fourth and final iteration, made from all I'd learned. While there is some of the celebration element from NFA in that I bring back a few old references, characters, etc, what's done is still to have plot relevance only. It legitimately goes for gray on gray morality in Mario's world and touches on the social commentary New Frenemy Adventure featured, except not parodied. The villains are reworked. The way the heroes learn of the 'mystery' is reworked, the rules of the universe, etc. All main characters, even some side ones  are fleshed out, and more. There still are laughs of course. The content warning is higher here than the others, beware.</p>

		<p><em>Summary: What if Peach was Punk? How would her friends and family react? Loosely inspired by Super Mario Bros Comic: Magic Carpet Madness.</em> (Note, not really based on that comic at all aside from how peach looks on the cover.)</p>
		
		<p>-This story has a simple AU ideal. 'What if Peach was Punk?'. The development was long, staring mid 2017 and finishing early 2019, but there was a lot of passion behind it, because I'm into music. My project 'The Mario Clash' came from this story for instance. It's a short but wild trip for Peach with a few references to other works of mine.</p>

	<p><em>Summary: Based off of the Nintendo Adventure Book, Bowser is making mega-monsters and its up to Mario and friends to stop him!</em> Long before creating my Nintendo Adventure Books guides, I did a pseudo version of that with this early fan-fiction. It's a novelization primarily of the infamous to my childhood Book #3 Monster Mixup, but since I have Mario make all of the correct choices, and in later chapters have author notes telling you what's up, it functions as a walk through too.</p> 
	
	<p>Other fun facts, this was the only story I started in 2016, the year I began to upload to FF.net and completed in that same year. Others would have to get their conclusion in 2017 or later, including Frenemies Forever org. I made a bizarre remix there here. <em>Summary: A corruption of the Nintendo Adventure Book and Pokemon Vietnamese Crystal. Bowser is making mega monsters...in bootleg zone!</em></p>

He's gonna be one 'Super' Mario...(Previously named 'A Freak in Mario's Clothing')</em> Okay, the images are getting less and less related I know, but this was a cool ideal I hadn't seen anyone do then or now. It's based on the short stunt of Doopliss copying Mario and that's it. Now it's for sure and old story, and there's a few self admitted errors, see author notes, but it's cool over all. I was proud of it, and it features characters I don't usually write, because I don't usually novelize games.</p>

	<h3>Chemistry</h3>

	<p style="text-align:center"><em>That moment when you create a baseball team and ten percent (maybe more depending on Diddy, Dixie, and Tiny) aren't of legal drinking age..</em></p>

	<p><em>Summary: In the world of Mario, why does THIS character and THAT character hate each other? A series of snarky fandom and meta commentary on silly roster choices and/or rivalries, memes, and more in the Mario universe. Starring: Everyone!… eventually...just give it time!</em></p>
	<p>	A truly fringe ideal of mine. Not my best work, or my most nuanced, or the only I'd make with a meta subtext, but boy was I snarky about stuff, and it resulted in one of my few purely comedy stories. The A03 is used for the html document since it shows the unique formatting I attempt here. The last line in the summary was supposed to be a reference to Magikoopa981's 'Nuclear Phantasy'. 
	</p>
	
	<p>We start basing on Super Mario Baseball, thus the title. Soon this devolves into a spat over baby characters in Mario Kart games and then somehow Bowsette, plus other memes. Like a few other stories of mine, this is vaguely in the Frenemies Forever universe, featuring some of the OCs. A few more stories below would do the same. Some draft versions of the first chapter were posted on my tumblr back in the day, but no reason to link those. It's not that interesting.</p>

	<p><em>Summary: Every Smash bros fanfiction in one story. Also Mr. G&W will do a thing, of course. Inspired by: Yoshizilla of course. Plus a few other fanfics I've read. Can you spot the references?</em> This one, like Chemistry is tied topically to a certain era, even more meta in a way because I'm playing with tropes and setups of popular Smash Brothers fan fictions in this story. While the short quirky style is a ref to Yoshizilla Rhedosaurus (who favorited this and noticed Senpai!), another big one was Smash Brothers on Facebook, Hot Topic, and other meme stories, plus some very early Frenemies Forever stuff tossed in with OCs. I write in general a couple of characters you'll never see in other works of mine, as they aren't Mario ones. As this is purely in 2017, it's super sophomoric and never meant to be taken too seriously, so enjoy. -Unfinished unfortunately.

	<p><em>Summary: One innocent Monday Mario and friends realize they now possess a new 'gift'- All except for one of them. How does his world cope when secrets can be no more?</em> Based on a writing prompt and part of a series of Mario stories I was doing in 2018. Soon to be added here, they consisted of ideals I'd never seen in a story. Here Mario and co try to live their lives, again in a world vaguely from Frenemies Forever, except they can read each other's mind. Well, almost all of them, leading to the twists and turns in store. Besides being a one shot, very atypical for me, its a Marioish save the princess plot, another thing I don't like to do normally. This never gained a ton of attention but liked the ideal and execution, and this was actually written out on paper before digital upload. I speak about it in author notes. -One shot.

	<p><em>Summary: Goombas were the last to join Bowser's army. (Fact) This however isn't. (Maybe)</em> Part of my 'experimental prompt' series sorta for 2018, this one-shot is based on the fact that goombas were the last enemy programmed for Super Mario Bros 1. Why? Koopa Troopas were thought to be a little too advanced for a brand new player, so the goombas that greet you first in this famous game were the last! Irony! This also creates, as I touch on in story, the narrative that the goombas were once with the Mushroom Kingdom but rebelled, an angle actual games after SMB1 don't touch on ever.

	<p><em>Summary: Can Toad keep his head straight as he discovers new and weird alternate universes?</em> A very odd one of mine and one of the longest lasting stories, created late 2016 and actually completed early 2019. And yet it's only four chapters! Firstly, not this isn't based on Super Paper Mario. It might have went there at some point, but like many early stories this was seat of pants. What's a little unique is that I referenced this not once, but twice in the original Frenemies Forever (And Monster Mix up too in those). The short tale we have is surprisingly written well beyond the first chapter of antics and chatter, plus I find it funny, even though this was more about me being experimental and provocative than 'comedic' (compared to Chemistry for instance). Enjoy something different.<p>

	<p>Where to start..  We sorta have another 'Chemistry' here where I'm being topical and bold and somewhat snarky about Nintendo's interpretations, except here there's other experimental elements on display. The continuity is of New Frenemy Adventure, and it's in first person from Toadette's pov with an intentional wacky ending. It's also a one shot to further not fit in with my usual style. This didn't pick up traction for not entirely unexpected reasons given, but to this day I'm proud of the prompt.

	<p>My works page hosts mostly the stories I'm proud of, so why are this rougher stories here instead of Personal Collections? Well, I am proud, sorta, concept wise at least. Ludwig is my favorite koopaling and I do love music. The Rhapsody story was a very early published one for me, ruder and cruder to the point of making a reviewer freak out, which was funny, but not where I really want to do anyway with the concept of Ludwig going 'pop'. I created in 2017 the second story, a more affectionate take and a one shot that wraps itself up nicely.

	<p style="text-align:center"><em>Okay fine, that blurb at the far top lied. Chicken scratch IS what you'll find here sometimes. In all seriousness this is the the fic's official art on FF.net, so here it goes.-From my iPad (literally).</em></p>
	
	<p><em>Summary:A strange accident sends Bowser into an alternate dimension where he relives the events of Super Mario 64. From Mario's perspective!</em></p>
	
	<p>Simple premise with Bowser and our deuteragonist Lakitu, but it works. This is one of my funniest stories to me, because there's a lot to grab from when Bowser's running around Super Mario 64 levels, but also I'm super passionate about that game in general and every chapter was so fun to write. Not complete but on hiatus rather than canceled. Since it's a long term project, you will see some changes in writing style over the story.

	<p><em>Poems remembering the greatness of Mario Kart Wii. Inspired by 'Mario Kart Wii Anniversary Haiku' by breath20k and 'Ten Years of Bliss' by SuperCube64. UPDATE: Added a few other general poems</em></p>
	
	<p>A rare instance of me making a response to someone else fic, but I couldn't help myself. Mario Kart Wii is one of my favorite games. Later I added a few I was sitting on for a while. The summary tells you the rest, and yes I realize my so called haikus aren't exactly how they should be. Read the two chapters

	<p><em>Summary: Mario must save the Princess in an alternate universe where the sky is much bluer, Luigi is not his brother, the false Bowsers aren't false, and there's a strange Hudson Soft powerup… (Short stories)</em></p>
	
	<p>An alternate take on Mario based on the quirky, sorta not that great, but historically still interesting and important Hudson port of SMB1 for computers of the time. It didn't go as far as I wanted and it's of a short story format, but I thought I made it cool while it lasted. Being that it was written late 2018 to early 2019, it has that down to Earth tone I was adopting and would use for Frenemies Forever 2, rather than being so over the top like my 2018 stories were with their weirdness.

		<p><em>Summary: Iggy is an outcast to outcasts, utterly a dork, a loser, and worst of all a bad soldier for Bowser. One day he becomes his own test subject for a 'womanizing spray' that makes him irresistibly likable to all. Will he ever get more than he bargained for! (Note: Not a shipping story) </em></p>
		
		<p>So, this was written during the time I was writing Frenemies Forever 2, then setbacks happened and Eddie Van Halen actually passed away. While that didn't completely halt the story, other events did. Cue later, when I've not only completed FF2 but Redux and I'm looking at old documents. I determined I had something here worth completeing and so I did. There is a tone shift, but I think it works out.

<h3>Archived 11/16/23</h3>

<p><b>Old summary for Mario and Bowser: Frenemies Forever Redux when it was being rewritten:</b> This 2019 work was meant to tell the definite twisted tale of Mario and Bowser's frenemy ways and how this affects everyone around them. Like New Frenemy Adventure the start emulates Frenemies Forever yet again I subvert things. The new villain is reused from the above but most of the godlike powers are toned down so as to not have such an unbeatable threat. Many characters return but others don't or are under emphasized to keep the story lean and uncluttered. Emphasis was made on having a plot coherent from start to finish without too much distracting mystery. FF2 remains more mature, but this time instead of by gory or grim details, from the more grounded and dynamic characters going through more mature and grey area situations. The plenty of references return but in a way that doesn't rely on much knowledge of the other stories. Also fittingly for the final story, Mario and Bowser's relationship is set in stone forever- if that's not too much of a spoiler. Linked above is the story, completed though some edits continue into more recently, and the archive below has the internal author notes and trope page.</p>

<p>Regarding the Redux 2022 rewrite. These notes were meant for when I concurrently hosted the original and rewrite. Since I am now exclusively hosting the rewrite only, these notes aren't needed up there. (Story can be read on the <a href="PersonalCollections.html#FF2">'Personal Collections'</a> tab. The links to supplementary materials for the 2019 version can also be found here.</p>


	<ol>
		<li>Overall improvements of writing, less typos, consistent devices used and characterization from start to finish
		<li>Partially due to grandfathering, all versions of the story (going back to the original FF1 and NFA) have weaker beginning sections. The Revise will finally give the start of the story the same care and depth the later chapters get.
		<li> In Redux, despite edits to mitigate, some character arcs set up go no where and now will have their full resolve without taking over (aka NFA)
		<li>Some new ideas and quirks can be added, again to flesh out characters and make the world fantastical yet believable. (Luigi's photography, <s>the idea that the Jewel of the Stars possesses Mario</s>, Mario and Bowser's feelings expounded greatly)

 <h3>*Update!* 8/4/21 (a bit wordy, see the TL;DR at bottom) </h3>
 
	<p>Hi again, it’s about time I explain what’s happening with The Mario Clash as a musical project. I’ve  planned two EPs, “H.A.A.E. ii v.2”  and “A Whole New Level”. The process however was.. not so smooth. Now I’m just gonna release the demos so far. Tracks that are my experiments from using new recording techniques and software. If you are unfamiliar, my old recording method was with Garageband on iOS. With no microphone I would use the tablet’s built in mic to record my live amps. Other effects including the drums would come from Garageband and nothing else. That’s some legitimately powerful and useful software but there were issues regardless and I wanted to produce better sounding live music- not necessarily studio recording level but free from the ordeals I dealt with in ‘BooTracker 3000’ (2016), Hand And Arm Exhaustion’ (2018) and very recently ‘Hand And Arm Exhaustion 2’ (2021). </p>
	
	<p>Now to the present time, I bought a Steinberg interface, Reaper for the PC, and a Shure SM57. Problem solved? In ways yes and no, bringing me to the current project. I wanted to rerecord some tracks from HAAE 2 that I just couldn’t get clean or tight enough along with a new ‘A Whole New Level’ EP that would have a new theme and style of song writing. </p>
	
	<p>The bad: I’m still learning the secrets of good production. No obstacle here but to practice and learn more. Also the drums frankly suck. On Garageband I was often playing the drums myself and that software has some good sounding drum samples. This certainly had it’s own issues considering I’m not really a drummer and did it all on a touch screen, but it had advantages of a better sound with no clipping and the freedom to change the feel and tempo on the spot. Now I’m using a free program called Hydrogen drum machine to create the drum tracks and then importing them into Reaper where I record the rest of the instruments. Hydrogen however has some awful stock sounds and not even that many packs to add and improve it. It also takes forever to do program certain things that aren’t strictly on grid. That may not be the programs fault but it is something I miss from Garageband where I was manually controlling the tempo. (Remember, I never quantize- ever!)  Reaper has a plethora of VSTs to use but of course some of the exact ones I was fond of in Garageband aren’t there, and substitutions are necessitated.  Again not really its fault. The last issue is so small but one that irritates me most. I can’t easily add album artwork like Garageband did. Windows is supposed to have several ways to do so without third-party software but none of them work!</p>
	
	<p>The good: Better recording quality, period. This goes for instruments, vocals, whatever.  I can now double track and mix without slowing down my system. (Previously I could only really pan the guitar one side and bass another. Trust me, anything else was too heavy for the iPad and/or turned into mud) I have much better live amps and equipment to work with too. </p>
	
	<p>Well, that sure seems like more bad than good does it? Actually a lot of that bad can be negated by me becoming more experienced with my new tools and finding alternatives, especially regarding drums. Because of that however I’m not ready to seriously release anything just yet. So now I present what I got so far via Google drive. But there is a little more to this still. For more details track by track, see the release way below under ‘H.A.A.E ii v.2/ A Whole New Level (Demo)’ </p>
	
	<p><b>TL;DR: I’m came pretty far with new equipment but still need time to work out the kinks and produce tracks to my new standard of quality.</b> </p>
