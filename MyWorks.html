Will Mario and Bowser's associates approve? Was the illness that disrupted their tennis match part of something bigger?</em></p>

	<p>My signature project from early 2016 through late 2017, my second submission to FF.net, and my first work written specifically for the site. Loosely inspired by an old offline handwritten comic of mine called 'J-Man and the Dragon' and EchoEternal's <em>'Eternally Never Yours'</em> (or specifically the first few chapters of that), this story was dedicated to Mario and Bowser's intense rivalry <em>and</em> camaraderie. While rocky it is one of my most popular stories. The hyperlink is preserved above, but below you can find it without ads or leaving the site.</p>

			<ul>
			<li>I regard this fic better now than I did after completion in 2017, where all I could notice were the errors. I can appreciate this today as an off the cuff yet earnest effort. As expounded in supplementary material like the Tropes doc, the real plot here involves how Mario and Bowser's <em>friends</em> react to the stunning revelation that they are 'friends', while the titular duo get separated after a few chapters. Not technically a mistake, just a consequence of me making this up as I went. I do try to make characters dynamic and interesting and I believe I succeed on some level, despite this being my first time writing most of them. It's not trying to hard to be funny nor get over its head with a cosmic conflict. (See the spoilers of the next story). If I could tighten up parts and cut the chatter, I'd rate this just behind Redux. When FF1 gains momentum I think it's a great story with a bookend-like conclusion that is far more natural than it's sequels. The two epilogues are clunkily me trying to patch up  loose ends of course, but ultimately ambiguity remains over certain bits, the better choice compared to again some observations you'll see below.</li>

	<p><em> Mario and friends (and enemies) experience love, hate, and everything in between as they learn that sometimes the true villains aren't the ones fought in the games... Other Genres: Humor/ Suspense (T rating for later chapters)</em>
	</p>
	
	<p>A direct response to some of what I considered to be the largest issues of Frenemies Forever, including the fact that Mario and Bowser don't get to work together for long. The first few chapters are a recreation of 'FF1', but then spirals considerably with a newly introduced foe that cannot be defeated by mere mortals! The stakes are always rising in this one, and there are more character interactions and jokes than ever. It was completed entirely in the year of 2018 and so planned in advance that I have a plethora of unused material and alternate directions linked below. Notably it also signified a shift into more mature themes with and more T rated content. There's some cool moments all throughout the story, but if you're not already a fan of the series, I'd recommend you stick with FF1 to see my rough draft of the idea and Redux for the finalized. See the spoilers for the straight dope.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>I grew a lot from this project, what I learned for a certainty making my later works much more focused and restrained. For 'NFA' I struggled with ambivalence on direction and it shows. The end result is coherent, but from being cobbled from various ideas meant to be more than they are, it's not balanced. There is a plot, and unlike FF1 things don't just randomly get introduced, but antic filled sequences take the forefront often. Returning characters were exaggerated to various degrees for the sake of comedy. At the same time when trying to flesh them out, I did so via some slower interlude like moments to mixed feedback, plus sometimes we were doing that with OCs, which will also be YMMW. There are still a lot of cool things going on in this fic, but there for the sake of being there. It's like a fan fic of a fan fic, not the easiest sale when 'FF2' and Redux put their story first and squeeze the funny bits, antics, and banter in between the gaps left. </li>

	<p>Hosted on FF.net and A03, from 2022-23. Rewritten late 2024. This replaced <a href="#FF2">Frenemies Forever 2</a> on the internet (except for my archive) and is my final take:</p>

	<p>"<em>As the adage goes, 'keep your friends close and your enemies closer! -What if the enemy was too close? When the Mushroom Kingdom to Dark Land Peace Pact is burnt up and scattered into the wind by an elliptical threat, everyone's secrets, even those buried deepest must come out. </em></p> 
	
	<p>Taking heavier cues from 'FF1', Redux is a tale secrets, conspiracies, different experiences in life, and how people deal and have dealt with it. Oh and there's a legion of super villains out there, ready to destroy Earth, so they'd better get it together soon. </p>

		<ul>
			<li>The original 2016 Frenemies story was created during a very uncertain and transitional period in life, manifesting in a tale that shifts from jokey to serious to me just doing my best. For New Frenemy Adventure in 2018, life was more stable and it showed with me being creative and experimental, unable to reel in what kind of tale I wanted to make. The saccharine conclusion and exaggerated characters striped some of the depth their older FF1 versions had, so I made Frenemies 2. Written initially in 2019, was to reign it in big time, to try to be raw, even bittersweet. In execution however, I felt like I'd hammered in the wrong message, with a conclusion that's not satisfying enough. That lead to Redux in 2022.</li>
			
			<li>The aim for Redux was to take what I felt worked and drop what didn't. don't overly shy away from references, new characters, etc, yet I make sure whatever happens is primarily to have plot relevance. The tone is finally consistent from the first to final chapter. The rewrite and later 2025 edits adjusts and enhances elements better explained in supplementary material # 2 above, or under 'fixer fic' on the Trope page, but does not fundamentally change what the story is. Check it out!

The development was off and on, staring mid 2017 and finishing early 2019, but there was a lot of passion behind this wild trip.</p>

			<ul>
			<li>Written well overall for how early it was. Besides puns based on real life punk bands, the references to my other contemporary works aren't too heavy handed either. The only thing I'd rework are some of the Koopalings. Besides Ludwig they have no role except in the end, and I didn't quite know how to capture their dynamic then. If you look at the date for that chapter, it is BEFORE 'Mario and Bowser's New Frenemy Adventure', which explains quite a bit. Bigger stories were usually where I refined characterization. Last, I defictionalized <a href="TheMarioClash.html#Mario">'The Mario Clash'</a> from this story. Other than that *chef's kiss* </li>

	<p><em>Summary: Based off of the Nintendo Adventure Book, Bowser is making mega-monsters and its up to Mario and friends to stop him!</em></p>

	<p>Long before creating my Nintendo Adventure Books guides, I did a pseudo version of that with this early fan-fiction. It's a novelization primarily of the infamous to my childhood Book #3 Monster Mixup, but since I have Mario make all of the correct choices, and in later chapters have author notes telling you what's up, it functions as a walk through too.</p> 
	
	<p>Other fun facts, this was the only story I started in 2016, the year I began to upload to FF.net and completed in that same year. Others would have to get their conclusion in 2017 or later, including Frenemies Forever org. I made a crossover:</p>

	<p>While this starts out as Mario Superstar Baseball story of all things, it soon devolves a loose plot that's more or less a vehicle for me to be snarky about the contemporary Mario fandom. Logically, this wouldn't age well forever. We have baby character bashing, Bowsette bashing, plus other memes mentioned with some Frenemies Forever OCs randomly here or there. Some draft versions of the first chapter were posted on my Tumblr back in the day, but no reason to link those. (Except I did later anyway; see <a href="Tumblrtales.html#Chem">here</a>) It's not that interesting. Lastly, the last line in the summary was supposed to be a reference to Magikoopa981's 'Nuclear Phantasy'. See the spoilers for the straight dope.

			<li>This couldn't be a more 2018 story (well, if we ignore that the first chapter was drafted up a few times in 2017; see: <a href="Tumblrtales.html#Chem">the drafts</a>), written just like New Frenemy Adventure in being over the top. It's so specific sometimes that I understand why a lot of readers won't get it, and the plot is basically a string of antics so I could target whatever I wanted, but whatever. I like it for some reason. With the comedic focus the characterization is exaggerated and OOC on purpose sometimes, and I play with formatting atypically. I'd only fix a few errors and have less of an anticlimactic ending. In all fairness I didn't want the story to be on hiatus forever and I guess my fervor ran out by the time 2019 came around. Anyway, read it!</li>

As this is purely in 2017, it's amateurish and never meant to be taken too seriously, so enjoy. -Unfinished unfortunately.

			<li>I cover my thoughts above mostly. I do think this is funny for what we get, and decently written for the age. Since I wasn't super familiar with some of the characters beyond the basics, I stick to basics. The plot is also just a string of antics with Frenemies Forever OCs are thrown in, albeit cheekily to jab at it. So, yeah a bit all over the place, but not too off putting due to short length. I dropped off in 2017 because from the dates it looks like I was at the tail end of Frenemies Forever 1 and other stuff.</li>

			<li>I'm fond of this 2019 story, going all out with an idea without much concern over popularity or trend chasing. We have a lot of low-key absurdity, leading to a save the princess plot with a subversion here or there. We have a rare inclusion of Tatanga as a villain here, and I have Luigi and Daisy getting engaged, plus some good action with fast pacing, even some Mario and Bowser frenemy action in the end. There's not much else to add. Fun fact: the working title in my handwritten drafts was 'Alien Brainwave Technique', but I wanted to connect it to Mario and settled on Psyche Out eventually. </li>

			<li>This once makes me mad at myself a little, because I only get to two alternate worlds, not counting the desertic area as introduced in the first chapter or what seems to be in the final, but isn't without giving it all away. Very seat of pants , but some good writing here and there. In fact the third chapter is one of my favorites. What's also unique is that I referenced this (and Monster Mix-Up) not once, but twice in the original Frenemies Forever in a strange cross promotion of sorts.

	<p><em>Summary: An innocuous DNA test from Prof. Gadd reveals that toads never had genders at all...ZOMG? How will Toadette (known for being the most famous Toad female) change science? She can't. But she can take a third option… </em></p>
	
	<p>Really that explained it. We sorta have another 'Chemistry' here, full of snark in a more organized fashion. The continuity is of New Frenemy Adventure, and it's in first person from Toadette's pov. I'm proud of this prompt to this day.

			<ul>
			<li>I thought this was a bit provocative at the time, and I think it's only gotten more so for poking fun at the idea. I like how I wrapped this one up without overly taking a stance outside the main character's thoughts and biases. No revolution came despite the world adjusting overnight to this new element, but Toadette got her statement across and that's all that matters. Since this is contemporary with New Frenemy Adventure, I have Toadette dating Captain Toad, even though in the final drafts of NFA they aren't. Oh well.

		<h3>Rhapsody est Vendere/The Day Ludwig Went Pop</h3>

	<p style="text-align:center"><em>Art by wackko200, whom I will gladly shoutout, especially since I think she was a contributor of Lemmy's Land.</em></p>
	
	
	
	<p><em>Summaries: Ludwig Von Koopa, master composer is making ridiculously dumb pop music? Is the greatest musician in Darkland now a sell out? Now how will he recover from his damaged reputation? -AND-  For the master composer, Ludwig Von Koopa, concerts are a way of life. But what about pop concerts? How will his friends and family take it? For music lovers!</em></p>
	
	<p>Yes, I love Ludwig and music. The Rhapsody story, loosely translating to 'Rhapsody of a Sell-out' was an early submission, with it's attempts at humor making a sensitive reviewer pop off. That was baffling, unexpected, and sorta funny at the time, but not where I really want to go with the concept of Ludwig going 'pop'.</p>
	
	<p>I created in 2017 the second story, a more affectionate take and a one shot that wraps itself up nicely. Check out where it began in <a href="FF1/Rhapsody.htm">Rhapsody Est Vendere</a> here. (Three chapters) Or the later, more refined <a href="FF1/LudwigWentpop.htm">Ludwig goes Pop</a> here. (One shot).</p> 
	
	<details>

			<ul>
			<li>Rhapsody is all over the place, very contemporary of Frenemies Forever 1 by being speech centric and about conspiracies. The characterization is off for some Koopalings, but this was actually the first fan fic I'd done with them, not counting <a href="PersonalCollections.html#Org">Slammerverse</a>stuff. Note that despite pop and dubstep and other popular genres were being jabbed at here, this clearly isn't me slamming what I hate, though while demonstrating Iggy's insanity (another character trait I'd drop in other tales) I made fun of 'triggering' which appropriately triggered some guest reviewer. Quite an overreaction if you see the actual 'joke'.
			<li>Back to square one with Ludwig Goes Pop, with a conflict that's more internal than external, though Ludwig still faces some ribbing over his appreciation of less sophisticated genres. I put in extra backstory, toss in a few minor OCs to complete the picture and give it a happy ending. The only thing I'd change would be to not reference real songs and singers, just a pet peeve of mine. This being 2017 written though, that predates New Frenemy Adventure where I'd start parodying names. Anyway, enjoy!

			<li> I think the opener is strong, it just needed to be reigned in in a way I couldn't do in 2016-17, where I was writing whatever I thought of at the moment. Too bad once I picked it back up in the years after and I'd introduced some rising stakes, the motivation was gone. In the meantime, this has some good jokes without being too absurd and the references are super topical. This is one story where mentioning real life elements not only work but were necessary. Are you nostalgic too? Just curious? Check it out.

	<p><em>Summary: A strange accident sends Bowser into an alternate dimension where he relives the events of Super Mario 64. From Mario's perspective!</em></p>
	
	<p>Simple premise with Bowser and our deuteragonist Lakitu, but it works. This is one of my funniest stories to me, because there's a lot to grab from when Bowser's running around Super Mario 64 levels, but also I'm super passionate about that game in general and every chapter was so fun to write. Not complete but on hiatus rather than canceled. Since it's a long term project, you will see some changes in writing style over the story.

			<li>I love this story and I gets better as it goes on. It's almost a better Toad in the Whoa Zone, because I do treat each the the paintings  like a self contained wacky adventure, playing with the elements and taking all of the interesting bits from star missions, or doing something different. Jokes are rapid fire, sometimes a bit dicey early on, mellowing considerably later, but either way hilarious to me. Check it out!

			<li>Good idea, bad fit for me? To be fair this was a unique idea, but the differences between the Sharp X1 port of SMB1 and the NES version doesn't make for a bombastic novelization. At the end of the day this is a fish out of water story, following Mario's introduction to the Mushroom Kingdom. Sound familiar? With me liking to be different, I hope you can see now how I fell off from the idea.

			<li>The story that almost wasn't! I'm almost happy I completed it later, because I had a far better grasp on the Koopaling cast by then, able to capture the emotions behind ostracization, bullying, lack of fulfillment, and depression. At the same it lightens up as Iggy becomes 'irresistible', full of gags in my current style, and of course some secrets and twists. Check it out!
