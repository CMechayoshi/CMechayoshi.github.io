<h2>Original Fiction 'Slammerverse' (under construction)</h2>

<a id="Org">
<p>I call the world of my original characters the 'Slammerverse'. While 99% of these works from my childhood to now are offline, I will share here a few things of interest like this WIP 'bestiary' list and (coming soon) a date list. I divide my stories in several eras I'll briefly explain so that these charts are somewhat intelligible. 'T-Bone Inc' era is little kid stuff, 2000s to 2004ish. 'Pirate era' was about middle school, 2005 to 2006. 'George Time' is middle school, 2006-late 2007. 'Party Heroes' era is high schoolish, 2008-2009ish. 'SRT' is high school and later, 2009 to 2016. 'Fanfiction era' would be anything beyond that as that's where most of my focus shifted, along with other post-school adult busy with life things.</p>

<p><em>Summary: Original fiction about the rival/siblings Jordan and Summer. (Also from "with friends like these") story kind of based off of Engrish shirt in picture. Jordan would do anything to save a buck, Summer would do anything to keep Jordan in check.</em>

<p>Like the other story, this was worked on off-line and this one even rewritten and completed in a journal of mine. I'll see what I can do about showing the best version of this. For now, enjoy.</p>

<h3> Mario and Bowser: Frenemies Forever/ New Frenemy Adventure/ Redux</h3>

<img src="PaperImages/503px-VibeScepter.png" alt="Mario and Bowser" style="width:300px">

Will Mario and Bowser's associates approve? Was the illness that disrupted their tennis match part of something bigger? ... Other genres: Drama, humor</em></p>

	<p>My signature project from early 2016 through late 2017, my second submission to FF.net, and my first work written specifically for the site. Loosely inspired by an old offline handwritten comic of mine called 'J-Man and the Dragon' and EchoEternal's <em>'Eternally Never Yours'</em> (or specifically the first few chapters of that), this story was dedicated to Mario and Bowser's intense rivalry and against expectations their surprising camaraderie. Without going too deep into the plot it was definitely a rocky submission and made up as I went, yet also one of my most popular stories and as you will see, an idea I could never quite let go. The FF.net hyperlink is preserved above, but below you can find it without ads or leaving the site. Note that this is taken directly from FF.net. I uploaded portions of this on Wattpad and A03 but never formatted it right or completed the transfer. Also note that any typos etc are preserved.</p>

			<ul>
			<li>I regard this fic better now than I did after completion in 2017, where all I could notice were plot holes, tone shifts, and other issues. I can appreciate this today as an off the cuff yet earnest effort. As expounded in supplementary material like the Tropes doc, the real plot here involves how Mario and Bowser's <em>friends</em> react to the stunning revelation that they are 'friends', while the titular duo get separated after a few chapters. Not technically a mistake, just a consequence of me making this up as I went. I do try to make characters dynamic and interesting and I believe I succeed on some level, despite this being my first time writing most of them. It's not trying to hard to be funny nor get over its head with a cosmic conflict. (See the spoilers of the next story). If I could tighten up parts and cut the chatter, I'd rate this just behind Redux. When FF1 gains momentum I think it's a great story with a bookend-like conclusion that is far more natural than it's sequels. The two epilogues are clunkily me trying to patch up  loose ends of course, but ultimately ambiguity remains over certain bits, the better choice compared to again some observations you'll see below.</li>

Other Genres: Humor/ Suspense (T rating for later chapters)</em></p>
	
	<p>A direct response to some of what I considered to be the largest issues of Frenemies Forever, including the fact that Mario and Bowser don't get to work together for long. It keeps at first the same premise, direct recreations of FF1 chapters, and even has the same villains, but then spirals considerably with a newly introduced foe that cannot be defeated by mere mortals! 'NFA' is split into two 'seasons', a setup and aftermath with an intentional tone shift. The stakes are always rising in this one, and there are more character interactions and jokes than ever. It was completed entirely in the year of 2018 and so planned in advance that I have a plethora of unused material and alternate directions linked below. Notably it also signified a shift into more mature themes with and more T rated content. There's some cool moments all throughout the story, but if you're not already a fan of the series, I'd almost recommend you stick with FF1 and then Redux much later for a few reasons. See the spoilers for the straight dope.</p>
	
	<details>
		<summary>Click for more of my observations (may contain spoilers)</summary>

		<ul>
			<li>I grew a lot from this project, what I learned for a certainty making my later works much more focused and restrained- just overall better. For 'NFA' unfortunately I struggled with ambivalence on direction. The end result is coherent, but from being cobbled from various ideals meant to be more than they are, it's not balanced. There is a plot, and unlike FF1 things don't just randomly get introduced, but antic filled sequences take the forefront often. Returning characters were exaggerated to various degrees for the sake of comedy. At the same time when trying to flesh them out, I did so via some slower interlude like moments to mixed feedback, plus sometimes we were doing that with OCs, which will also be ymmv. Now going back to the opener, the voices I will still use now for most Mario characters came from here. There are a lot of cool things going on in this fic, but there for the sake of being there. It's like a fan fic of a fan fic, not the easiest sale when FF2 below and Redux put their story first and instead squeeze the funny bits, antics, and banter in between the gaps left. </li>

See the <a href="MyWorks.html#11623">archives</a> for summary on that story and the archive below that for my thoughts when creating our currant Redux.</p>

	<p><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13325995/1/Mario-and-Bowser-Frenemies-Forever-2" target="_blank">"Mario and Bowser: Frenemies Forever Redux" </a>: Linked on FF.net, but also on A03, from 2022-23.  The rewrite of FF2, replacing it on the internet, and giving us a more mature and nuanced take on Mario and Bowser's relationship. I think the summary is all you need: </p>

	<p>"<em>As the adage goes, 'keep your friends close and your enemies closer'!<br>
	But.. What if, despite yourself, the enemy was too close? When the Mushroom Kingdom to Dark Land Peace Pact is insidiously broken, the stakes become so high that everyone's secrets, even those buried deepest must come out.</em></p> 
	
	<p></p>
	
		<details>
		<summary>Click for more of my observations (global), (may contain spoilers)</summary>

		<ul>
			<li>The original 2016 Frenemies story was created during a very uncertain and transitional period in life, manifesting in a tale that shifts from jokey to serious. For New Frenemy Adventure in 2018, life was more stable and it showed with me being creative and experimental. The saccharine conclusion and flanderized characters striped some of the depth their older FF1 versions had and I recognized this as a misstep, resulting in Frenemies 2. Written initially in 2019, was to reign it in big time, to try to be raw, even bittersweet. In execution however, we have set-ups with no pay offs for events, some characters that could have been delved into but aren't, and still some pacing problems that not even the edits done later could totally fix.</li>
			
			<li>For Redux I go all out with the ideal, taking the bits that worked from the previous tales and dropping what didn't. I don't overly shy away from references, new characters, etc, yet I make sure whatever happens is primarily to have plot relevance. I have Mario and Bowser's relationship a friendship and/or community divider like in FF1. I borrow the social commentary, zany OCs, cosmic villainy, and artifacts from New Frenemy Adventure without it requiring lots of backstory or overrunning the show. I make the Mushroom Flu an epidemic with a scandalous past that ties Peach and Bowser together, and use a simplified rule set for Dark Stars like in FF2. </li>
			
			<li>I like this one a lot, especially with the edits. As I mention in the final chapter, as I do no epilogue here purposefully, I don't explore everything possible, but that's also the thing. I give you just enough. Everything connects, even seemingly unrelated bits, and I'm not afraid to have some of the edgy NFA had. The content warning is higher here than the others, but not without reason. Enjoy.

		<p><em>Summary: What if Peach was Punk? How would her friends and family react? Loosely inspired by Super Mario Bros Comic: Magic Carpet Madness.</em> (Note, not really based on that comic at all aside from how peach looks on the cover.)</p>
		
		<p>-This story has a simple AU ideal. 'What if Peach was Punk?'. The development was off and on, staring mid 2017 and finishing early 2019, but there was a lot of passion behind it, because I'm into music. My project 'The Mario Clash' came from this story for instance. It's a short but wild trip. See the section below.</p>

			<ul>
			<li>Written well overall for how early it was. The plot of Peach sneaking to a concert at Bowser's Castle coincidentally when Bowser leaves his place to kidnap her for the same concerts she's already attending incognito was unique I felt, and liked the way it all falls apart too. Overall it's fast paced, funny, and reasonably in character despite being AU. Besides puns based on real life punk bands, the references to my other contemporary works aren't too heavy handed either. The only thing I'd change majorly is reworking the Koopalings. Besides Ludwig they pop in towards the end for some reason, and I don't quite have their dynamic right. If you look at the date for that chapter, it is BEFORE 'Mario and Bowser's New Frenemy Adventure', where I would write the Koopalings in detail and consequently get my voice on them down more. As they appear its a bit draggy and stereotypical. Other than that *chef's kiss* </li>

	<p><em>Summary: Based off of the Nintendo Adventure Book, Bowser is making mega-monsters and its up to Mario and friends to stop him!</em> Long before creating my Nintendo Adventure Books guides, I did a pseudo version of that with this early fan-fiction. It's a novelization primarily of the infamous to my childhood Book #3 Monster Mixup, but since I have Mario make all of the correct choices, and in later chapters have author notes telling you what's up, it functions as a walk through too.</p> 
	
	<p>Other fun facts, this was the only story I started in 2016, the year I began to upload to FF.net and completed in that same year. Others would have to get their conclusion in 2017 or later, including Frenemies Forever org.

			<li>While the ideal is great, it's a more overtly first year work of mine. The attempts at humor are unrefined, even compared to stories like 'Chemistry' below where I'm totally off the cuff, but it's short and structured because I'm not the one writing the plot technically.</li>

			<ul>
			<li>Early on I determined that I was going to write different stuff than everyone else, and since there was a plethora of Paper Mario fan fics, why should I bother? Well, because no one had done this plot. It's a sophomoric work that meanders a bit and has errors that I catch and apologize for in later chapters, but it has some funny moments and when it's down to business it delivers. I included content warnings for 'racy' jokes and themes, which might seem weird and overly cautious if you read later material of mine. Frenemies Forever 1 has a similar situation where I content warn midway for violence that isn't that bad at all, but I mentioned blood so I was covering my tail. Anyway, besides a few clunky parts this gets a thumbs up. </li>

	<p>While this starts out as Mario Superstar Baseball story of all things, it soon devolves a loose plot that's more or less a vehicle for me to be snarky or affectionate, often zigzagging of elements in the contemporary Mario fandom. Logically, this wouldn't age well forever. We have baby character bashing, Bowsette bashing, plus other memes mentioned with some Frenemies Forever OCs randomly here or there. 
	Some draft versions of the first chapter were posted on my Tumblr back in the day, but no reason to link those. (Except I did later anyway; see Personal Collections tab) It's not that interesting. Lastly, the last line in the summary was supposed to be a reference to Magikoopa981's 'Nuclear Phantasy'. See the spoilers for the straight dope.

			<li>This couldn't be a more 2018 story (well, if we ignore that the first chapter was drafted up a few times in 2017; see: Personal Collections tab for the drafts), written just like New Frenemy Adventure in being over the top. It's so specific sometimes that I understand why a lot of readers won't get it, and the plot is basically a string of antics so I could target whatever I wanted, but whatever. I like it for some reason. With the comedic focus the characterization is exaggerated and OOC on purpose sometimes, and I play with formatting atypically. I'd only fix a few errors and have less of an anticlimactic ending. In all fairness I didn't want the story to be on hiatus forever and I guess my fervor ran out by the time 2019 came around. Anyway, read it!</li>

			<li>I cover my thoughts above mostly. I do think this is funny for what we get, and decently written for the age. Since I wasn't super familiar with some of the characters beyond the basics, I thus stick to basics. The plot is also just a string of antics and Frenemies Forever OCs are thrown in, albeit cheekily to jab at stories doing that in general. So, yeah a bit all over the place, but not too off putting due to short length. I dropped off in 2017 because from the dates it looks like I was at the tail end of Frenemies Forever 1, and likely other stuff.</li>

	<p><em>Summary: One innocent Monday Mario and friends realize they now possess a new 'gift'- All except for one of them. How does his world cope when secrets can be no more?</em> Based on a writing prompt and part of a series of Mario stories I was doing in 2018, consisting of ideals I'd never seen in a story. Here Mario and co try to live their lives, again in a world vaguely from Frenemies Forever, except they can read each other's mind. Well, almost all of them, leading to the twists and turns in store. Besides being a one shot, very atypical for me, its a Marioish save the princess plot, another thing I don't like to do normally. This never gained a ton of attention but liked the ideal and execution, and this was actually written out on paper before digital upload. I speak about it in author notes. -One shot.

			<ul>
			<li>In a weird way this is the Anti-Chemistry, a very 2019 story I'm quite fond of. Like Chemistry I was going all out for the ideal, not particularly concerned about how popular it would be. The plot has a low-key absurdity to it, with stakes so high yet not. The entire world goes along with the telepathy, society trying to adjust. It couldn't have went on forever due to lingering complications, but the more present conflict is the perpetrator trying to capitalize on his bizarre 'Alien Brain Wave' plan, pretending up until then to be one of the few scientists studying this matter.
			<li>This is the only story where I write Tatanga as a villain and I was still vacillating between if Prof. Gadd was a legitimate scientist of a wacky doctor, what I wouldn't settle on finally until Frenemies Forever 2 later. Dr. 'Drew' Toad is more or less the same morally ambiguous character you'll find in the Mario and Bowser series however. Luigi is also dating Daisy here and wanting to propose, when in other stories they are only friends or previously dated. Now getting away from those asides, this is self contained nicely with soft references, but largely no more included than what's needed. I made a few points with the ID card twist vague by unintentionally, but the closing author's note should help in that regard. </li>

	<p><em>Summary: Goombas were the last to join Bowser's army. (Fact) This however isn't. (Maybe)</em> Part of my 'experimental prompt' series sorta for 2018, this one-shot is based on the fact that goombas were the last enemy programmed for Super Mario Bros 1. Why? Koopa Troopas were thought to be a little too advanced for a brand new player, so the goombas that greet you first in this famous game were the last! Irony! This also creates, as I touch on in story, the narrative that the goombas were once with the Mushroom Kingdom but rebelled, an angle actual games after SMB1 don't touch on ever. Enjoy this short little story.</p>

	<p><em>Summary: Can Toad keep his head straight as he discovers new and weird alternate universes?</em> An unabashedly odd one of mine, four chapters that stretch from late 2016 to early 2019. Instead of being based on Super Paper Mario like the name implies, it's about Toad exploring alternate universes and trying to not lose his sanity. Despite all of that time, it does what it's doing well beyond the first chapter that's more of a teaser than anything and funny, even though this was more about me being experimental and provocative than 'comedic'.

			<li>I could never devote the time this story needed. We only have two alternate worlds, not counting the desertic area as introduced in the first chapter or what seems to be in the final, but isn't without giving it all away. Very seat of pants here, with whatever I thought worked, including the wacky ending reveal. The third chapter with it's twist I must say is one of my favorite things written honestly. What's also unique is that I referenced this (and Monster Mix-Up) not once, but twice in the original Frenemies Forever in a strange cross promotion of sorts. The last chapter had a handwritten version I based the web version on, something I was starting to do to at the time. Did that totally refine everything? Not really, but it's still cool to me.

We sorta have another 'Chemistry' here where I'm being topical and bold and somewhat snarky about Nintendo's interpretations, except here there's other experimental elements on display.

			<ul>
			<li>I thought this was a bit provocative at the time, and I think it's only gotten more so for poking fun at the ideal. Whatever! (Though I did play genderless toads straight in Frenemies Forever Redux without it being comedic- alas that is written by an older 'wisened' [yeah right] me) Now, while I don't care that much about the topic of headcanons and localization differences and Nintendo flip-flopping or  whatever, I like how I wrapped this one up without overly taking a stance outside the main character's thoughts and biases. No revolution came despite the world adjusting overnight to this new element (not unlike Psyche Out), but Toadette got her statement across and that's all that matters. Since this is contemporary with New Frenemy Adventure, I have Toadette dating Captain Toad. If you've read Frenemies Forever Redux (or even FF2), this might come off odd, but alas I hadn't evolved characterization to what those stories feature for the toads so it was fair game.

	<p><em>Summaries: Ludwig Von Koopa, master composer is making ridiculously dumb pop music? Is the greatest musician in Darkland now a sell out? Now how will he recover from his damaged reputation? -AND-  For the master composer, Ludwig Von Koopa, concerts are a way of life. But what about pop concerts? How will his friends and family take it? For music lovers!</em></p>
	
	<p>My works page hosts mostly the stories I'm proud of, so why are these rougher stories here instead of Personal Collections? Well, I am proud, sorta, concept wise at least. Ludwig is my favorite koopaling and I do love music. The Rhapsody story, loosely translating to 'Rhapsody of a Sell-out' was an early submission, with it's attempts at humor making a sensitive reviewer pop off. That was baffling, unexpected, and sorta funny at the time, but not where I really want to go with the concept of Ludwig going 'pop'.</p>
	
	<p>I created in 2017 the second story, a more affectionate take and a one shot that wraps itself up nicely. Check out where it began in <a href="FF1/Rhapsody.htm">Rhapsody Est Vendere</a> here. (Three chapters) Or the later, more refined <a href="FF1/LudwigWentpop.htm">Ludwig goes Pop</a> here. (One shot).</p> 
	
	<details>
		<summary>Click for more of my observations (may contain spoilers)</summary>

			<ul>
			<li>Let's start with Rhapsody. It has all the attributes of first year submissions from me, where I'm throwing out everything and seeing what sticks. I did like where it was trying to go with the conspiracy against Ludwig that crops up, but it's hit or miss, has a lot of real life references I don't like to do now, and understandably for the age (this was the FIRST fan fic I'd done with Koopalings), the characterization is different from later stories. Note that despite pop and dubstep and other popular genres were being jabbed at here, this clearly isn't me slamming what I hate or was annoyed with like Chemistry, but while demonstrating Iggy's insanity (another character trait I'd drop in other tales) I made fun of 'triggering' which appropriately triggered some guest reviewer. Quite an overreaction if you see the actual 'joke'.
			<li>Back to square one with Ludwig Goes Pop, with a conflict that's more internal than external, though Ludwig still faces some ribbing over his appreciation of less 'sophisticated' music genres. I put in extra backstory, toss in a few minor OCs to complete the picture and give it a happy ending. The only thing I'd change would be to not reference real songs and singers, just a pet peeve of mine. This being 2017 written though, that predates New Frenemy Adventure where I'd start parodying names and such. Anyway, enjoy! Being self contained ages it far better than Rhapsody.

Too bad once I picked it back up in the years after and I'd introduced some rising stakes, the motivation was gone. In the meantime, this has some good jokes without being too absurd and the references are super topical. This is one story where mentioning real life elements not only work but were necessary. Because it's so reliant of nostalgia to a particular era, it was always going to have a limited audience. Still, check it out.

It didn't go as far as I wanted and it's of a short story format, but I thought I made it interesting while it lasted. Being that it was written late 2018 to early 2019, it has that down to Earth tone I was adopting and would use for Frenemies Forever 2, rather than being so over the top like my 2018 stories were with their weirdness.

At the end of the day, this is a fish out of water story, Mario's introduction to the Mushroom Kingdom, one many other writers have done before. With me liking to be different, I hope you can see now how I fell off from the ideal.

<h3>Archived 11/16/23</h3>

<p><b>Old summary for Mario and Bowser: Frenemies Forever Redux when it was being rewritten:</b> This 2019 work was meant to tell the definite twisted tale of Mario and Bowser's frenemy ways and how this affects everyone around them. Like New Frenemy Adventure the start emulates Frenemies Forever yet again I subvert things. The new villain is reused from the above but most of the godlike powers are toned down so as to not have such an unbeatable threat. Many characters return but others don't or are under emphasized to keep the story lean and uncluttered. Emphasis was made on having a plot coherent from start to finish without too much distracting mystery. FF2 remains more mature, but this time instead of by gory or grim details, from the more grounded and dynamic characters going through more mature and grey area situations. The plenty of references return but in a way that doesn't rely on much knowledge of the other stories. Also fittingly for the final story, Mario and Bowser's relationship is set in stone forever- if that's not too much of a spoiler. Linked above is the story, completed though some edits continue into more recently, and the archive below has the internal author notes and trope page.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Overall improvements of writing, less typos, consistent devices used and characterization from start to finish
		<li>Partially due to grandfathering, all versions of the story (going back to the original FF1 and NFA) have weaker beginning sections. The Revise will finally give the start of the story the same care and depth the later chapters get.
		<li> In Redux, despite edits to mitigate, some character arcs set up go no where and now will have their full resolve without taking over (aka NFA)
		<li>Some new ideas and quirks can be added, again to flesh out characters and make the world fantastical yet believable. (Luigi's photography, <s>the idea that the Jewel of the Stars possesses Mario</s>, Mario and Bowser's feelings expounded greatly)

 <h3>*Update!* 8/4/21 (a bit wordy, see the TL;DR at bottom) </h3>
 
	<p>Hi again, it’s about time I explain what’s happening with The Mario Clash as a musical project. I’ve  planned two EPs, “H.A.A.E. ii v.2”  and “A Whole New Level”. The process however was.. not so smooth. Now I’m just gonna release the demos so far. Tracks that are my experiments from using new recording techniques and software. If you are unfamiliar, my old recording method was with Garageband on iOS. With no microphone I would use the tablet’s built in mic to record my live amps. Other effects including the drums would come from Garageband and nothing else. That’s some legitimately powerful and useful software but there were issues regardless and I wanted to produce better sounding live music- not necessarily studio recording level but free from the ordeals I dealt with in ‘BooTracker 3000’ (2016), Hand And Arm Exhaustion’ (2018) and very recently ‘Hand And Arm Exhaustion 2’ (2021). </p>
	
	<p>Now to the present time, I bought a Steinberg interface, Reaper for the PC, and a Shure SM57. Problem solved? In ways yes and no, bringing me to the current project. I wanted to rerecord some tracks from HAAE 2 that I just couldn’t get clean or tight enough along with a new ‘A Whole New Level’ EP that would have a new theme and style of song writing. </p>
	
	<p>The bad: I’m still learning the secrets of good production. No obstacle here but to practice and learn more. Also the drums frankly suck. On Garageband I was often playing the drums myself and that software has some good sounding drum samples. This certainly had it’s own issues considering I’m not really a drummer and did it all on a touch screen, but it had advantages of a better sound with no clipping and the freedom to change the feel and tempo on the spot. Now I’m using a free program called Hydrogen drum machine to create the drum tracks and then importing them into Reaper where I record the rest of the instruments. Hydrogen however has some awful stock sounds and not even that many packs to add and improve it. It also takes forever to do program certain things that aren’t strictly on grid. That may not be the programs fault but it is something I miss from Garageband where I was manually controlling the tempo. (Remember, I never quantize- ever!)  Reaper has a plethora of VSTs to use but of course some of the exact ones I was fond of in Garageband aren’t there, and substitutions are necessitated.  Again not really its fault. The last issue is so small but one that irritates me most. I can’t easily add album artwork like Garageband did. Windows is supposed to have several ways to do so without third-party software but none of them work!</p>
	
	<p>The good: Better recording quality, period. This goes for instruments, vocals, whatever.  I can now double track and mix without slowing down my system. (Previously I could only really pan the guitar one side and bass another. Trust me, anything else was too heavy for the iPad and/or turned into mud) I have much better live amps and equipment to work with too. </p>
	
	<p>Well, that sure seems like more bad than good does it? Actually a lot of that bad can be negated by me becoming more experienced with my new tools and finding alternatives, especially regarding drums. Because of that however I’m not ready to seriously release anything just yet. So now I present what I got so far via Google drive. But there is a little more to this still. For more details track by track, see the release way below under ‘H.A.A.E ii v.2/ A Whole New Level (Demo)’ </p>
	
	<p><b>TL;DR: I’m came pretty far with new equipment but still need time to work out the kinks and produce tracks to my new standard of quality.</b> </p>
