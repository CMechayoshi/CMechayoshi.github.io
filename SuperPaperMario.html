			<H1>Why Super Paper Mario is a 'true' Paper Mario game (Under Construction)</h1>
			
			<p>Paper Mario is a RPG offshoot of the Mario franchise spanning every home console starting with the Nintendo 64 in 2001. This series has had much derision from it’s fans for a number a reasons as the series evolved and one of the touchy subjects of the fandom even before Paper Mario Sticker Star changed the genre to action and adventure. Here we will discuss Super Paper Mario, the 2007 game for the Wii which removed turn based combat and instead presented a real time platform game hybrid. With all of those changes it might seem like a completely different game than the previous titles. While it is in ways, here are some things that make it a ‘true’ Paper Mario game, yes even moreso than the games after it that returned to turn based combat. I will keep this short and sweet, this is not a rant per say, just an comparative overview.</p>

<p>1. Story and Characters: Anyone familiar with Paper Mario knows that these are some of the few games where you really get to explore Mario’s world as if it’s a normal setting. (See the quote at the bottom of the homepage). You explore lands that are more than grass, desert, ice, etc and meet characters with backstories and unique designs. SPM starts with our castle getting whizzed away from the normal world because of completely new characters and you actually never come back. It might seem off to some, but creating new Ocs that aren’t directly ‘mario’ showed effort and commitment to the idea of the alternate dimension. The story goes back to past events with a villain with ‘complex’ (by Mario standards) emotions behind what he’s doing with an army with its own quirks. Interestingly, there are expies of returning characters like Merlon, etc, a neat bit.</p>

<p>2. Partners! SPM has them mechanically and technically but in a way that’s a little different. You have --- unique pixels that can do some of the basic utility functions previous partners had. One can tattle, one blows up, one makes Mario invulnerable while still, but they aren’t carbon copies. Slim makes Mario do the same thing that the curse would have in TTYD, what is more, Tippi who does the tattles stay outside the party along with the other pixels because she has a significant story role. You don’t hear about ‘partners’ much because outside of their intro they don’t speak and don’t really take the story role of previous partners, speaking for Mario. Some of this is justified because Mario isn’t the only protagonist but there could have been more dialogue from them in the game, especially since some efforts is made into giving them all some personality right before they officerly join you. They’re all ancient beings too, so think of the potential that was there!</p>

<p>3. Hub worlds and worlds: Hub worlds in the previous games are Toad Town and Rogueport, here we have Flipside complete with an inn, npcs, areas to explore, portals to the actual ‘chapter’ levels. The areas all have some sort of lore behind them, helped out somewhat by the locations being removed from the Mushroom Kingdom, at least in the second and third games. How does Sticker Star and Color Splash compare? Decalburg from Sticker Star has an item shop and the Sticker Fest stage that you can’t do much with and the area where you convert things into stickers. Port Prisma offers a little more, at least obstensibly with a bit more to look at but ultimately, it’s still not that much going on. The only residents are the Toads and you don’t really uncover more of it as you go along. In the worlds, there is sometimes towns within the ‘Chapters’ that SPM keeps (and the later games got rid of). These are just smaller hub worlds with more npcs and/ or quests and obstacles. </p>

<p>4. The shops, places to make recipes, badges or equivalents.: What would an RPG be without some sort of shop system? There are several in all three of the first game, each selling different things at different costs and different selling/trading costs as well. Sticker Star and later however only keep their shop (singular) arbitrarily. </p>

<p>5. The Pit of 100 trails: SPM actually included this from TTYD, with it’s own spin appropriate for the game play changes. Granted the game makes some questionable decisions forcing you to play it a little more than you should, but its still there as an optional thing. Later games had a prime opportunity since their battle systems depending on inventory management, but they don’t. </p>
<p>6. Unique bosses: The games have unique characters as the bosses that are more than just ‘enemy’ but bigger. </p>
<p>7. Action Commands: These are button inputs the player is encouraged greatly to use to increase the effectiveness (or have any effect at all) on when executing a move in battle. Super Paper Mario was real time, but still involved action commands for certain times and a few when jumping on an enemy. These moves return in the next games but are reduced only to pressing the A button at the right time, whereas before the commands were multiple buttons or even gestures.</p>
<p> 7. Enemies and tattle log system: This is hardly brought up, yet I think it’s a huge thing really. Tattling in these games is when you use your partner, always the first one you obtain to ‘tattle’ on the enemy, revealing some details about them and their stats. Tippi does something similar here and also this game has Catch Cards that you collect for every enemy and even non-enemies doing the same thing and even granting you more damage against the enemy. Sticker Star has this feature absent completely, perhaps because enemy’s hp bars are combined, but still you are given no easy way to know an enemy’s attack, defense, and more. Color Splash has select cards of a few foes but they actually act as temporary partners or instantly scare way enemies in battle. Overall, both games skip over this feature with only a museum to sort of make up for it. There you are to collect all of the stickers in the game at least once to donate it, but doing this takes away stickers/ cards you sometimes need whereas tattling was always a ‘free’ action in the previous games and it’s not nearly as satisfying at that.</p>
