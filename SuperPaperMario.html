<p>Paper Mario is a RPG or turn-based adventure spinoff of the Mario franchise starting on the Nintendo 64 in 2001. To this day every entry introduces new settings, characters, and mechanics, often to much derision from fans. One game controversial from the start, even before Paper Mario: Sticker Star, was Super Paper Mario. This article will discuss reasons I think this platormer RPG hybrid is often unfairly treated in comparison to the games preceding it and succeeding it.</p>

</ul>




<a id="SPM">
<p><b>1.Story, Characters, and themeing</b>: Part of the appeal of Paper Mario among fans is that these games give Mario a better story than usual and more fleshed out and unique characters. The point here is not to go on and on on whether or not Mario needs original characters sharing the space or taking the spotlight (depending on how you feel about them), but I will point out that Super Paper Mario easily fits right in with the preceding games. Here Mario and a few other main characters are stuck in an alternate dimension separate from the Mushroom Kingdom with new characters and a new league of villains with their own quirks. There is again a prophesy type backstory that connects the main cast. Interestingly, there are expies of returning characters like Merlon, Merlee, etc, a neat bit.</p>

<p> Theme wise all early Paper Mario games had elements of fantasy to them. More fantasy than normal I mean, as Mario's world is zany even in a bog-standard game. Paper Mario is a Bowser kidnap Peach story but it has the Star Spirits and the concept of wishes. The Thousand Year Door is a Peach kidnap tail as well only not from Bowser and it has the Crystal Stars, the ancient lore of Rougeport, plus the Shadow Queen, plus the Four Heroes, plus well...there's quite a bit there. Super Paper Mario starts out with a wedding.. Count Bleck marries Bowser and Peach and it's all down from there. I will not retell the story, it's not perfect but whether you enjoyed it or not effort was put into it and that aligns with the first two games. </p>

<p><b>2.Partners!</b> SPM has plenty at least mechanically... There are twelve in a half unique pixels that can do some of the basic utility functions previous Paper Mario partners had. They are "a type of fairy" like beings Tippi will tell you at some point. They do various tasks, revealing objects,  blowing up, making your character invulnerable while motionless, making Mario move quicker, etc. Some abilities are brand new. Like other games some are male and female but unlike those it's not obvious by design, only name. So that's another point of interest. Let's break it down:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Tippi: Mysterious at first but important character, at least at first. Resembling a butterfly, she tattles on foes and gives hints but not because she's a student like Goombario or Goombella. Instead she's.. actually much older and other backstory reasons etc etc. A unique to this game she's with you by default so you can still use other pixels and your own character's abilities at the same time. Equivalent to: Goombario, Goombella
	
	<li>Thoreau: Apparently a posh but hardy guy who looks like an abstract five digited hand. He allows you to pick up and throw some enemies and objects. He doesn't really have a direct partner equivalent. Thrown enemies pierce defense so it calls to mind Yoshi's TTYD Gulp attack. 
	
	<li>Boomer: Excitable bomb, who looks the job too. He may be dropped anytime for a controlled explosion. Equivalent to: Bombette, Admiral Bobbery
	
	<li>Slim: A Southern pixel. He is a triangle shape pointing down. Not too sure of the design physiology there but I guess he implies minimizing. He allows the character to go paper thin and evade attack at the cost of needing to stay still. Equivalent to: The curse in TTYD, Lady Bow (sorta), Vivian (sorta)
	
	<li>Thudley: A pixel that resembles a weight. He allows you to ground pound with any character. Equivalent to: the boot upgrades
	
	<li>Carrie: A pixel that allows you to tred dangerous ground. She resembles an unfolded box. Combined with Bowser she's also game breaking supposidely. Equivalent to: Lakilester, Parakarry, Yoshi
	
	<li>Fleep: A pixel likes to sing in bathrooms and allows you to dazzle enemies and reveal secrets. His design calls to mind a retractable window shade. If used on a Mr. I type enemy it is an insta defeat because they are weak to spinning around (like Super Mario 64). He can't be used in 3D with Mario however. Equivalent to: Watt, Madam Flurrie, Mrs. Mowz
	
	<li>Cudge: A hammer pixel that will proudly shout whatever you want to the heavens! He allows any character to use a hammer. Equivalent to: Mario's hammer
	
	<li>Dottie: A mellow pixel allows you to shrink. Her design kind of implies something larger getting smaller, but it's highly stylized I must say. Enemies won't see you but you can still attack them. You can also access certain places in this state.
	
	<li>Barry: A pixel that hides out for most of the game, then hops onboard. He creates a barrier around the character to protect you and harm enemies in direct contact. He resembles the spiky shield that surrounds you upon using his ability. Equivalent: Mario's super guard
	
	<li>Dashell: A pixel that's been stuck in the Pit of 100 Trials for like forever. Seriously help him. Anyway he allows the player to move faster. Useful for backtracking. His design I suppose is an arrow in motion since his 'wings' are always behind him. Equivalent to: Lakilester (kinda), Yoshi(kinda)
	
	<li>Piccolo: An other optional pixel that changes the music on command and makes a certain boss very easily. She resembles a music note. There's no direct equivalent.
	
	<li>Tiptron: A robotic pixel programmed by boss Francis believe she's Tippi. She's both a gameplay convenience since Tippi is lost from beating the game and a character that somewhere deep down realizes she's just a copy of something...
	
</ul>


<p>So to conclude, Super Paper Mario reuses some old abilities but adds a few more. Abilities never used: No one shoots a shell out like Kooper or Koops. No one allows swimming like Sushie. Justified because in this game Mario and co can swim natively. Additionally Peach, Bowser, and Luigi add their own skills to the mix.</p>


<p><b>3. Hub worlds and chapters:</b> Flipside/Flopside has the 'classic' Paper Mario commonalities, an inn, npcs, areas to explore that gradually open up, shops, and portals to the chapter levels. The levels all have lore behind them, helped out somewhat by the locations being removed from the Mushroom Kingdom. In the worlds there are sometimes towns within the ‘Chapters’, smaller hubs. These have less going on compared to previous games due to the 2-D perspective, but they exist.</p>

<p><b>4. The shops, places to make recipes, badges or equivalents.:</b> What would an RPG be without some sort of shop system? There are several in all three of the first games, each selling different things at different costs and accepting buybacks at various rates. Initially you can cook with a single item but then the player is allowed to combine items for more complex recipes. There are two cooks with different catalogs, Saffron and Dyllis. As in PM64 and TTYD there is some work involved filling out all recipes for max completion. SPM lacks badges, but the collectible Catch Cards are a near equivalent. In addition of behaving as a bestiary they make you do extra damage on the enemy.</p>

<p><b>5. The Pit of 100 trails and other challenges:</b> Super Paper Mario includes this from TTYD with it’s own spin appropriate for the game play changes. The developers were so proud you have to play it up to three times. Instead of being locked in a room with a single enemy (as it appears on the field) to defeat before moving, the player is dunked into a dungeon with varying amounts of foes. One of them has the key needed to escape and you are timed on the floor. Tied to randomness but exciting nonetheless, the key could be within the very first or very last enemy defeated. The harder Flopside version introduces 'dark' enemies who are only silhouettes. Unlike TTYD's version, there's no foreboding or dreadful feel the deeper you get and the boss(es) are a let down. There is a similar on principle Sammer challenge, very strenuous and repetitive but offering reward. </p>

<p><b>6. Unique bosses:</b> The first two games have unique characters as the bosses that are more than just ‘enemy' but bigger. There are some repeat battles in both but for the most part they change it up enough or at the very least feel progressively harder. Super Paper Mario also has its slew of bad guys but unfortunately doesn't do so well with the repeat fights. Some are justified because they are Count Bleck's mooks, but they out number original boss fights in the game. The game doesn't make them feel like fresh battles and if it is someone unique, they feel like a clone of a previous boss. That being said, they are still unique characters and not generic enemies.</p>

<p><b>7. Action Commands and RPG mechanics:</b> Often the player is greatly encouraged to use to button inputs to increase the effectiveness (or have any effect at all) when executing a move in battle. Super Paper Mario is real time, but items can require these by pressing something or shaking the remote. 'Stylish' moves can be executed after jumping on enemies. Some paper cut out audience members will pop on screen just for a visual effect.</p>

	<img src="images/800px-SPM_Blobule_Stylish.png" alt="the Super Paper Mario audience that shouldn't be">
	<p style="text-align:center"><em>The audience doesn't make sense here, I mean, where are their helmets??</em></p>
	
<p>Moving on, HP and ATTK carry over and increases from points leveling up. That's your 'experience'. Defense doesn't really however.. Mario can flip to 3-D as a selling point. A lot of puzzles just come down to flipping so that's all we'll say about that.  Despite this, we can see the attempt to adapt old Paper Mario customs to the new type of game SPM was.</p>

<p><b>7. Enemies and tattle log system:</b> SPM has an eclectic bunch. Like previous games they have different colored variants with the most elite enemy that's entirely blacked out. The Mario enemies are a bit basic and related directly to Bowser as they have been brainwashed by Bleck (also indicated by the sun glasses on koopas). The native Flopside enemies are colorful and diverse but hit and miss. I appreciate some being abstract and interesting, but many are a little too out there for for typical Mario fan. </p>

<p>If there is an area Super Paper Mario does not skimp on it is the Paper Mario bestiary. Tippi gives information by tattling but so do Catch Cards that you collect for every enemy and even NPCs. The catch card entry differs from Tippi's commentary. Collecting all of the cards is a a mighty task but they throw in characters from previous Paper Mario games as cameos.</p>

		<p style="text-align:center"><em>The only Toad in the game.</em></p>
		
<p><b>0. Music:</b> I didn't know where to place this because my opinion is all over the place regarding Paper Mario's music. I think the series has some hits, especially in the first game which is stronger even than TTYD to me in the music department. SPM is overall okay but I am not moved by a much of it either. Flopside's town music sure drones and gets in your head, but not quite like Rogueport. A few songs annoy me a little however, the theme songs of pixels joining you, the mellow one that plays during an important story part, and a couple of other things. Now if my opinion of SPM music is mostly okay, why didn't I give it a number on the list? Because this is one area where successors Sticker Star and Color Splash actually improve. It is often said that one redeeming factor of those games is their great soundtracks and I'm afraid I have to agree..</p>

<p>Super Paper Mario is oft blamed for what happens next with the franchise and it's not entirely faultless. It removed Mario and co out of their natural elements and pulled a 'story over gameplay' move that wasn't going to do down well to a lot of Mario fans. I won't go into how there was a back and forth with Miyamoto over if there needed to be a story from that point on, or the results of a Club Nintendo poll. Instead we're going to remain objective as we can and give credit to the newer games where its due. Let's evaluate them like before:</p>


<p><b>Story, Characters, and themeing:</b>Sticker Star is rather infamous for it's dry plot and cast. There is a Sticker Fest happening, a completely new event with no background until now. Bowser is able to somehow sneak up to the Sticker Comet that grants wishes. (A lot of things in Mario's world does this it seems.) The comet breaks into Royal Stickers that scatter the land and inadvertently create bosses you'll have to fight later. Kersti is the caretaker of these Royal Stickers and she becomes your second protagonist for the adventure. She has a strong personality and will even butt heads with Mario though she always comes around. While Bowser and Peach are off in a castle you face several foes that were under normal circumstances typical but become powerful shiny stickers with lots of HP once they get a hold of that Royal Sticker. Bowser Jr and Kamek appear to torture you as well when they can. There aren't really any OCs or at least named ones, and what little we get is restricted to a few levels. They are disproportionately similar looking toads. The themes are a little New Super Mario Bros-ish as some may criticize and veer more on the regular fantastical Mario settings rather than the more fantasy settings from before. For instance, there is no talk of prophesy here nor backstory, even in a few spots where you think there would be. The closest we get is the fact that in this game only (as you'll see) the people (or toads at least) of Mario's world have no clue what non-paper real-world objects are. That's why they're 'Things'. Maybe it's meant to be a gag for reading the museum entries but this conflicts with world building as characters like Goomblla from TTYD exist still?

<p>Contrary to popular belief, the thing I'm going to defend the most here is.. Kersti! But just a little. Her treatment of Mario was at times rude and she is too quick to run her mouth but she does realize she is wrong and things like that make a character a character. Let me explain! It seems a lot worse because she is the only companion. In a colorful cast to balance out her attitude, I don't think nearly as many would find fault with her. It's okay for someone to not kiss Mario's feet constantly. What's not okay is that her ability to give hints doesn't help with some of the guessing game puzzles here.</p>

<p><b>Hub Worlds:</b>Sticker Star and Color Splash compare? They do worse even with 3-D on their side. Decalburg from Sticker Star has an item shop, the Sticker Fest stage that you can’t do much with, and the area where you convert things into stickers. Port Prisma offers a little more ostensibly, but it’s still not that much going on. The only residents are the Toads and the size is smaller. Those games have a different structure so it's not completely fair to compare, still the comparison was brought out to prove that SPM is closer to the first the games than the later.</p>


<p>Later games had a prime opportunity for this sort of challenge since their battle systems depended on inventory management, but Sticker Star and Color Splash don’t even try. Origami King has a boss rush mode but they regulate your health and items. They were so close...</p>


<p> Sticker Star has this feature absent completely, perhaps because enemy’s hp bars are combined. Because of this there is no in game way to know an enemy’s attack, defense, and more. Color Splash has select cards of a few foes but they behave as temporary partners. Overall, those games skip over this feature with only a museum to make up for it.</p>
