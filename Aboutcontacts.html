<h1>About me *updated*:</h1>

	<p>You can call me C.Mechayoshi. Of course my actual name is plainly on this site if you know where to look.. My primary interests are gaming, reading, writing, music, and technology. From there it narrows considerably, to my devotion to Mario for two decades and counting, to how I like Sherlock Holmes and have read every story and some parodies and pastiche as well, how I'm into playing and listening to heavy music,  how I like old analog technology like mechanical watches and modern things such as aviation, etc...</p>
	
	<p>My principles are as so: Lost material is unacceptable to me, so I try to archive everything, even seemingly unimportant things. I dislike censorship and I dislike the plain and boring in favor of things that might challenge you or even be a little provocative. Don't confuse it with being wanton or insensitive. I can be opinionated, but not a blowhard over it! To move to a less dicey subject, I am often galvanized to act when there is a need. <em>There wasn't any full guide coverage of the Nintendo Adventure Books, so I did it for instance.</em> Like that. Many of my ideals in general, particularly creative wise, are odd ones. I like to be different. As far as other projects go, you'll see me work hard to consolidate scattered information on the internet. My Jackson and Charvel database is an excellent example, pulling from, besides my own hours of research, places on the internet where the information is buried or in danger of becoming offline entirely. (Particularly when the information comes from dying forums) </p>
	
	<p>In conclusion, mechas64castles.net was created off of the foundation of my boomaster-amia (Now under Mecha Nintendo Master) Tumblr linked below. There I wrote quick articles about Nintendo and  sought out other blogs covering unconventional topics I deemed 'Mario oddities'. While I have problems with tumblr, that's not really the point here. It was obvious that for some of the more involved ideals a blog format wouldn't be appropriate. You've certainly noticed everything here is a bit 'old school'. My site is sculpted around, well incompetence sometimes, but also a desire to capture the state of the web during the 00s, where I discovered that I could log on a computer and browse gaming and hobbyist fan sites of yore. </p>
	
	<p><em>Fun fact: the name of this site is a slight reference to themushroomkingdom.net!</em></p>
	
	<h2>My gaming history:</h2>

<p>Growing up early on I had a Windows 98 computer and played plenty a edutainment game. It could not handle 3D stuff of course. Around 2003 I visited some relatives who happened to own a jungle green Nintendo 64. I knew about console games as some of my other relatives possessed the at the time new and fancy Sony Playstation 2. That was the ‘cooler’ console to own then, that and the Xbox for the more mature (or ostensibly so) library of games and because it meant you didn’t need a DVD player. About that same year I was gifted a Playstation 1 Slim and a few games. (Un)fortunately I was already hooked on Mario 64 and Donkey Kong 64 as my new favorite franchises from playing with my cousins.</p>

<p> I was convinced I wanted a N64 despite it being outdated by then. Soon I was given a Gameboy Advance SP  by relatives. A brochure with it advertised Mario and Luigi SuperStar Saga. This was the first time I discovered Luigi for instance, who I then mistakenly thought was the older brother due to height. I would consider that Gameboy my true entry into Nintendo fandom as it allowed me to play the ports of the Super Mario platforms games and the Donkey Kong Country games. <em>Yes, I was a 'girl gamer' from then on.</em> Soon I acquired a Gamecube and from that point on I was strictly team Nintendo, even despite it’s more nerdy stigma among my 00s peers. I acquired an subscription to Nintendo Power late 2006 and was subscribed until the magazines cancellation. I continue to own mostly Nintendo systems and play first party games.</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.last.fm/user/Mechayoshi">Last.fm</a> Warning, a hot mess since I first left it alone around 2016. The scrobbles you see are not super accurate, plus a lot was lost. Still, the account is about as old as my youtube one, so for archival's sake..</p>
		
		<p><a href="https://www.deviantart.com/mechayoshi/gallery">Deviantart</a> Again, warning, well, not so strong of one, as it hasn't went to the crap exactly since my leaving it, but it's not indicative of me now either way. This is where Mechayoshi as a username originates, inspired by a now deleted deviantartist named 'Mecha Bowser'. I left since the redesign years ago now. FYI something being in the 'favorites' folder is more or less a 'remember this' folder, not a 'I actually like this' folder. </p>
