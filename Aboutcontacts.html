	<p>You can call me C.Mechayoshi. Of course my actual name is plainly on this site if you know where to look.. My primary interests are gaming, reading, writing, music, and technology, or at least highly specific things that generally fall into those categories. Think certain game series, certain book series, some types of music, niche forms of tech or gadgetry, etc...</p>
	
	<p>My principles are as so: Lost material is unacceptable to me, so I try to archive everything, even seemingly unimportant things. I dislike censorship and I dislike the plain and boring in favor of things that might challenge you or even be a little provocative. Don't confuse it with being wanton or insensitive. I can be opinionated, but not a blowhard over it! I am often galvanized to act when there is a need. Example: There wasn't any extensive coverage of the Nintendo Adventure Books so that became by first big project, besides documenting Charvels and Jacksons, where information was dubious, buried, or scattered across the internet on old or dying websites. Many of my creative ideas are odd ones I know. As far as other projects go, you'll see me work hard to consolidate highly specific information on the internet and speak about whatever else I'm passionate about. That's just how I roll.</p>
	
	<p>In conclusion, mechas64castles.net was created off of the foundation of my boomaster-amia (Now under Mecha Nintendo Master) blog c. 2014. I had a screenshot series 'Stuff Gamefaqs Says', which just reposted funny comments on the message boards, I wrote quick articles regarding weird or funny Mario subjects, sometimes dumped drafts fan-fiction, gave commentary in general on upcoming games, and interacted with a fanbase that was, at the time, getting a little rocky. In case you are wondering, I left before the 'big tumblr incident', so my move to a dedicated website was all about having a permanent spot on the web and full ownership of what I put out there. You've certainly noticed everything here is a bit 'old school'. My site is sculpted around, well, incompetence sometimes, but also a desire to capture the state of the web during the 00s, where I first discovered that I could log on a computer and browse gaming and hobbyist fan sites of yore. </p>
	
	<p><em>Fun fact: the name of this site is a slight reference to themushroomkingdom.net!</em></p>
	
	<h2>My gaming history:</h2>

<p>Growing up early on I had a Windows 98 computer and played plenty a edutainment game. It could not handle 3D stuff of course. Around 2003 I visited some relatives who happened to own a jungle green Nintendo 64. I knew about console games as some of my other relatives possessed the at the time new and fancy Sony Playstation 2. That was the ‘cooler’ console to own then, that and the Xbox for the more mature (or ostensibly so) library of games and because it meant you didn’t need a DVD player. About that same year I was gifted a Playstation 1 Slim and a few games. (Un)fortunately I was already hooked on Mario 64 and Donkey Kong 64 as my new favorite franchises from playing with my cousins.</p>

<p> I was convinced I wanted a N64 despite it being outdated by then. Soon I was given a Gameboy Advance SP  by relatives. A brochure with it advertised Mario and Luigi SuperStar Saga. This was the first time I discovered Luigi for instance, who I then mistakenly thought was the older brother due to height. I would consider that Gameboy my true entry into Nintendo fandom as it allowed me to play the ports of the Super Mario platforms games and the Donkey Kong Country games. <em>Yes, I was a 'girl gamer' from then on.</em> Soon I acquired a Gamecube and from that point on I was strictly team Nintendo, even despite it’s more nerdy stigma among my 00s peers. I acquired an subscription to Nintendo Power late 2006 and was subscribed until the magazines cancellation. I continue to own mostly Nintendo systems and play first party games.</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.last.fm/user/Mechayoshi">Last.fm</a> Warning, a hot mess since I first left it alone around 2016. The scrobbles you see are not super accurate, plus a lot was lost. Still, the account is about as old as my youtube one, so for archival sake..</p>
		
		<p><a href="https://www.deviantart.com/mechayoshi/gallery">Deviantart</a> Again, warning, well, not so strong of one, as it hasn't went to the crap exactly since my leaving it, but it's not indicative of me now either way. This is where Mechayoshi as a username originates, inspired by a now deleted deviantartist named 'Mecha Bowser'. I left since the redesign years ago now. FYI something being in the 'favorites' folder is more or less a 'remember this' folder, not a 'I actually like this' folder. </p>
