	<p>You can call me C.Mechayoshi. Of course my actual name is plainly on this site if you know where to look.. I am passionate about gaming, reading, writing, music, and technology, or at least niche things that generally fall into those categories. My principles are as so: Archive everything, censorship is wrong always, reject the plain and even be a little provocative. No, this isn't about being wanton or insensitive, it's about challenging ideas or at least revisiting why you feel a certain way. That's how we all grow and learn. If there is a need, I am galvanized to act. Examples: There wasn't any extensive coverage of the Nintendo Adventure Books short of people's reviews, so I set about creating maps for them. I was into guitar playing but noticed that old Charvels and Jacksons were mysterious, information scattered around websites that were outdated or dying. Someone needed to consolidate it all so I did.</p>
	
	<h2>My mission:</h2>
	
	<p>I'm kidding, but anyway the purpose of this site is to host all of my projects in a permanent place. It began with my Tumblr blog around 2014, which was doomed from the start. To use the site 'properly' one's page will be full of reblogged content, and that was far too messy for me. I didn't want to run multiple for the clashing categories of what I do either. Lastly my posts short of the humorous ones or the 'Stuff Gamefaqs Says' series weren't meant to be propagated necessarily like art or memes or whatever. They were merely informative, like the 'Mario Oddities' I imported first. I decided to refresh my high school HTML and build whatever this is now. You've certainly noticed it's old school. Mechas64castles is sculpted around, well, incompetence sometimes, but also a desire to capture the state of the web during the 00s, where I first discovered that I could log on a computer and browse gaming and hobbyist fan sites of yore. <em>Fun fact: I chose a .net as reference to themushroomkingdom.net.</em></p>
	
	<h2>My gaming history:</h2>

<p>Growing up early on I had a Windows 98 computer and played plenty an edutainment game. It could not handle 3D stuff. Around 2003 I visited some relatives who happened to own a jungle green Nintendo 64. I knew about console games as some of my other relatives possessed the at the time new and fancy Sony Playstation 2. That was the ‘cooler’ console to own then, that and the Xbox for the more mature (or ostensibly so) library of games and because it meant you didn’t need a DVD player. About that same year I was gifted a Playstation 1 Slim and a few games. (Un)fortunately I was already hooked on Mario 64 and Donkey Kong 64 as my new favorite franchises from playing with my cousins.</p>

<p> I was convinced I wanted a N64, though I was given a Gameboy Advance SP  by relatives. A brochure with it advertised Mario and Luigi SuperStar Saga. This was the first time I discovered Luigi for instance, who I then mistakenly thought was the older brother due to height. I would consider that Gameboy my true entry into Nintendo fandom as it allowed me to play the ports of Super Mario and Donkey Kong Country games. I was a 'girl gamer' from then on!.. Anyway, I acquired a Gamecube, ignoring it's unpopularity and a subscription to Nintendo Power late 2006. I was subscribed until the magazine's cancellation. Funnily enough it was a Sony PSP that got me into retro gaming via emulators, though I soon started to collect the real things. Even though now I've branched out considerably, I continue to own mostly Nintendo systems and play first party games, or at least the kind of franchise that would be prominent in pre-Ultimate Smash Bros..</p>
