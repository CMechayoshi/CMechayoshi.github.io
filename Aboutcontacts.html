	<h2>About me:</h2>

	<p>You can call me C.Mechayoshi. Of course my actual name is plainly somewhere on this site if you know where to look.. I am into gaming, gadgets, writing, reading, mechanical watches, technology, music, and fountain pens. I document Jackson and Charvel musical instruments. I am a Mario fanatic. I do not like the concept of things being lost forever so I try to archive materials, even seemingly unimportant ones. I usually will not bother with something if someone else has already done it first. I will take a stab at it if I think I have something original or a twist of some sort to add to it. That in fact becomes my motivation to press on through sometimes tedious work.</p>
	
	<p>This website was created off of the foundation of my boomaster-amia Tumblr linked below. There I wrote quick articles about Nintendo and  sought out other blogs covering unconventional topics I deemed 'Mario oddities'. I never found appealing the layout and structure of Tumblr so I realized a dedicated website would be a better place. On this site you may observe that I try to cover things others have not done- at least well enough in my opinion. For instance I’m not the first to document Charvel and Jackson instruments but I’m certainly one of the few to list so much information in one relatively easy to access spot. I'm also the only I know to cover in detail the paths of the Nintendo Adventure Books series. My other articles also hold unique surprises. You may notice, this site is a bit 'old school'. My html skills are rudimentary and I admit I focus more on rapidly uploading content than making things fancy. I will make mechas64castles better looking in the future.</p>
	
	<p><em>Fun fact: the name of this site is a slight reference to themushroomkingdom.net, an old school Mario fansite that I had fond memories of when younger.</em> Now if you really still care, there is some more personal info below.</p>
	
	<h2>My gaming history:</h2>

<p>Growing up early on I wasn’t hugely into gaming and only knew what I might see from advertisements.  I had a Windows 98 computer in the early 00s and played a number of educational games my dad purchased out of catalogs. I found titles such as the Putt-Putt series, Freddi Fish, Sesame Street, NASCAR pinball, Tonka and a few others quite fun. Our Compaq PC could not however run any 3D games of course. Around 2003 I visited some relatives who happened to own a jungle green Nintendo 64. I knew about console games as some of my other relatives possessed the at the time new and fancy Sony Playstation 2. That was the ‘cooler’ console to own then, that and the Xbox for the more mature (or ostensibly so) library of games and because it meant you didn’t need a DVD player. About that same year I was gifted a Playstation 1 Slim and a few games. (Un)fortunately I was already hooked on Mario 64 and Donkey Kong 64 as my new favorite franchises from playing with my cousins.</p>

<p> I was convinced I wanted a N64 despite it being outdated by then. Soon I was given a Gameboy Advance SP  by relatives. A brochure with it advertised Mario and Luigi SuperStar Saga. This was the first time I discovered Luigi, who I then mistakenly thought was the older brother due to height. I would consider that Gameboy my true entry into Nintendo fandom as it allowed me to play the ports of the Super Mario platforms games and the Donkey Kong Country games. Soon I acquired a Gamecube and from that point on I was strictly team Nintendo, even despite it’s more nerdy stigma among my 00s peers. I acquired an subscription to Nintendo Power late 2006 and was subscribed until the magazines cancellation. I continue to own mostly Nintendo systems and play first party games.</p>
