	<p>This article will focus on Mario games available multiple consoles because I find the occurrence uncommon yet interesting. This will not count re-releases (such as Mario Kart 8 vs Deluxe) and of course not Virtual Console (or emulation, ha!). </p>

	<p>Mario's Missing: The infamous early game where Luigi takes center stage. This game from 1993 was on the NES, SNES, PC, and later Mac. Nintendo of course on licenced the characters so you know this will be a fun one.. The plot involves Bowser trying to flood the EARTH. (Yes. The real world.) However to do so, he needs a multitude of hairdryers and to buy that he has his minions travel all over the world to steal landmarks to sell. (Convoluted but works I guess..) </p>

	<p>Mario and co follow Bowser to stop him and while details vary between versions, the end result will be Mario getting captured so that Luigi must save the day. Interesting notes is that Brooklyn is mentioned as being the Mario bro’s home, a rare instance of that location showing up in a game rather than other media.

	<p>The game play is a ‘side-walk-scroller’, get it? Well, you traverse the metropolitan streets and look both ways before crossing, all in the hunt for Koopa Troopas with artifacts. It's "educational" in the sense that you must put artifacts were they belong based off of their real world location. That is why the ‘curators’ are there to quiz and accept the items, though, again, exact details vary. Luigi has to call Yoshi to even get out of the level he’s in, or the exit will be blocked but to do that, you need to know what city you are in. No, it’s not as easy as simply looking. Secure the cities and sometimes ‘fight’ Koopalings to win and then have an ending with Bower that’s different for every version.</p>

	<p>In short, it’s a fascinating game to me, just not a good one in gameplay or education considering it’s known errors. The only reason I assume it was multi-platform in the first place was because it was always a cheap game and they wanted to maximize profit. That doesn’t however explain the CD-ROM deluxe version that updates some things and adds voice acting</p>
