	<h1>Mario Oddities: Mario Discovery Series</h1>

	<p>Not many know about the Mario  Discovery spinoff series. There were five educational games by The Software Toolworks, only being licensed by Nintendo.
	While Mario is Missing and Mario's Time Machine are the most well known ones there are others. These were also multi-platform. See below for details.</p>

<h2>Mario is Missing (1993)</h2>


	<img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/7ff08d1a37b7e7efb85dab50ff4f53e3/tumblr_inline_pk9jenmKYn1swwy4v_500.jpg">
		<p style="text-align:center"><em>Too cool for Mario</em></p>
	

	<p>The infamous 1993 game where Luigi takes center stage on the NES, SNES, PC, and later Mac. Nintendo only licensed the characters so you know this will be a fun one.. For the plot Bowser tries to flood the EARTH. (Yes, explicitly the real world.) However to do so he needs a grand amount of hairdryers and to afford such he uses his minions to travel all over the world and steal landmarks to sell. Let's stop here for a moment, how are they selling these landmarks? Private auction? Furthermore if it becomes known that Bowser's fundraiser is to doom the planet, I don't believe there would be many takers. We haven't even touched on how some of the landmarks can't really be stolen in the first place.</p>

	<p>Mario and co follow Bowser to stop him and while details vary between versions, the end result will be Mario getting captured so that Luigi must save the day. Interesting notes is that Brooklyn is mentioned in the manual <a href="https://themushroomkingdom.net/manuals/mim-snes.txt">(here)</a>, so the game makers were influenced by the cartoons and/or the general accepted pre-Yoshi's Island Mario bros origin.</p>

	<img src="http://www.mariowiki.com/images/b/b6/MIM-Globulator_Map.png">
	<p style="text-align:center"><em>We zoomed way out on Google Maps just for you!</em></p>
	

	<p>This is a ‘side-walk-scroller’, get it? You traverse the streets and look both ways before crossing, all on the hunt for clues and Koopa Troopas with stolen artifacts. It's "educational" in the sense that you must put artifacts were they belong based off of their real world location. That is why the ‘curators' are there to quiz you
	and accept the items. Luigi has to call Yoshi once he knows where he is and to get out of the level or the exit will be blocked. Unfortunately the adventure is not as easy as simply looking at the scenery to know where you are, nor can just ask a local point blank where the heck you are like a tourist would in a realistic situation. Once you have sleuthed  it up, secure the cities and move on through Bowser's castle and occasionally fight Koopalings that may or may not have voice actors depending on version. There is a password system to save some progress.</p>

	<p>In short, it’s a well, it's different and fascinating game to me in way. Of course that doesn't translate to a super great game however. It's just not that great gameplay or 
	education wise considering its known errors and repetitive nature. </p>

	<ul>
		<li>Bowser's Koopas have somehow stolen items that are ridiculous even by Mario standards like entire buildings. A simple change could have made
		this less silly. What if they were only threatening to destroy locations or where holding them hostage? The manual linked above mentions them "trashing"
		locations not sticking them in their pockets so obviously a memo got missed between the story and game department.
		<li>Boss fights are in name only. Bosses don't HURT YOU!
		<li>Art style is all over the place even in the console versions. I understand that the DOS or computer variants draw their own uncanny looking sprites
		but the SNES for example mixes Super Mario World with ugly off model specimens.
		<li>A lot of cities look the same. The computer versions offer real images which is nice however. Also, some effort is put into making music vary slightly by location.
		<li>Minor, but the point system doesn't do anything.
		<li>The way the Super Mario World real world map looks is actually pretty cool.
		<li>A CD deluxe version adds more voice acting and also realistic photos and video clips.

<h2>Mario's Time Machine (1993)</h2>

	<img src="https://www.mariowiki.com/images/a/a8/Mario%27s_Time_Machine_Box_Art.jpg" alt="snes box art">
			<p style="text-align:center"><em>Out of this world!</em></p>
			
	<p>We have a treat here, different plots depending on the version:</p>
	
	
	<p><b>DOS and SNES version:</b> <a href="https://www.gamesdatabase.org/Media/SYSTEM/Nintendo_SNES//Manual/formated/Mario-s_Time_Machine_-_1993_-_Software_Toolworks,_Inc.,_The.pdf">(Manual here)</a> Bowser is stealing valuable stuff again it seems only now he's messing with history via the ‘Timulator’. Bowser wants it partly for a fancy personal museum in his castle, but also to send the world back into the Dark Ages upon destroying the Timulator as the console manuals reveal. The implication is that if the artifacts aren't returned that will irreversibly change the past. Sure. But.. the fact that a monstrous koopa stole them and a plumber returned them has already altered the past. You'd think a history book or two would at least have that curious thing as a foot mark. I digress. Mario has to get in the castle to return the items to their proper place. Notably Mario has narration and the music isn’t half bad.</p>
	
	<p>For gameplay you pick an item, a location, and a time. I feel this is asking quite a lot if you are just jumping in. Then are sent to a surfing mini-game(using Mode 7 on SNES) called the fabric of time where you need to pick up mushrooms and then hit a whirlpool. Now you are in whatever historical place you need to be. Return the item by completing the tasks there. To figure out information needed you’ll need to talk around like in Mario is Missing. You can come back home using a device that seems like a huge mecha of Mario’s hand, but despite what you are thinking it doesn't do anything else interesting. The DOS game does have multiple ending depending on how fast you complete your task and if you returned the items correctly. 'Paradise' is Bowser getting away. The next is where the player makes a mistake. The third is quite brutal as Bowser gets squashed  by a dinosaur Jurassic Park style. Ouch. The SNES version has less locations to worry about.</p>
	
	<img src="PaperImages/Timulator_in_MiM_SNES_opening.png" alt="SNES Timulator screenshot">
		<p style="text-align:center"><em>At least this time he's not auctioning this stuff on ebay..</em></p>
	
	<p><b>NES:</b> <a href="http://www.thegameisafootarcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Marios-Time-Machine-Game-Manual.pdf"> (Manual here)</a> The game is redesigned for the hardware. Mario and Yoshi stumble upon the Bowser Museum this time. Yoshi decides to waltz inside and gets kidnapped, a plot point nonexistent in the other versions. A couple of  things are simplified. To time travel you play a brief Mario Bros inspired game to get an item then jump into a pipe. Certainly feels a bit more like ‘Mario’ doesn’t it? The time peroids are already predetermined so you don't enter them manualy. You don’t have to do the npc detective work either to return stuff, rather read message blocks that describe the location. You will of course have to guess correctly where you are stilll. I actually like this a bit better. The visuals are alright for the system it’s on it's just too bad it’s a snore fest because the enemies can’t hurt you. </p>

	<p>Overall these games make the cardinal mistake of taking the Mario out of Mario. With Mario in these real life locations it’s just not that interesting and interrogating NPCs is not a mechanical that remains fresh enough to base a game around. I will say that the score system does something this time and is in fact tied to the ending you get. The password system also returns so you can jump around if you wish.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>These games take place in 1993! 
		<li>DK Junior makes a cameo in the NES version
	</ul>

<h2>Mario's Early Years! Fun with Letters (1993)</h2>
	<img src="https://www.mariowiki.com/images/1/15/PC_Box_-_Mario%27s_Early_Years%21_Fun_with_Letters.jpg" alt="pc box">
	<p>Now the other two games were trying to be games. Mario's Early Years! Fun with Letters is purely for very small kids as indicated in the title. There is a PC and SNES version with some slight changes. Both teach basic English and are controlled by clicking around a cursor. Mario and Peach and Yoshi are playable characters but you don’t really ‘play them’ because again you’re mostly clicking around to pick the right answers. The graphics are way off in both versions. There is some voice acting so imagine the fun there. There is actually quite of lot of lines in this game. It’s worth a Youtube watch and that’s it.</p>
	
		<img src="https://www.mariowiki.com/images/a/a2/Sentence_World.png" alt="screenshot">
		<p style="text-align:center"><em>Above: Be careful how you answer that one! Also, Luigi is using Super Mario 64 moves three years early!</em></p>
		
	<ul>
		<li>Koopalings make an off-model cameo here and there.
		<li>Uses SNES Mouse for that real point and click action!!!
	</ul>

<h2>Mario's Early years! Fun with Numbers (1994)</h2>
	<img src="https://www.mariowiki.com/images/c/c1/Mario_Numbers.jpg" alt="pc box">
	<p>For PC and SNES this game focuses on numbers but also comparisons and geometry. Again we have the same type of voice acting and point and click gameplay. The locations feel a little more Mario with some Super Mario World backdrops depending on minigame but overall are similar to the above. The SNES version lacks the Sing Song World but this is a favor trust me! Again, check it out on Youtube and that’s it.</p>
	
	
		<img src="https://www.mariowiki.com/images/a/ad/Counting_World.png" alt="island">
		<p style="text-align:center"><em>That part of Isle Delfino no one talks about</em></p>
	<ul>
		<li>More SNES Mouse action, yeah!!
	</ul>

<h2>Mario's Early Years! Preschool Fun (1994)</h2>
		<img src="https://www.mariowiki.com/images/4/49/DOSMarioPreschoolFun-1-200.jpg" alt="pc">
		<p style="text-align:center"><em>We zoomed way out because.. actually this small image is all I could find..</em></p>

		
	<p>The series ended with a whisper rather than a bang. This is a sort of free for all game for small kids. You count objects, identify body parts (yes), find opposites, match sounds to animals, match whatever to whatever. You get it. Last is the Sing Song World again left out of the SNES version. Aesthetics are entirely the same deal. In Counting World Peach teaches a class room apparently.</p>

<h3>Series overview: While unremarkable games as far as the 'game' part goes, I must applaud the earlier titles for doing something different with Mario with an educational spin underneath. It’s too bad the later ones delved completely into the educational genre without any attempt to pretend to be a normal game. I sometimes wonder what they would have came up with in the style of the first two games. They are well known for not being great but at least they are known somewhat, unlike the forgettable Mario Early Years titles.</h3>
