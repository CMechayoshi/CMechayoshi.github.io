	<em>(Originally featured on my<a href=”https://boomaster-amia.tumblr.com/> “boomaster-amia tumblr page on 12/25/14</a>, now rewritten and revised)</em>

	<p>This article will focus on one of the few Mario games available multiple consoles because I find the occurrence uncommon yet interesting. This will not count re-releases (such as Mario Kart 8 vs Deluxe) and of course not Virtual Console (or emulation, ha!). </p>

	<p>Mario's Missing: The infamous early game where Luigi takes center stage. This game from 1993 was on the NES, SNES, PC, and later Mac. Nintendo of course on licenced the characters so you know this will be a fun one..<sub>Not really</sub> The plot involves Bowser trying to flood the EARTH. (Yes. The real world.) However to do so, he needs a multitude of hairdryers and to buy that, he has his minions travel all over the world to steal landmarks to sell.</p>

	<p>Mario and co follow Bowser to stop him and while details vary between versions, the end result will be Mario getting captured so that Luigi must save the day. Interesting notes is that Brooklyn is mentioned in <a href="https://themushroomkingdom.net/manuals/mim-snes.txt"> manual </a> so the game makers were more influenced by the cartoons than the games!</p>

	<p>Above: The map you guide Yoshi around.</p>

	<p>This is a ‘side-walk-scroller’, get it? You traverse the streets and look both ways before crossing, all in the hunt for clues then Koopa Troopas with artifacts. It's "educational" in the sense that you must put artifacts were they belong based off of their real world location. That is why the ‘curators’ are there to quiz
	and accept the items. Luigi has to call Yoshi once he knows where he is and to get out of the level or the exit will be blocked. No, it’s not as easy as simply looking to know where you are and you can't just ask a local point blank. (The game would end in five seconds.) 
	Secure the cities and move on through Bowser's castle and occationally fight Koopalings that may or may not have voice actors depending on version. There is a password system to save some progress.</p>

	<p>In short, it’s a fascinating game to me in ways but over all my least favorite of the non-Nintendo published games. It's just not a good in gameplay or 
	education considering it’s known errors and repetitive nature. </p>

	<ul>
		<li>Bowser's Koopas have somehow stolen items that are ridiculous even by Mario standards like entire buildings. A simple change could have made
		this less silly. What if they were only threatening to destroy locations or where holding them hostage? The manual linked above mentions them "trashing"
		locations not sticking them in their pockets so obviously a memo got missed between the story and game department.
		<li>Boss fights are in name only. Bosses don't HURT YOU!
		<li>Art style is all over the place even in the console versions. I understand that the DOS or computer variants draw their own uncanny looking sprites
		but the SNES for example mixes Super Mario World with ugly off model specimens.
		<li>A lot of cities look the same. The computer versions offer real images which is nice however. Also, some effort is put into makeing music vary slightly by location.
		<li>Minor, but the point system doesn't do anything.
		<li>The way the Super Mario World real world map looks is actually pretty cool.
		<li>A CD deluxe version adds more voice acting and also realistic photos and video clips.
