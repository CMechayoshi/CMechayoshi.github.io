<b>Nintendo Adventure Book </b><font color="#000000"><b># 8</b></font><b>:
Flown the Koopa</b></p>
<p><b>Intro: </b>In this book by Matt Wayne, Mario and the crew visit
Dinosaur Land for the Dino-Flying Derby. Soon however something is
amiss, a magikoopa is turning dinosaurs into stone for his own
amusement. Use the puzzles to stop this crafty koopa menace! This is
adapted from a handwritten draft from 10/7/19. I don&rsquo;t
physically own this book at the moment, I used a pdf to create this
guide. As usual, look on the Nintendo Adventure Books Key to
understand how to use this <font color="#000000">page</font>.</p>

<p><b>Summary and concluding thoughts:</b> As this was yet another in
the series I never got to grow up with as a kid, my feelings could
have went either way. Thankfully it&rsquo;s a good book overall. 
</p>
<p>The premise and bad guy, a random magikoopa cousin of Bowser, is
quirky, also shallow but that&rsquo;s expected. It&rsquo;s nice to
see OCs in these books. The Dinosaur Land settings are used well with
more than generic areas from the game. There&rsquo;s only a few major
locations here, but they work and there&rsquo;s no aimlessness.
Writing quality and character interactions were some of the best in
the series with lots of funny moments and banter, even some very
amusing game over scenarios. Structure wise while it gets linear in
the very end like most of these books do, I like the many paths you
can take to get there. There&rsquo;s several events you can
completely miss on <font color="#000000">a</font> read-through, but
as long as you obtain the correct items you&rsquo;d make it to the
end. They never explain who messed up the Dinosaur Derby however, I
mean it&rsquo;s implied to be Bowser or the magikoopa but there&rsquo;s
no real answer.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s touch on the items and puzzles. The early cookie bag
puzzle somewhat uniquely (but in a bad way) has a <font color="#000000">quirk</font>
where what you chose means you do NOT get that item. This book has an
&lsquo;item of doom&rsquo;, the flashlight which will <font color="#000000">screw</font>
you later in the book. Worse yet, the items you need that you do
obtain if you chose correctly isn&rsquo;t emphasized in the book so,
you can have what you need and yet misinterpret it. So the item
checks here are a little harsh, but not the worse offenders in the
family. While some puzzles are okay and well suited for the theme of
whatever is going on, <font color="#000000">others feel</font>
needlessly over complicated, tempting you to guess on choices. Points
wise, the coins are a little scarce in the book, which I prefer as it
makes mapping high score paths easier. There are several moments
where hazards can diminish coins, <font color="#000000">so be</font>
mindful. I also liked the detail of how you can buy the popcorn item
for some coins and make a later part easier or tough it out for the
higher score. The only other flaw I have to point out at the moment
is that I&rsquo;m not sure how to max out the score yet. See the
optimal path below. <span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><b>Overall
4/5. I really like it enough just for the writing to overlook the
puzzles.</b></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Optimal Path:</b></p>
<p><i>START: 1 (tickets, ten coins)- 93 (flower, feather)- 37- 46
(fifteen coins)- 113- 55- 118- 63- 51- 100 (ten coins, remote)- 22-
50- 115- 54- 80- 110- 90- 76- 31- 48 (ten coins)- 96- 85- 36- 77
(used flower)- 34- 58- 4 (use remote)- 61- 74 (three-hundred coins)
END</i></p>
<p>This gives you 3450 points, &ldquo;King of the Sewers&rdquo; and
the second highest. We skip the monty mole layer on that route
because it goes really out of the way however even with those points
you won&rsquo;t have the highest points. That means, you gotta loop
somehow and that&rsquo;s silly!</p>

<p><b>Puzzle </b><font color="#000000"><b>analysis</b></font>:
Seventeen puzzles, most of them &lsquo;logic&rsquo; type. There are
two &lsquo;mazes&rsquo;, three &lsquo;decipher&rsquo; puzzles, one
maze/other, one word search, one decipher/logic, and one
matching/logic. So logic wins? This isn&rsquo;t the easiest of the
books puzzle wise, but the difficultly is mostly having a lot of
<font color="#000000">busy-work</font> to do rather than needing to
think hard.</p>

get the remote. 
</p>
<p>Battle the thwomp: Is on the necessary path as well, so pointless
to mention besides reinforcing that you&rsquo;re on the right tract.</p>
<p>The Mega Mole layer: <font color="#000000">This</font> can be
easily skipped, <font color="#000000">but</font> in their defense it
does award some more coins. It just felt so out of the way my optimal
path skips it, but I totally understand the hint.</p>
<p>Three for three? So these hints are <font color="#000000">quite</font>
good overall.</p>
