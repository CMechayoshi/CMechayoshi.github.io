<h1>The Charvel Page (Under Construction)</h1>

<p>Charvel Guitars: As with the Jacksons this database will focus  on normal production guitars, but let’s get into some brief history. Wayne Charvel started “Charvel’s Guitar Repair” in 1974, doing repairs and refinishes on out-of-warranty Fenders. Later Charvel began to build guitars out of parts. Charvel was sold to Grover Jackson in 1978, yes before the 80s even started. Here is where the custom revamps of the Stratocasters come from, the ‘superstrats’ with humbuckers, wild graphics, and other fun stuff that made Charvel a top choice for rock and metal artists. As on the Jackson main page linked <a href="CharvelJackson.html">HERE</a>, and asterisk means more information is needed.</p>

<h3>Charvel Model Series: These were built by the Japanese Chushin Gakki factory from 1986-88 (mostly. There’s some 1989s we’ll cover too). While highly revered now, the idea of Charvel making imports was divisive among fans. Now however most can agree they’re solid classic axes. There is a Model 1 through 8 guitars with and a Model 1 through 4 bass. See the personal collection Google Drive link for some Charvel basses I’ve personally owned.</h3>

<h3>Dating: You can determine year on a bolt-on by the neckplate and headstock logo. 1986 will lack a neckplate gasket and have ‘TM’ on the neckplate and ‘TM’ after headstock symbol. 1987 has the gasket, ‘TM’ on neckplate, and ‘R’ after headstock logo. 1988 has the gasket and ‘R’ on the neckplate and after headstock logo. If neck-thru the serial syntax is CXXXXXX. The X after the C reveals date. IE. C606073 is a 1986. </h3>
