	<h2>-Common myths-</h2>

		<p><b>-Is it (presumably a Dinky) 7/8 size of a Stratocaster?:</b> Soloists and Dinky’s have a smaller body (thinner waist, more horn cutaway) than a typical Fender Stratocaster is all you really need to know. The confusion comes from several places. Remember that game where a chain of people whisper some fact in each other's ears and by the time its over it's changed into a completely different statement? Some think a Dinky is smaller than a Soloist because if it's in the model name it must be true? No, they are the same. The Soloist had the smaller shape first actually. Be aware Jackson had 'strat or vintage style' guitars in the 80s with a larger strat body. Check the 1988 Catalog for example. Guitars with 22 frets as opposed to the typical 24 frets will have an altered body shape. In short, there isn't a single body size for all Soloists and Dinkies.</p>


		<p><b>-(Concerning older 90s era Jacksons) Does the right lower horn cutout mean it’s a short scale Fusion?:</b> Good catch, but no. A lot of Charvel and Jackson Fusions do have that feature, but it's not exclusive to those guitars.</p>

		<p><b>-Are all of the Profession line guitars the prized USA killers?:</b> Online and local sellers will use this as a selling point so it is important to know the difference. The 'Pro' Jacksons Professionals were the top of the line and only made for a shorter time. They may have a 'Pro' or blank truss rod cover. That can be changed or altered so its important to be more familiar with the specifications of the guitar to know what you are getting. (Such as using this database). For example a Rhoads may be a Pro or a STD or an EX. Later Professionals are still from the same factory but intentionally made with less premium parts. They are still amazing, enough to be fizzled out eventually anyway, but don't let sellers apply the legendary status to them unfairly.</p>

	<h2>-Jackson categories-</h2>
	
	<p>How to wrap your head about the naming schemes used over the years:</p>
	
	<p>Jacksons for the USA market at least work on a name+suffix system. Eample: A Jackson Dinky DK1 means 'Jackson' 'Dinky=DK' '1=USA highest model'. The numbers usually assend to represent a lower model. so DK2 is the lower import. Right away you will find trouble as you realize that the naming scheme can change, secondly you will find that there are tons of not so obvious suffixes attached to a lot of the more modern Jacksons. Let's break it down:</p>
	
	<table>
	<tr>
		<th>1</th>
		<th>USA made almost always. This came around about 1996 to replace what were until then called the Soloist/Dinky/Rhoads/etc Custom, the top USA but not Custom shop guitar. In modern times, these are Custom Select, a where you can customize some aspects without it being a full custom model. But wait, there's more twists. For the King V and Kelly, this is also a signature model, so that their modern equivalents actually use the '2'. See below. Anti-examples: The Professional DX1. Kelly Bass KB1, a few others</th>
	<tr>
		<th>2</th>
		<th>Either USA or higher end import. In the late 90s, this could a more budget USA made Jackson with some lesser hardware like a licensed Floyd. Later this more often became the higher end import, such as the earlier DK2 MIJ or later DK2 made in Mexico. For the Kelly and King V, the KV2 and KE2 are actually in the place of the 1 series, they just don't call it that because the KV1 and KE1 are old signature models. There is however a MIJ Professional KV2. (tricky tricky!) Lastly, this can indicate pickups. The modern DK2 and DK3 are contemporaries, just indicating two humbuckers or two singles and  a single hum.</th>
	<tr>
		<th>3</th>
		<th>Usually it means a mid ranged import, either MIJ or elsewhere. For DK3 (modern) this means three pickups.</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>4</th>
		<th>Usually a mid to lower or just simply plainer looking import early on. Early on MIJ but no newer examples will be. Can also be a different that usual aesthetic. Ex. Soloist SLX4</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>5</th>
		<th>Midrange import. Rarely used in 90s to be the plainer option. Later to now it means either a different aesthetic or neck-through.</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>6</th>
		<th>Means six strings. Used as early as the early 00s Dinky DR6</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>7</th>
		<th>Means seven strings! Used as early as the early 00s DR7, RR7, etc</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>24</th>
		<th>Means twenty-four frets. A Rhoads variant. Note that other Jackson models can vary with number of frets but it's never reflected in the name.</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>S</th>
		<th>Comes with Sustainiac Ex. DK2S. </th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>L or LH</th>

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>M</th>
		<th>Maple fretboard</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>FF</th>
		<th>Indicates the rather limited Fire inlays. You can see it on a few Dinky models, though Jackson Stars offered it much more liberally.</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>R</th>
		<th><strike>Rarely used,</strike> meaning reverse headstock. Some new 2021 MIJ models use this again</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>AT or A</th>
		<th>Arched top body. Later you'll see the later added to the end of the model name. Example: DKA In some 2021 models this means Ash top</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>MG</th>
		<th>MG series from 00s onward. Early MIJ, with EMGs that were passive (early) or active later. This was above X Series and the same as Pro Series. Later however these are Indonesian imports with active EMGS. They are also now categorized under X or Pro Series instead of it's own category though the acronym of course remained.</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>MAH</th>
		<th>Mahogany body.</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>T</th>
		<th>TOM bridge option, but on rare occasion tremolo. Confusing I know.</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>X</th>
		<th>X series, more budget to mid range imports. These can be made in India or Japan early only, depending on guitar, and later Indonesia and China. If the 'X' is a suffix however it may just mean a different aesthetic. </th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>DX</th>
		<th>Not used a lot. Means a different aesthetic. </th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Q or QH</th>
		<th>Quilt maple top</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>F or FR</th>
		<th>Floyd Rose in newer guitars. Rarely may mean flame top.</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>NT</th>
		<th>Neck-through. Used for new Concert Basses</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>FS</th>
		<th>Seymour Duncan or Duncan Design Firestorm control, that third knob. 00s only on a few guitars</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>HT or H</th>
		<th>Hardtail bridge. Rarely just a 'H'</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>10 10D</th>
		<th>A lower to mid import on just a few early X Series guitars.</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>JS #</th>
		<th>This is the budget line, at the outset sparse and plain models but now offering plenty of options in all the major Jackson body shapes. Country of origin vary between India, Indonesia, and China and rarely Japan. The numbers go up to increase in 'features'. Number scheme varies between 1, 11, 12, 20, 22, 30, 32, 30, and 45. What this means depends on the guitar.</th>

	</tr>
		<tr>
		<th>MS</th>
		<th>Multi-scale </th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>EX</th>
		<th>Not the Professional EX (see below), rather means 'extreme' in newer guitars. Often features active pickups (but not EMG like MG Series) or may mean something else (SL27 EX Wildcard)</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>SD</th>
		<th>Rarely means Seymour Duncan.
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>FSR</th>
		<th>Fender Special Run. Used on JS32 Rhoads FSR. Seems to have different aesthetic.
	</tr>
		<tr>
		<th>JX</th>
		<th>Rarely in early 00s were in between JS and X Series. Ex: JX10, JX40, JX45. Later assuming the model was still made, Jackson would  reassign it as plain JS Series. Ex again: JX10

    <p>Notable outliers</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Acronyms exclusive to signature models: Scott Ian's Soloists have their own scheme plus others
			<li>PS 1-7: Performer, the budget but not lowest end models from mid to late 90s. Made in Japan or Korea with the numbers mostly indicating the variant and lesser any sort of ranking.
			<li>Late 90s to early 00s Concert Bass: Use a system of C4 or 5 or 20 etc to indicate model.
			<li>Jackson will reuse a name for multiple guitars. Just in general, know that there may always be an exception for this stuff.

	<table>
		
		<tr>
			<th>Pro</th>
			<th>The initial line of Professional guitars created of highest quality. Featuring MOP inlays and logos, ebony fretboards and high end electronics. Other specs vary. There was Soloist (reg and archtop plus special 91), Fusion, Kip Winger, Phil Collen, Warrior and Rhoads. Later Stealth, Ininity (has rosewood), Futura, Kelly and King V (Mustaine sig). There was never a Dinky or Concert Bass Pro oddly. </th>

			<th>Usually the next step down but still with with aestetics like sharkfin inlays, binding, higher end electronics, and metallic finishes.</th>
		</tr>

		</tr>
		
			<tr>
