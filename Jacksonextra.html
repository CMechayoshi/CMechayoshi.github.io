	<h2>-Misc facts; Common myths-</h2>

		<p><b>-Is it (presumably a Dinky) 7/8 size of a Stratocaster?:</b> Soloists and Dinky’s have a smaller body (thinner waist, more horn cutaway) than a typical Fender Stratocaster is all you really need to know. The confusion comes from several places. Remember that game where a chain of people whisper some fact in each other's ears and by the time its over it's changed into a completely different statement? Some think a Dinky is smaller than a Soloist because if it's in the model name it must be true? No, they have the same shape. The Soloist had the smaller shape first actually. Be aware Jackson had 'strat or vintage style' guitars in the 80s with a larger strat body. Check the 1988 Catalog for example. Guitars with 22 frets as opposed to the typical 24 frets will have an altered body shape and while that's not exactly the question being asked, that's one reason why the shape might differ. Observe this in any 22 fret Custom shop guitars or the rare production model like the 90s DK1 or the 00s SL4 (MIJ).</p>


		<p><b>-(Concerning older 90s era Jacksons) Does the right lower horn cutout mean it’s a short scale Fusion?:</b> Good catch, but no. A lot of Charvel and Jackson Fusions do have that feature, but it's not exclusive to those guitars.</p>

		<p><b>-Are all of the Professional line guitars the prized USA killers?:</b> Online and local sellers will use this as a selling point so it is important to know the difference. The 'Pro' Jacksons Professionals were the top of the line imports and eventually discontinued. If a particular example is unmolested, it can be identified by a 'Pro' (later) or blank (originally) truss rod cover. I know, yeah right, so it's important to be more familiar with the specifications of the guitar to know what you are getting. (Such as using this database). Keep in mind later Professionals are still from the same factory but less premium. For example a Rhoads may be a Pro or a STD or an EX and all have different specs. They are all still great playing and age very well so go grab one. Just know what you have and don't get taken advantage of.</p>
		
		<p><b>-What is the country of origin for this Jackson/ Charvel??</b> Sit down, this will be a read. It used to be pretty easy. Jacksons were all USA until '89 whereas Charvel started the MIJ Chusin Gakki 'Model Series' in 1986. In late '89 Jackson created the Professional Series imports which was one line initially then around 92' (note to self: check) the Professional line was split into the various categories (See: Professional Categories below) depending on specification. The Charvette Charvels came also around '89-91 and some are Japanese or Korean. Charvel evolved the Model series line up with new models (Standard, Contemporary, Fusion, Classic, etc) but these remain MIJ for that period.</p>
			
		<p>In the nineties most of the Jackson imports remain MIJ even if the Professional line is gradually dropped after 1996. Charvels however can be Korean or very rarely Chinese made from this period, mostly  the cheaper models. You'll know when you see it. The same applies for the uncommonly seen Jackson and Charvel electronics. The Charvel practice amps are Korean. The Jackson JG tube amps are UK made. Jackson has a Korean Preamp. Not sure about the Reference Series amps and/or the cabinets. Late 90s Jackson creates the JS Series made in India. At the 2000s the main Jackson imports are either Pro, X, or MG series. Pro and MG series were always MIJ as usual. The X Series could very early on be Indian but switched to MIJ later. Charvel had MIJ San Dimas and Chinese Desolation Series stuff around this time. Also of course the USA stuff. Yes the Fender buyout happens early 00s here but not much really changes, at least not yet.</p>
		
		<p>Now post 2011, things switch up again. Jackson decided that their legacy wasn't tied to the country of their imports so it wasn't important that it's MIJ. (Look it up) Pro Series Jacksons are Indonesian often earlier but may also be Chinese depending on finish or neck construction. Understand that the country of origin isn't really tied to the quality level necessarily but other factors like the finish options. Some finishes like crackle are only on Chinese made Jacksons. They also are often neck-thru models like a Soloist. JS Series are usually Chinese. X Series are Indonesian or Chinese (?) Pro Series may be Indonesian, korean, chinese, or mexican (Usually bolt on Dinkies) The Charvels become Mexican later on which makes sense when they are usually bolt on. The USA Select remains of course. On the subject however, all USA Jackson stop being a normal production model, but instead of semi-custom deal. Most recently at the time of writing this, MIJ Jackson return via Fender's factory. These are labeled MJ Series and Jackson doesn't hesitate to nod to older players with that as a selling point. I'll remain neutral on that. Upper end stuff otherwise is Korean so look for that generally and you know it's supposed to be a better offering.</p>
		
		<p><b>-My Jackson is MIJ (and it's not a Professional) and it has 97xxxxx... so it's a 1997?</b> That's 99% incorrect, specially when someone is saying it on the internet or trying to sell an old Jackson to you. There is however one way it might be right, but before I list that exception (there are so few I can indeed list them all out) let's look at how Jackson serial numbers were working then. First just read <a href="https://www.jcfonline.com/forum/equipment/import-jackson-guitars/103845-import-serial-number-country-of-origin-faq">this thread</a> as it will explain better than I could. Well, TL;DR? MIJ bolt on guitars with a seven digit serials are sequential starting from 9600000. To put it in perspective, they end for the Chushin guitars at 98-something. For these fortunately you can often find the actual date by taking the neck off. If its neck-through however, the first two digits are telling you the truth. Bolt-on models with no neckplate work similarly. Now.. for that special exception? The Concept Series from 1994 will have a serial telling you so plainly but a few Professional Series caught in this transitional period will have a 94-ect serial too. I personally had a Jackson Concert Bass Ex with a serial like that. The elusive Dinky HX purportedly has a serial that will reflect the date.</p>
		
		<p>Lastly to not stray off topic too much, normally for Professionals its a six digit and you just look at the first number. Also you can use this information to decipher the country of origin from a model that's made in two different countries, Korean vs Japan or Indian vs Japan. If you see the appropriate number scheme above you know it's a MIJ as the Indian ones often start a different way. Warning: 80s Charvel import serials might look like the Professional serials but don't read the same. Modern (aka not MIJ) Jackson JS, X and Pro Series guitars that were made from 2013 until present day feature a 10-digit alphanumeric serial number located on the back of the headstock or neckplate. The first two number digits in the serial number identify the year the guitar was created. </p>
		
		<p><b>-Other misc facts I need to verify:</b>J Serials on USA is full custom. U serials on USA are production models. Paul Gagon designed the Jackson pickups and electronics until 1990. Dan Lawrence did the old graphic finishes. USA factory locations: San Dimas '82-86. Ontario '87-01. Corona '02-</p>

	<h2>-Jackson categories-</h2>
	
	<p>How to wrap your head about the naming schemes used over the years:</p>
	
	<p>Jacksons for the USA market at least work on a name+suffix system. Eample: A Jackson Dinky DK1 means 'Jackson' 'Dinky=DK' '1=USA highest model'. The numbers usually ascend to represent a lower model. so DK2 is the lower import. Right away you will find trouble as you realize that the naming scheme can change, secondly you will find that there are tons of not so obvious suffixes attached to a lot of the more modern Jacksons. Let's break it down:</p>
<div style="background-color:#1754a3">
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>1</th>
		<td>USA made almost always. This came around about 1996 to replace what were until then called the Soloist/Dinky/Rhoads/etc Custom, the top USA but not Custom shop guitar. In modern times, these are Custom Select, a where you can customize some aspects without it being a full custom model. But wait, there's more twists. For the King V and Kelly, this is also a signature model, so that their modern equivalents actually use the '2'. See below.<br> <em>Anti-examples: The Professional DX1. Kelly Bass KB1, a few others</em></td>
	<tr>
		<th>2</th>
		<td>Either USA or higher end import. In the late 90s, this could a more budget USA made Jackson with some lesser hardware like a licensed Floyd. Later this more often became the higher end import, such as the earlier DK2 MIJ or later DK2 made in Mexico. For the Kelly and King V, the KV2 and KE2 are actually in the place of the 1 series, they just don't call it that because the KV1 and KE1 are old signature models. There is however a MIJ Professional KV2. (tricky tricky!) Lastly, this can indicate pickups. The modern DK2 and DK3 are contemporaries, just indicating two humbuckers or two singles and  a single hum.</td>
	<tr>
		<th>3</th>
		<td>Usually it means a mid ranged import, either MIJ or elsewhere. For DK3 (modern) this means three pickups.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>4</th>
		<td>Usually a mid to lower or just simply plainer looking import early on. Early on MIJ but no newer examples will be. Can also be a different that usual aesthetic. Ex. Soloist SLX4</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>5</th>
		<td>Midrange import. Rarely used in 90s to be the plainer option. Later to now it means either a different aesthetic or neck-through.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>6</th>
		<td>Means six strings. Used as early as the early 00s Dinky DR6</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>7</th>
		<td>Means seven strings! Used as early as the early 00s DR7, RR7, etc</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>22, 24</th>
		<td>Means twenty-four frets. A Rhoads variant. Note that other Jackson models can vary with number of frets but it's never reflected in the name. For (newer) Charvels, this may also indicate 22 or 24 frets.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>S</th>
		<td>Comes with Sustainiac Ex. DK2S. Later means shattered glass finish. Ex. KEXS</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>L or LH</th>
		<td>Indicates left handed model, often with less color options unfortunately for southpaws</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>M</th>
		<td>Maple fretboard</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>FF</th>
		<td>Indicates the rather limited Fire inlays. You can see it on a few Dinky models, though Jackson Stars offered it much more liberally.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>R</th>
		<td><strike>Rarely used,</strike> meaning reverse headstock. Some new 2021 MIJ models use this again</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>AT or A</th>
		<td>Arched top body. Later you'll see the later added to the end of the model name. Example: DKA In some 2021 models this means Ash top</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>MG</th>
		<td>MG series from 00s onward. Early MIJ, with EMGs that were passive (early) or active later. This was above X Series and the same as Pro Series. Later however these are Indonesian imports with active EMGS. They are also now categorized under X or Pro Series instead of it's own series though the MG will remain in the model number as an indicator of EMGs.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>MAH</th>
		<td>Mahogany body as an option. For some guitars the mahogany body becomes standard spec, making redundancies. (See for example: Pro Series SL2)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>T</th>
		<td>TOM bridge option, but on rare occasion (usually older guitars) tremolo option. Confusing I know.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>X</th>
		<td>X series, more budget to mid range imports. These can be made in India or Japan early only, depending on guitar, and later Indonesia and China. If the 'X' is a suffix however it may just mean a different aesthetic. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>DX</th>
		<td><s>Not used a lot.</s> Quite often means a different aesthetic. Can be synonymous with 'EX' (see entry)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Q or QH</th>
		<td>Quilt maple top</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>F or FR</th>
		<td>Floyd Rose in newer guitars. Rarely may mean flame top.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>NT</th>
		<td>Neck-through. Used for new Concert Basses</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>FS</th>
		<td>Seymour Duncan or Duncan Design Firestorm control, that third knob. 00s only on a few guitars</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>HT or H</th>
		<td>Hardtail bridge. Rarely just a 'H'</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>10 10D</th>
		<td>A lower to mid import on just a few early X Series guitars.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>JS #</th>
		<td>This is the budget line, at the outset sparse and plain models but now offering plenty of options in all the major Jackson body shapes. Country of origin vary between India, Indonesia, and China and rarely Japan. The numbers go up to increase in 'features'. Number scheme varies between 1, 11, 12, 20, 22, 30, 32, 30, 45 and more. What this means depends on the guitar.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>IV</th>
		<td>Four string bass</td>
	</tr>
		<tr>
		<th>V</th>
		<td>Five string bass</td>
	</tr>
		<tr>
		<th>MS</th>
		<td>Multi-scale </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>EX</th>
		<td>Not the Professional EX (see below), rather means 'extreme' in newer guitars. Often features active pickups (but not EMG like MG Series) or may mean something else (SL27 EX Wildcard)</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>SD</th>
		<td>Rarely means Seymour Duncan.
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>FSR</th>
		<td>Fender Special Run. Used on JS32 Rhoads FSR. Seems to have different aesthetic.
	</tr>
		<tr>
		<th>JX</th>
		<td>Rarely in early 00s were in between JS and X Series. Ex: JX10, JX40, JX45. Later assuming the model was still made, Jackson would  reassign it as plain JS Series. Ex again: JX10
	</tr>

		<td>New for 2021, Made in Japan models
	</tr>
	<tr>

		<td>Ebony fretboard option on some modern Charvels
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>H, HH, or HSH, 2PT</th>
		<td>Indicates pickup configuration on modern Charvels and Jacksons (aka 2H= two hum). A later format for Charvels specifically is the 2PT etc, again indicating number of pickups
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>AX/S or Axis </th>
		<td>Or whatever its called. Possibly 1999? Two Dinkys, Kellys, and Rhoads, models that would become X Series models in 2000.

		<p>1994-95 MIJ budget models that became Performers later. This is also an early instance of Jackson using 'X' in a model name to represent alternate or unusual specs.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>JRR: A Rhoads with TOM string-thru body. Later became Performer PS3T (ie Jackson Randy Rhoads)
			<li>JDR: A Dinky Reverse HSH. Later became Performer PS4 (ie Jackson Dinky Reverse)
			<li>JSX: A Stealth. Didn't directly become anything as the Stealth TH1 and TH2 succeeding it are different. (ie Jackson Stealth X)
			<li>JDX: A HSS Dinky with a telecaster style fixed bridge. Unique model. (ie Jackson Dinky X)
		</ul>

	<h2>-Grover Jackson and Jackson Stars-</h2>
	
		<p>They have their own schemes it seems. Here's what I have so far: (Model).(Series)-(RRP)</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Various numbers: List price, a commonly Japanese way to categorize.
			<li>HH: Two humbuckers
			<li>SSH: two single coils, one hum
			<li>U.S.: US custom shop
			<li>L: Left handed
			<li>SL: Soloist
			<li>RR: Rhoads

			<li>BB: Black Blood
			<li>STL: Stealth
			<li>WR: Warrior
			<li>S: Supreme. Jackson USA built
			<li>I, J1, TN01: Impression. Highest end import.
			<li>D, J2, TN02: Delight. Step below but still higher end. 
			<li>D/E: Delight EMG
			<li>P: Progress: Mid level import

			<li>J.S.B: Japan Spirit Bridge. Using TOM
			<li>SB: Super Bolt-on neck with full heel cut
			<li>M.F.T: Maximum Fun through neck.
		</ul>

			
    <h3>Notable outliers</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Acronyms exclusive to signature models: Scott Ian's Soloists have their own scheme plus others
			<li>PS 1-7: Performer, the budget but not lowest end models from mid to late 90s. Made in Japan or Korea with the numbers mostly indicating the variant and lesser any sort of ranking.
			<li>Late 90s to early 00s Concert Bass: Use a system of C4 or 5 or 20 etc to indicate model.
			<li>Jackson will reuse a name for multiple guitars. Just in general, know that there may always be an exception for this stuff.
			<li>As of 2021 sometimes there's no explanation or they bend their own rules a little more. For example there exists both a Pro Series and X Series 'DK2'. This is because the 2 really only indicates the pickups. Okay easy to get, but there is an X Series SL1 preexisting with the  USA SL1. No that Soloist isn't a single pickup config, so what does the '1' mean????
			
		</ul>
		
		
<h3>Other cues...</h3>
	
	
	<p><b>Pickups:</b> Sometimes the pickups give clues as the the tier of the guitar. For instance J-92C, J-90C, etc etc along with active electronics were in both the USA stuff and higher level MIJ imports of old. Other Jackson pickups, typically the ones you probably never hear about, would be in the cheaper guitars (some still good sounding though). In 1996 the USA stuff got Seymour Duncan and the higher imports Duncan Designs. A few models still had Jackson pickups however. There were also be some Kent Armstrong in some models (more research needed).</p>
		
		<p>In 2000 the MG series received EMG HZ with the afterburner boost. In 2006 the higher end imports received 'real' Seymour Duncans and the MG models active EMGs with no boost. Throughout this time the JS series stuff will always have cheaper Jackson pickups (CVR, later Belcat). Later, post-Chushin Gakki most of the Pro Series models still have Seymour Duncans and X series Duncan Designs. Later X series will get Jackson branded however. The MG is dissolved in a way into X series but keep what is usually 'real' active EMGS. Some Jackson in the late 10s got Seymour Duncan Blackouts as an alternative. JS have Jackson pickups as usual from Belcat. </p>
		
		<p>Even more later, into the 20s, there are on X series a new kind of active Jackson pickup. Jackson eventually offers models with Fishmans, sometimes still Blackouts and etc on upper end guitars but overall the typical upper end Jackson pickup remains Duncans, just like what they adopted in the mid 90s. 
		
		<p><b>Woods</b>: Less conclusive, but worth looking at. To summarize a lot, alder was used on early Jacksons 80s, then poplar a lot in 90s, with basswood often for the Dinkies. Import wise, the Cushin Gakki used a lot of basswood, but other woods for upper end models, polar, ash, etc. Ebony has typically been the typical default wood for upper end guitars, seen on USA and Japanese ones. When the later Indonesian Pro Jacksons came along however, they had ebony boards too. Now it's mixed. Expect a rosewood equivalent, laruel or whatever on the mid to lower stuff. Maple, or roasted CAN appear on more budget instruments, so it's not automatically an premium feature. <p>
		
		<p><b>Other materials:</b> Mother of Pearl is often on USA instruments, but occasionally abalone or something else. Upper end Professional Jacksons got this as well, and sometimes, oddly the EXes. After about 1996ish, pearloid was often used on imports, which can easily be determined by appearance, found on Pro series, MG, series, JS, X, etc. Rarely an aluminoid is used, a silverish look for inlays. Finish wise, USA have a catalog of finishes depending on year. Upper end MIJ imports received trans finish options, often with tops, and metallics, lower end the regular colors. In modern times however, the more budget JS or X series will have whatever finish, sometimes even graphic, so this is not a reliable way. Refer instead to it's model name according to chart.</p>

	<h3>Bridges and related:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>JT-6: Licensed Floyd Rose on Models 2-6 and more, sometimes Charvettes
			<li>JT-280: A single locking trem found on some Charvel CX series
			<li>JT-590: Schaller licensed Floyd made in Germany. May be stamped Jackson, Charvel, or Schaller. Black or Chrome. Found on USA and higher end MIJ guitars of the time. Phase out mid nineties. 
			<li>JT-570: Schaller single locking trem on some Charvels.
			<li>JT-580: Takeuchi licensed Floyd. Black or silver.
			<li>JT-580LP: The much more common later low profile version used in many models. Black, chrome, or satin chrome.
			<li>JT-500: Bridge found in lower end imports. Performers also X Series and maybe some JS series. Has same footprint as Schaller but says 'Jackson' or maybe is blank but will lack a 'Made in Germany' stamp.
			<li>JT-490 w/roller nut: High mass fulcrum tremolo with lock down saddles.
			<li>JT-390 w/tailpiece: TOM with Charvel floating tailpiece
			<li>J-370: Twelve string bridge with adjustable saddles
			<li>JT-380: Die cast fulcrum tremolo
			<li>JT-480: Vintage style synchronized tremolo
			<li>JT-470: two point vintage  style tremolo
			<li>JB-340: Standard bass bridge
			<li>JB-440: High mass bass bridge, track mounted saddles. Stamped Jackson. 
			<li>JB-540: TOM style bass bridge. OR a five string bass bridge. (Will research)
			<li>Kahler 2440 and Kahler 2450: Hardtail bass bridges with adjustable string spacing. USA.
			<li>Schaller FLC-202: On Japanese domestic Charvels.
			<li>‘Tunamatic’: TOM bridge from Japanese domestic models.
			<li>Jackson CBT-02: High mass bridge on Japanese domestic basses. Like the JB-440. 
			<li>Jackson HT: later hardtail bridge
			<li>Jackson double locking tremolo: On JS series
			<li>JT-585: The mounting studs for presumably JT-580
			<li>JT-480 (later): Seems to be an even cheaper JT-500 variant, often stamped blank instead of 'Jackson'. The AX/S Series came with them, also some lowest end imports and music store exclusive models.
