	<h2>-Common myths-</h2>

		<p><b>-Is it (persumably a Dinky) 7/8 size of a Stratocaster?:</b> Soloists and Dinky’s have a smaller body (thinner waist, more horn cutaway) than a typical Fender Stratocaster is all you really need to know. The confusion comes from several places. Remember that game where a chain of people whisper some fact in each other's ears and by the time its over it's changed into a competely different statement? Some think a Dinky is smaller than a Soloist because if it's in the model name it must be true? No, they are the same. The Soloist had the smaller shape first actually. Be aware Jackson had 'strat or vintage style' guitars in the 80s with a larger strat body. Check the 1988 Catalog for example. Guitars with 22 frets as opposed to the typical 24 frets will have an altered body shape. In short, there isn't a single body size for all Soloists and Dinkies.</p>


		<p><b>-(Concerning older 90s era Jacksons) Does the right lower horn cutout mean it’s a short scale Fusion?:</b> Good catch, but no. A lot of Charvel and Jackson Fusions do have that feature, but it's not exclusive to those guitars.</p>

		<p><b>-Are all of the Profession line guitars the prized USA killers?:</b>Online and local sellers will use this as a selling point so it is important to know the difference. The 'Pro' Jacksons Professionals were the top of the line and only made for a shorter time. They may have a 'Pro' or blank truss rod cover. That can be changed or altered so its important to be more familiar with the specifications of the guitar to know what you are getting. (Such as using this database). For example a Rhoads may be a Pro or a STD or an EX. Later Professionals are still from the same factory but intentionally made with less premium parts. They are still amazing, enough to be fizzled out eventually anyway, but don't let sellers apply the legendary status to them unfairly.</p>

	<h2>-Jackson categories-</h2>
	
	<p>How to wrap your head about the naming schemes used over the years</p>
	
	
		<p><b>The normal stuff:</b>Jacksons for the USA market at least work on a name+suffix system. Eample: A Jackson Dinky DK1 means 'Jackson' 'Dinky=DK' '1=USA highest model'. The numbers usually assend to represent a lower model. so DK2 is the lower import. Right away you will find trouble as you realize that the naming scheme can change, secondly you will find that there are tons of not so obvious suffixes attached to a lot of the more modern Jacksons. Let's break it down:</p>
		
			<ul>
				<li>1: USA made almost always. This came around about 1996 to replace what were until then called the Soloist/Dinky/Rhoads/etc Custom, the top USA but not Custom shop guitar. In modern times, these are Custom Select, a where you can customize some aspects without it being a full custom model. But wait, there's one more twists. For the King V and Kelly, this is also a signature model, so that their modern equivalents actually use the '2'. See below. Anti-examples: The Professional DX1. Kelly Bass KB1, a few others
				<li>2: Either USA or higher end import. In the late 90s, this could a more budget USA made Jackson with some lesser hardware like a licensed Floyd. Later this more often became the higher end import, such as the earlier DK2 MIJ or later DK2 made in Mexico. For the Kelly and King V, the KV2 and KE2 are actually in the place of the 1 series, they just don't call it that because the KV1 and KE1 are old signature models. There is however a MIJ Professional KV2. (tricky tricky!) Lastly, this can indicate pickups. The modern DK2 and DK3 are contemporaries, just indicating two humbuckers or two singles and  a single hum. 
				<li>3:Usually it means a mid ranged import, either MIJ or elsewhere. For DK3 (modern) this means three pickups.
				<li>4:Usually a mid to lower or just simply plainer looking import. No, it does not mean four pickups though that would be cool! Early on MIJ but no new examples will be. 
				<li>5:Midrange import. Rarely used 90s only.
				<li>6:Means six strings for newer guitars. In 90s, a mid ranged import. Ex: Dinky DR6.
				<li>7:Means seven strings!
				<li>24:Means twenty-four frets. A Rhoads variant.
				<li>L or LH:Indicates left handed model, often with less color options unfortunately for southpaws
				<li>M:Maple fretboard
				<li>FF:Indicates the rather limited Fire inlays. You can see it on a few Dinky models, though Jackson Stars offered it much more liberally.
				<li>R:Rarely used, meaning reverse headstock
				<li>AT:Arched top body.
				<li>MG:MG series from 00s. Mid ranged imports, MIJ, with EMG that were passive or active. In modern times MG may indicate mahogany body.
				<li>T:TOM bridge option, but on rare occation tremolo. Confusing I know.
				<li>X:X series, more budget to mid range imports. These can be made in India or Japan early only, depending on guitar, and later Indonesia and more? 
				<li>DX:Sort of vague and not used a lot. Means a different aesthetic. 
				<li>Q or QH:Quilt maple top
				<li>F or FR:FLoyd Rose in newer guitars
				<li>NT:Neck-through. Used for new Concert Basses
				<li>FS:Seymour Duncan or Duncan Design Firestorm control, that third knob. 00s only on a few guitars
				<li>HT:Hardtail bridge
				<li>10 10D:A lower to mid import on just a few early X Series guitars.
				<li>JS #:This is the budget line, at the outset sparse and plain models but now offering plenty of options in all the major Jackson body shapes. Country of origin vary between India, Indonesia, and China. The numbers go up to increase in 'quality'. Number scheme varies between 1, 11, 12, 20, 22, 30, 32, 30, and 45. What this means depends on the guitar.
				<li>IV:Four string bass
				<li>V:Five string bass
			</ul>
			
    <p>Notable outliers</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Acronyms exclusive to signature models: Scott Ian's Soloists have their own scheme. 
			<li>PS 1-7: Performer, the budget but not lowest end models from mid to late 90s. Made in Japan or Korea with the numbers mostly indicating the variant and lesser any sort of ranking.
			<li>Late 90s to early 00s Concert Bass: Use a system of C4 or 5 or 20 etc to indicate model.
		</ul>
	
	<h2>-Professional subcategories-</h2> 
	
		<p>Meant to be affordable for any professional guitarist!</p>
			
		<ul>
			<li>Pro: The inital line of Professional guitars created. Featured MOP inlays and logos, also ebony fretboards. Other specs vary. There was Soloist (reg and archtop), Fusion, Kip Winger, Phil Collen, Warrior and Rhoads. Later Stealth, Ininity (has rosewood), Futura, Kelly and King V (Mustaine sig). There was never a Dinky or Concert Bass Pro oddly. 
			<li>XL: Usually the next step with aestetics like sharkfin inlays, binding, higher end electronics.
			<li>STD or Standard: A plainer version of the XL with dots inlays and no binding. The actual features like neck construction, bridge, and pickups would normally be the same as the XL. Also sometimes had finish matching headstocks.
			<li>EX: The cheaper model with basic features and looks. In the case of the Concert Bass XL and EX the only difference is just the fretboard inlays in the Futura the precence of a preamp.
			<li>LT: A higher end early version of the XL it seems. Example: Dinky LT
			<li>AR: Early archtop body, HSH. Example: Dinky AR
			<li>SS: Early Fusion HSS with dots and single volume knob.
			<li>SX: Early HSH Fusion with single volume knob.
			<li>Reverse RVS, RVH: Line of reverse headstock Dinky models, shortly becoming the DR later in the 90s.
			<li>SP: Early plain model Dinky with dots and HSH pickups or Fusion with HS pickups and dots.
			<li>HH: Two humbuckers.
			<li>V: Five string concert bass
			<li>HX:Means TOM string-thru body and humbuckers, three for the Stealth or two for the rare Dinky HX.
			<li>Plus: A early version of the HH. Example: Fusion Plus
		</ul>
	
	<h2>-Concept subcategories-</h2>

		<p>1994-95 MIJ budget models that became Performers later.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>JRR: A Rhoads with TOM string-thru body. Later became Performer PS3T
			<li>JDR: A Dinky Reverse HSH. Later became Performer PS4
			<li>JSX: A Stealth. Didn't directly become anything as the Stealth TH1 and TH2 succeeding it are different.
			<li>JDX: A HSS Dinky with a telecaster style fixed bridge. Unique model.
		</ul>

	<h2>-Grover Jackson and Jackson Stars-</h2>
	
		<p>They have their own schemes it seems and catalogs not being in English doesn't help! Here's what I have so far:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Various numbers: Vaguely a rank with higher numbers being the higher end.
			<li>HH: Two humbuckers
			<li>SSH: two single coils, one hum
			<li>U.S.: US custom shop
			<li>L: Left handed
			<li>SL: Soloist

			<li>AH: Ambition heat. Just a mid 90s series.
			<li>E: Indicates EMG on later Jackson Stars
			<li>B: TOM bridge on later Jackson Stars
			<li>K: Kahler bridge on later Jackson Stars
			<li>J: ??For Jackson Stars means possibly Japan made?
			<li>TN: Seems to be a later version of J for Jackson Stars. Basically it's an import.
		</ul>

Enjoy while it lasts.</p>
		
		<p><a href="https://www.jcfonline.com/">Jcfonline.com</a>.This is the ONLY somewhat alive location dedicated to these guitars. Images are often broken due to file hosting issues. There's a wealth of info but buried deep. There are a mix of old timer contributors and hit and run 'ask a question in a topic and never return' members. That's not bad, but it does mean that threads will stagnate quickly. </p>
