	<h3>First some facts or myths or whatever else is worth noting:</h3>

		<p><b>- Body size: Is it 7/8 of a Stratocaster?</b> Soloists and Dinky’s have a smaller body, but be aware Jackson had 'strat style' guitars in the 80s with a strat body. Check the 1988 Catalog for example. Guitars with 22 frets as opposed to the typical 24 frets will have an altered body shape.</p>


		<p><b>-(Concerning older 90s era Jacksons) Does the right lower horn cutout mean it’s a short scale Fusion?</b> Good catch, but no. Charvel was kind of doing this for a moment so that the  horn scoop signified Charvel and Charvette 24.75 scale guitars. While Jackson would continue that on their Fusion line they would also use it on other guitars, such as the Dinky Reverse line and later some DK2s.</p>

		<p><b>-Are all of the Profession line guitars the prized USA killers?</b> Only the top models that ended with a ‘Pro’, not to be confused with “Professional” were the ones with the highest specs and the ebony fretboards. To make it clearer, a Rhoads Professional could be a EX, and STD, or a Pro. Only the ‘Rhoads Professional Pro’ is the top one. That being said, the entire line of MIJ guitars, especially the ones made before the line was fizzled out, are amazing intruments.</p>
		
		<p><b>-Professional subcategories:</b> Pro was the highest level unless there were other special editions. You got the ebony fingerboards, MOP inlays, the highest quality pickups, bridge, and hardware, the best finish options, and extra active electronics if available. They are the ‘USA’ killers. The XL versions had the general looks of the Pros but with rosewood and lesser electronics. You still had real MOP inlays but not the Jackson logo. When you remember that the overall craftsmanship on these is very high it’s not very far off. STD or ‘standard’ were under XL and had a plainer appearance such as dot inlays. Typically  however hardware and electronics are identical. Use this to acquire them cheaper since some may misidentify the plain appearance as something cheaper. EX were the most basic and is where it gets interesting as there aren’t any standards. A Dinky EX has a completely different setup than a STD with 22 frets vs 24 and HSH pickups vs HSS. a Rhoads EX is different construction (bolt-on vs neck-thru) than a Rhoads Std. Yet a Concert bass EX is… exactly identical in everyway to a Concert XL except sharkfin inlays!! </p>

		<p>Here’s some other oddball Professional suffixes you’ll find. The Fusion line has a LT, SS, SP, Plus and SX. See their entries for details. Dinkys have AR, SP, RV-S, RV-H, and HX. Stealths have a HX and a LT but it isn’t really related to the Fusion LT. Think they ran out of suffixes? Me too!</p>
		
		<p><b>-Later Jackson Subcategories:</b> Custom shop is ‘Custom Select’ or 'Masterbuilt' if more premium. A guitar is customized based on templates offered for various models. Regular production USA made Jackson become ‘USA Selects’ in modern times. Expect top level hardware, pickups, and all finish options. The highest imports become Pro Series. In the past this would be MIJ, like the ‘Professional Series’ but now may be other countries such as Mexican or Indonesian. They have good pickups, top hardware and other upper options like ebony fret boards. ‘X Series’ are mid level imports. Originally Japanese these may also be from Indonesia or China. Expect mid range pickups and hardware such as Floyd Rose Specials. ‘Artist Signature’ may been somewhere in between the Por or X series depending on guitar. ‘JS Series’ are value range starting late 90s. They sport cheaper Jackson branded pickups and hardware. Initially they had extremely basic appearances but later Jackson refreshed the line with more premium and better looking specifications.</p>

<a id="soloist">
<h3>Jackson Soloist: Jackson’s other signature model (see Rhoads entry), these are neck-thru superstrats. The first was completed August 28, 1984. Early distinctions were between the Soloist Custom: neck-thru, 24 frets, ebony, bound fretboard, and ‘sharkfins’ or pearl dots and Soloists Student: the same but rosewood, no binding, and pearl dots only. Both of course were of equal quality. Floyd Rose, Kahler, and string through body were some options and Seymour Duncan’s were stock until 1985 when Jackson started to use in-house wound pickups. The finishes were pretty much whatever. Ontario era brings some changes such as the JT-6 bridge and an archtop option. In 1990 Soloists became a regular production model. An asterisk means that the model or specs of such are dubious and clarification or further research is needed.</h3>

			<li><b>Jackson Soloist ATT Pro:</b> An archtop ‘Professional’ guitar with the tremolo option. Noteworthy is the 24.75 scale, though you’d never know it from the title.

Poplar body, Takeuchi JT-580 LP tremolo, rosewood board with pearl dots, Jackson J-92C and J-100Vs pickups. One volume tone and three-way.

They have a mahogany body, a different body shape than usual, a bound rosewood board with no inlays, a different headstock shape, a Gotoh tune-omatic bridge, and depending on the year, 24 or 22 frets. The pickups vary from a set of Dimarzio DP100 or Duncan Pearly Gates/Jazz combo. Finishes are burnt cherry sunburst, trans blue, and black. This guitar is only from 1997- 98 and is not to be confused with later ‘Super Light’ Soloists below.

<h3>Jackson King V: This is an aggressively styled guitar named after ‘King’ Robbin Crosby of Ratt. The V-shaped design spawned from a custom Jackson he’d play, a ‘Double Rhoads’ (a V guitar comprised of the ‘long’ wings of a Rhoads. This was never a regular production model). Later Dave Mustaine would be the face of this guitar among others. The King V was designed as a smaller version of the Double Rhoads to accompany more average sized players. These guitars are traditionally two humbucker designs with a tremolo, but not always. Other design specs vary as well, such as 24 or 22 frets, knob/control configurations, the fretboard, etc.</h3>

<h3>Jackson Warrior: An X shaped guitar with each point resembling a Jackson headstock. Introduced late 1989 and designed by Mikey Wright, a Jackson R&D, the shape was discontinued (and apparently unpopular) a year later after the USA and Pro models. In 2001 however, it was reissued and continued to be a brutal design earning its namesake. Usual specs include 24 frets, fast Jackson neck, a tremolo, and two humbucking pickups. Unique to the initial models, the USA and Pro are the 24.75 scale and have three slanted in reverse rail pickups. See Links section for more history.</h3>

<h3>Jackson Concert Bass: A four string bass Jackson offered at least as early as 1984. The classic Concert Bass is a four string 34  inch scale neck-thru or bolt-on bass with 21 frets using a p-bass (J-20) neck pickup and a jazz single coil (J-150) or humbucking (varied) bridge pickup along with the J-2000 Bass preamp later. It has the ‘custom’ and ‘student’ options as did many classic custom shop Jacksons. During the 90s the Concert bass had three ‘Professional’ series variants and a ‘Performer’. In 1998 the line was drastically redesigned into several four and five string variants, passive and active. In 2002 it received another redesign as the CMG Concert bass and finally in 2012 using a similar look to the previous the current JS and X Series Concert basses.</h3>

You can click and get stories about the guitar, since we're talking custom shop stuff here. My only issues is that it is zombie. The forums are dead and lots of the external links are long gone. Enjoy while it lasts.</p>
		
		<p><a href="https://www.jcfonline.com/">Jcfonline.com</a>.This is the ONLY somewhat alive location dedicated to these guitars. Images are often broken due to file hosting issues. There's a wealth of info but buried deep. There are a mix of old timer contributors and hit and run 'ask a question in a topic and never return' members. That's not bad, but it does mean that threads will stagnate quickly. </p>
