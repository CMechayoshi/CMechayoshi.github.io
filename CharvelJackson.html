	<h1>The Charvel and Jackson Page (Under Construction)</h1>

		<p>Intro: <em>*UPDATE. I've removed the style tag for this page so the information is readable. It won't be ugly forever.</em> I'm a huge fan of these guitars. This will be a database of all good sources of info along with my personal collections and discoveries.</p>
		
		<h3>Personal Collection</h3>

		<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13JTcEG8dZJlPDRJrV9yhnYzPxdy_mZpP?usp=sharing">My personal album.</a> Please note that most of these images weren't meant to document anything initially, just images I took at the time so excuse poor camera work. Guitars seen are Charvette 400 bass, Charvel Model 1B, Charvel Model 2B, Jackson Concert Bass EX, Charvel Model 4B, Jackson RR3, Dinky Std, a hard to find these days Jackson guitar soft case, and lastly my Charvel Fusion Custom. See the album for individual comments.</p>
		
<HR>		
		
	<h2>-Database-</h2>
	
	<h3>First some facts or myths or whatever else is worth noting:</h3>

		<p><b>- Body size: Is it 7/8 of a Stratocaster?</b> Soloists and Dinky’s have a smaller body, but be aware Jackson had 'strat style' guitars in the 80s with a strat body. Check the 1988 Catalog for example. Guitars with 22 frets as opposed to the typical 24 frets will have an altered body shape.</p>


		<p><b>-(Concerning older 90s era Jacksons) Does the right lower horn cutout mean it’s a short scale Fusion?</b> Good catch, but no. Charvel was kind of doing this for a moment so that the  horn scoop signified Charvel and Charvette 24.75 scale guitars. While Jackson would continue that on their Fusion line they would also use it on other guitars, such as the Dinky Reverse line and later some DK2s.</p>

		<p><b>-Are all of the Profession line guitars the prized USA killers?</b> Only the top models that ended with a ‘Pro’, not to be confused with “Professional” were the ones with the highest specs and the ebony fretboards. To make it clearer, a Rhoads Professional could be a EX, and STD, or a Pro. Only the ‘Rhoads Professional Pro’ is the top one. That being said, the entire line of MIJ guitars, especially the ones made before the line was fizzled out, are amazing intruments.</p>
		
		<p><b>-Professional subcategories:</b> Pro was the highest level unless there were other special editions. You got the ebony fingerboards, MOP inlays, the highest quality pickups, bridge, and hardware, the best finish options, and extra active electronics if available. They are the ‘USA’ killers. The XL versions had the general looks of the Pros but with rosewood and lesser electronics. You still had real MOP inlays but not the Jackson logo. When you remember that the overall craftsmanship on these is very high it’s not very far off. STD or ‘standard’ were under XL and had a plainer appearance such as dot inlays. Typically  however hardware and electronics are identical. Use this to acquire them cheaper since some may misidentify the plain appearance as something cheaper. EX were the most basic and is where it gets interesting as there aren’t any standards. A Dinky EX has a completely different setup than a STD with 22 frets vs 24 and HSH pickups vs HSS. a Rhoads EX is different construction (bolt-on vs neck-thru) than a Rhoads Std. Yet a Concert bass EX is… exactly identical in everyway to a Concert XL except sharkfin inlays!! </p>

		<p>Here’s some other oddball Professional suffixes you’ll find. The Fusion line has a LT, SS, SP, Plus and SX. See their entries for details. Dinkys have AR, SP, RV-S, RV-H, and HX. Stealths have a HX and a LT but it isn’t really related to the Fusion LT. Think they ran out of suffixes? Me too!</p>
		
		<p><b>-Later Jackson Subcategories:</b> Custom shop is ‘Custom Select’ or 'Masterbuilt' if more premium. A guitar is customized based on templates offered for various models. Regular production USA made Jackson become ‘USA Selects’ in modern times. Expect top level hardware, pickups, and all finish options. The highest imports become Pro Series. In the past this would be MIJ, like the ‘Professional Series’ but now may be other countries such as Mexican or Indonesian. They have good pickups, top hardware and other upper options like ebony fret boards. ‘X Series’ are mid level imports. Originally Japanese these may also be from Indonesia or China. Expect mid range pickups and hardware such as Floyd Rose Specials. ‘Artist Signature’ may been somewhere in between the Por or X series depending on guitar. ‘JS Series’ are value range starting late 90s. They sport cheaper Jackson branded pickups and hardware. Initially they had extremely basic appearances but later Jackson refreshed the line with more premium and better looking specifications.</p>

	<h3>Jackson Soloist: Jackson’s signature model, these are always neckthru style super-strats. The first was completed August 28, 1984 however San Dimas examples were made to order with no set rules. Eventually early distinctions were between the Soloist Custom: neck-thru, 24 frets, ebony, bound fretboard, and ‘sharkfins’ or pearl dots and Soloists Student: the same but rosewood, no binding, and pearl dots only. Both of course were of equal quality. Floyd Rose, Kahler, and string through body were some options and Seymour Duncan’s were stock until 1985 when Jackson started to use in-house wound pickups. The finishes were pretty much whatever. Ontario era brings some changes such as the JT-6 bridge and an archtop option. In 1990 Soloists became a regular production model which we can conveniently break down below.(Sources used for above:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Soloist)">wiki</a>) An asterisk means that the model or specs of such are dubious and clarification or further research is needed.</h3>
	
	
		<ul>
			<li><b>Jackson Soloist (80s Custom shop):</b>A customizable Soloist from the 80s. Ebony or rosewood fretboard options with pearl sharkfins or dots. Biding on the 'Custom' model. Reverse headstock was an option, and the pickups and tone controls as well. One could use blade or mini switches and use passive or Jackson's active controls. Action options included the JE-1000, JE-1200, and JE-1500 boosts and sweeping controls. Finish options: solid, metal flake, sunburst, metallic, crackle, candy, pearl, custom graphics
			
			<li><b>Jackson Soloist Custom:</b> USA Soloist, pre-SL1. Basswood body with optional flame top. Bound ebony fretboard with pearl shark-fin inlays.

Introduced in 1996- 98 is Poplar, a wood a lot of old Charvel/Jackson stuff would be if not Basswood, but since 1999 they are Alder. This is a current model but they now call it ‘USA Select Soloist SL1’ so don’t get confused. The Finishes: Black, agent orange, bolted steel, Ferrari Red, Burnt Cherry Sunburst, Lightning sky, Gun metal grey, natural, Nebula, Metallic black, Trans black, shattered glass, snow white, trans blue, snakeskin, Quicksilver, Trans green, Copper Snakeskin, Darby green, trans red, Yellow bengal, Absinthe frost, blue ghost flames, Acapulco Gold, black ghost flames, pile o' skulls, deep candy red, Eerie dess swirl. The left handed version doesn't seem to have a unique name.
			
			<li><b>Jackson Soloist SL1T</b>: Same as above but with string thru body option. 
			
			<li><b>Jackson Soloist SL2 (USA):</b> This is a USA Soloist with two humbuckers (Jackson JP-10, JP-11), ebony found board with either sharks or no markers, a JT-580 LP bridge, and a three way toggle. Finishes were BLK(Black), GMG(Gun Metal Gray), BGP(Blue Green Pearl), YGP(Yellow/Gold Pearl), DCR(Deep Candy Red). The wood is poplar.
			
			<li><b>SL2:</b> What, again? Jackson later made this an import ‘Pro Series’ and gave it piranha inlays, direct mount pickups, and with Duncan Distortion Mayhem Humbuckers. Yes this is a ‘switcheroo’ model where the various iterations are really different guitars. Now the body wood is mahogany and fretboard ebony. Colors are black, caramel burl (SL2P), deep purple metallic, red mercury, and more, some with matching headstocks. Floyd Rose 1000.

			<li><b>SL2Q:</b> The 'Q' the end means quilttop model. Finishes: winterstorm, trans green, Caribbean fade blue, and desert sunset sky
			
			<li><b>Jackson Soloist SL2H:</b> Again again? This is another guitar, yes. You have 24 frets, sharkfins MOP, ebony board, mahogany wings, a OFR, and Seymour Duncan. There are lots of finish options. 
			
			<li><b>SL2HT:</b> Fixed bridge of above. 
			
			<li><b>SL2H-MAH:</b>Mahogany body SL2. Finishes: Burnt cherry sunburst, natural, trans black, trans blue, trans red.
			
			<li><b>SL2H-MAHQ:</b>Quilt top option. Finsihes: Burnt cherry sunburst, natural, tans black, trans blue, trans green, trans red.
			
			<li><b>Jackson Soloist SL3:</b> ‘Pro Series’ so MIJ import then later Indonesia. 24 frets, rosewood with sharkfins, with an alder body, HSS set up with hotrail Duncans and a bridge JB. The fretboard is rosewood and the tremolo a JT-580. The Indonesian ones have piranha inlays, ebony fretboard, mahogany body, and the Floyd Rose 1000 with the Seymour Duncan’s being changed to TB-6 and SSL-6. 
			
			<li><b>SL3MG:</b> A ‘MG Series’ version of the above with a HH EMG 81/85 set installed. 
			
			<li><b>Jackson Soloist SL3X:</b> An ‘X Series’ so an Indonesian import. Features 24 frets, rosewood with sharkfins, Floyd Rose Special, and Duncan Designed HB103B and HR101. One volume tone and five way blade. 
			
			<li><b>SL3X DX:</b> ‘X series’ but with 80s crackle finishes. Other differences is Jackson branded pickups. Comes and gold and silver crackle finishes.
			
			<li><b>Jackson Soloist SL4:</b> A MIJ import notable for its 22 frets and high quality. It has a rosewood board with sharks, Seymour Duncan JB and TB4, a JT580LP, and Alder body. It had a short early 2000s only run.
			
			<li><b>SL4X:</b> An ‘X Series’ import based on the famous Charvel Spectrum. 24 frets, maple neck, bound rosewood board with dots, and three Duncan Design hot rails with a Floyd Rose Special. There are bright 80’s inspired finishes available, a blue, pink, white, orange, and a natural, along with black. The blackguards can be white or black.
			
			<li><b>Jackson Soloist SLXDX:</b> A newer ‘X Series’ Soloist. Basswood body, laurel fretboard with pearloid sharkfin inlay. Floyd Rose Special tremolo, Jackson high-output HH pickups. Finishes: satin white swirl, rocket red, satin black, snow white
			
			<li><b>Shannon Soloist, SHS1:</b> Something special with some particular specs. USA, 24 frets, poplar body, ebony fretboard with MOP sharkfins, Seymour Duncan SHPG-1 and SSL-5 custom, and a OFR that isn’t recessed. Limited edition, they feature a signature, unscalloped neck heel, fret nibs, and a few other small things. Finishes are black, slime green white, blue ghost flames, and possibly sherbet orange.
			
			<li><b>Jackson Soloist Limited '91 professional</b>: Celebrating their 12th year anniversary this archtop Soloist was limited to 200. This is MIJ and high quality as expected. Mahogany wings and flamed top, bound Brazilian rosewood, MOP shark fins and Jackson logo with a limited marker at the twelve fret, a gold JT-590 tremolo, Reflex Silver HH pickups, and 1 volume, 1 tone, and three way toggle. The finishes were antique cherryburst or tobaccoburst. Retail was $2450.
			
			<li><b>Jackson Soloist Pro professional:</b> The highest ‘Professional’ series. MIJ. Features poplar body, Schaller JT-590 tremolo, bound ebony fretboard, MOP sharkfins, and Jackson J-50m and J-200 pickups in HSS. The Jackson mid-boost circuit (JE-1200) is present so that’s what the third knob does if you ever find one. They were made from 1990-95.
			
			<li><b>Jackson Soloist ATT Pro:</b> An archtop ‘Professional’ guitar with the tremolo option. Noteworthy is the 24.75 scale, though you’d never know it from the title. I suppose since it was neck-thru Jackson chose to classify it as a Soloist rather than Fusion. Anyway, the body is mahogany with a maple top, Jt-590 tremolo, bound ebony fretboard with reverse MOP sharkfin inlays, two J-90c pickups, and three way toggle. Only made from 1990-92. Finishes were trans amber, trans red, trans blue, and cherry sunburst. Retailed for $1695.
			
			<li>Jackson Soloist ATN Pro:</b> The above but with a string-through-body tune-o-matic bridge and slightly lesser price of $1595. This makes this one a bit closer to the Gibson LP. All other specs remain identical. 

			<li><b>Jackson Soloist XL professional:</b> A ‘Professional’ Soloist with typical XL designated features. Poplar body, JT-590 tremolo, MOP sharkfin inlays, bound rosewood, and J-92C and J-100VS pickups. One volume tone and fiveway toggle. Finishes: pearl white, metallic black, deep metallic blue, deep metallic red. 1992-95.
			
			<li><b>Jackson Soloist Std professional:</b> Is that other stuff above too fancy? This ‘Professional’ Soloist has you covered. Poplar body, Takeuchi JT-580 LP tremolo, rosewood board with pearl dots, Jackson J-92C and J-100Vs pickups. One volume tone and three-way. This is the same specs and quality as the above, save perhaps for the tremolo. Take advantage of that to score deals. 1993-95.
			
			<li><b>Jackson Soloist SLX:</b>An Indonesian mid-level ‘X Series’ import. Basswood body, Floyd Rose special, Pearl sharkfins, Duncan Designed HB103B and HB103N HH pickups, vol tone and three way. Options include Zebra wood and koa tops. The neck is either bound rosewood or laurel but consider that the same really. Finishes are black, natural, kawasabi green, snow white, slime gree, taxi cab yellow, metallic red, the wood tops, green and red crackle.
			
			<li><b>Jackson Soloist SLXLH:</b>Left handed ‘X Series’ import. Same as above but with less finish options. Finishes: satin black, trans black.

They have a mahogany body, a different body shape than usual, a bound rosewood board with no inlays, a different headstock shape, a Gotoh tune-omatic bridge, and depending on the year, 24 or 22 frets. The pickups vary from a set of Dimarzio DP100 or Duncan Pearly Gates/Jazz combo. Finishes are burnt cherry sunburst, trans blue, and black. This guitar is only from 1997- 98 and is not to be confused with later ‘Super Light’ Soloists below. 
		
			<li><b>Jackson Soloist SLS2*:</b>A USA made ‘Super Light’ Soloist. I could not get concrete specs on this one so the following is based off of a single ad I found. String through body tune-o-matic. HH set up with Seymour Duncan JB ‘59 and TB-4. Bound rosewood fretboard with MOP sharkfins. No idea on the finish.

Perhaps to take on a more Gibson-ish tone, many of these featured humbucking/rail pickups in the neck and middle positions. The firsts were the Charvel Fusions in 1989 then in 1990 the Charvettes and the Jackson USA and MIJ Pro Fusions. The last was the Fusion ‘FX1’ from around 1996. Note: the Charvette line does not label as “Fusion”, see their entries under the ‘Charvette’ section. The Fusion basses also disregard all of the above rules.</h3>
