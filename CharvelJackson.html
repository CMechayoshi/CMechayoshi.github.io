	<h1>The Charvel and Jackson Page (Under Construction)</h1>

		<p>Intro: <em>*UPDATE. I've removed the style tag for this page so the information is readable. It won't be ugly forever.</em> I'm a huge fan of these guitars. This will be a database of all good sources of info along with my personal collections and discoveries.</p>
		
		<h3>Personal Collection</h3>

		<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13JTcEG8dZJlPDRJrV9yhnYzPxdy_mZpP?usp=sharing">My personal album.</a> Please note that most of these images weren't meant to document anything initially, just images I took at the time so excuse poor camera work. Guitars seen are Charvette 400 bass, Charvel Model 1B, Charvel Model 2B, Jackson Concert Bass EX, Charvel Model 4B, Jackson RR3, Dinky Std, a hard to find these days Jackson guitar soft case, and lastly my Charvel Fusion Custom. See the album for individual comments.</p>

	<h2>-Database-</h2>
	
	<h3>First some facts or myths or whatever else is worth noting:</h3>

		<p><b>- Body size: Is it 7/8 of a Stratocaster?</b> The answer is yes!.. With a footnote. Most Soloists and Dinky’s have a smaller body, thus the strat reference but remember that not all ‘Soloist’ and ‘Dinky’ guitars have had the same body size we think of today. The earliest Soloists were strat bodies, and in the same era Jackson made bolt on ‘dinky’ style guitars that again used normal strat body. Soloists and Dinky’s are the same body shape but this depends on the number of frets. 22 fret versions are shaped differently, especially near the horn area. This is hard to observe in a Soloists but to see it on a Dinky just look at any of the low end older JS series imports.</p>


		<p><b>-(Concerning older 90s era Jacksons) Does the right lower horn cutout mean it’s a short scale Fusion?</b> Good catch, but no. While it is true that the  horn scoop signified Charvel and Charvette 24.75 scale guitars, Jackson would continue that on their Fusion line but also use it on certain Dinky guitars, such as the Dinky Reverse line and later some DK2s.</p>

		<p><b>-Are all of the Profession line guitars the prized USA killers?</b> Only the top models that ended with a ‘Pro’, not to be confused with “Professional” were the ones with the highest specs and the ebony fretboards. To make it clearer, a Rhoads Professional could be a EX, and STD, or a Pro. Only the ‘Rhoads Professional Pro’ is the top one. That being said, the entire line of MIJ guitars, especially the ones made before the line was fizzled out, are amazing intruments.</p>
		
		<p><b>-Professional subcategories:</b> Pro was the highest level unless there were other special editions. You got the ebony fingerboards, MOP inlays, the highest quality pickups, bridge, and hardware, the best finish options, and extra active electronics if available. They are the ‘USA’ killers. The XL versions had the general looks of the Pros but with rosewood and lesser electronics. You still had real MOP inlays but not the Jackson logo. When you remember that the overall craftsmanship on these is very high it’s not very far off. STD or ‘standard’ were under XL and had a plainer appearance such as dot inlays. Typically  however hardware and electronics are identical. Use this to acquire them cheaper since some may misidentify the plain appearance as something cheaper. EX were the most basic and is where it gets interesting as there aren’t any standards. A Dinky EX has a completely different setup than a STD with 22 frets vs 24 and HSH pickups vs HSS. a Rhoads EX is different construction (bolt-on vs neck-thru) than a Rhoads Std. Yet a Concert bass EX is… exactly identical in everyway to a Concert XL except sharkfin inlays!! </p>

		<p>Here’s some other oddball Professional suffixes you’ll find. The Fusion line has a LT, SS, SP, Plus and SX. See their entries for details. Dinkys have AR, SP, RV-S, RV-H, and HX. Stealths have a HX and a LT but it isn’t really related to the Fusion LT. Think they ran out of suffixes? Me too!</p>
		
		<p><b>-Later Jackson Subcategories:</b> Custom shop is ‘Custom Select’ or 'Masterbuilt' if more premium. A guitar is customized based on templates offered for various models. Regular production USA made Jackson become ‘USA Selects’ in modern times. Expect top level hardware, pickups, and all finish options. The highest imports become Pro Series. In the past this would be MIJ, like the ‘Professional Series’ but now may be other countries such as Mexican or Indonesian. They have good pickups, top hardware and other upper options like ebony fret boards. ‘X Series’ are mid level imports. Originally Japanese these may also be from Indonesia or China. Expect mid range pickups and hardware such as Floyd Rose Specials. ‘Artist Signature’ may been somewhere in between the Por or X series depending on guitar. ‘JS Series’ are value range starting late 90s. They sport cheaper Jackson branded pickups and hardware. Initially they had extremely basic appearances but later Jackson refreshed the line with more premium and better looking specifications.</p>

	<p><b>Soloist:</b> Jackson’s signature model, these are always neckthru style super-strats. The first was completed August 28, 1984 however San Dimas examples were made to order with no set rules. Eventually early distinctions were between the Soloist Custom: neck-thru, 24 frets, ebony, bound fretboard, and ‘sharkfins’ or pearl dots and Soloists Student: the same but rosewood, no binding, and pearl dots only. Both of course were of equal quality. Floyd Rose, Kahler, and string through body were some options and Seymour Duncan’s were stock until 1985 when Jackson started to use in-house wound pickups. The finishes were pretty much whatever. Ontario era brings some changes such as the JT-6 bridge and an archtop option. In 1990 Soloists became a regular production model which we can conveniently break down below.(Sources used for above:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Soloist)">wiki</a>) An asterisk means that the model or specs of such are dubious and clarification or further research is needed.</p>
	
	
		<ul>
			<li><b>Jackson Soloist SL1 :</b> This is a USA flagship Soloist. Features 24 frets, sharks, an OFR, an ebony bound board, maple neck, HSS pickup config, and Seymour Duncan (TB-4 and STK-S1). Introduced in 1996- 98 is Poplar, a wood a lot of old Charvel/Jackson stuff would be if not Basswood, but since 1999 they are Alder. This is a current model but they now call it ‘USA Select Soloist SL1’ so don’t get confused. The Finishes: Black, agent orange, bolted steel, Ferrari Red, Burnt Cherry Sunburst, Lightning sky, Gun metal grey, natural, Nebula, Metallic black, Trans black, shattered glass, snow white, trans blue, snakeskin, Quicksilver, Trans green, Copper Snakeskin, Darby green, trans red, Yellow bengal, Absinthe frost, blue ghost flames, Acapulco Gold, black ghost flames, pile o' skulls, deep candy red, Eerie dess swirl. The left handed version doesn't seem to have a unique name.
			
			<li><b>Jackson Soloist SL1T</b>: Same as above but with string thru body option. 
			
			<li><b>Jackson Soloist SL2 (USA):</b> This is a USA Soloist with two humbuckers (Jackson JP-10, JP-11), ebony found board with either sharks or no markers, a JT-580 LP bridge, and a three way toggle. Finishes were BLK(Black), GMG(Gun Metal Gray), BGP(Blue Green Pearl), YGP(Yellow/Gold Pearl), DCR(Deep Candy Red). The wood is poplar.
			
			<li><b>SL2:</b> What, again? Jackson later made this an import ‘Pro Series’ and gave it piranha inlays, direct mount pickups, and with Duncan Distortion Mayhem Humbuckers. Yes this is a ‘switcheroo’ model where the various iterations are really different guitars. Now the body wood is mahogany and fretboard ebony. Colors are black, caramel burl (SL2P), deep purple metallic, and more, some with matching headstocks. Floyd Rose 1000.

			<li><b>SL2Q:</b> The 'Q' the end means quilttop model. Finishes: winterstorm, trans green, Caribbean fade blue, and desert sunset sky
			
			<li><b>Jackson Soloist SL2H:</b> Again again? This is another guitar, yes. You have 24 frets, sharkfins MOP, ebony board, mahogany wings, a OFR, and Seymour Duncan. There are lots of finish options. 
			
			<li><b>SL2HT:</b> Fixed bridge of above. 
			
			<li><b>SL2H-MAH:</b>Mahogany body SL2. Finishes: Burnt cherry sunburst, natural, trans black, trans blue, trans red.
			
			<li><b>SL2H-MAHQ:</b>Quilt top option. Finsihes: Burnt cherry sunburst, natural, tans black, trans blue, trans green, trans red.
			
			<li><b>Jackson Soloist SL3:</b> ‘Pro Series’ so MIJ import then later Indonesia. 24 frets, rosewood with sharkfins, with an alder body, HSS set up with hotrail Duncans and a bridge JB. The fretboard is rosewood and the tremolo a JT-580. The Indonesian ones have piranha inlays, ebony fretboard, mahogany body, and the Floyd Rose 1000 with the Seymour Duncan’s being changed to TB-6 and SSL-6. 
			
			<li><b>SL3MG:</b> A ‘MG Series’ version of the above with a HH EMG 81/85 set installed. 
			
			<li><b>Jackson Soloist SL3X:</b> An ‘X Series’ so an Indonesian import. Features 24 frets, rosewood with sharkfins, Floyd Rose Special, and Duncan Designed HB103B and HR101. One volume tone and five way blade. 
			
			<li><b>SL3X DX:</b> ‘X series’ but with 80s crackle finishes. Other differences is Jackson branded pickups. Comes and gold and silver crackle finishes.
			
			<li><b>Jackson Soloist SL4:</b> A MIJ import notable for its 22 frets and high quality. It has a rosewood board with sharks, Seymour Duncan JB and TB4, a JT580LP, and Alder body. It had a short early 2000s only run.
			
			<li><b>SL4X:</b> An ‘X Series’ import based on the famous Charvel Spectrum. 24 frets, maple neck, bound rosewood board with dots, and three Duncan Design hot rails with a Floyd Rose Special. There are bright 80’s inspired finishes available, a blue, pink, white, orange, and a natural, along with black. The blackguards can be white or black.
			
			<li><b>Shannon Soloist, SHS1:</b> Something special with some particular specs. USA, 24 frets, poplar body, ebony fretboard with MOP sharkfins, Seymour Duncan SHPG-1 and SSL-5 custom, and a OFR that isn’t recessed. Limited edition, they feature a signature, unscalloped neck heel, fret nibs, and a few other small things. Finishes are black, slime green white, blue ghost flames, and possibly sherbet orange.
			
			<li><b>Jackson Soloist Limited '91 professional</b>: Celebrating their 12th year anniversary this archtop Soloist was limited to 200. This is MIJ and high quality as expected. Mahogany wings and flamed top, bound Brazilian rosewood, MOP shark fins and Jackson logo with a limited marker at the twelve fret, a gold JT-590 tremolo, Reflex Silver HH pickups, and 1 volume, 1 tone, and three way toggle. The finishes were antique cherryburst or tobaccoburst. Retail was $2450.
			
			<li><b>Jackson Soloist Pro professional:</b> The highest ‘Professional’ series. MIJ. Features poplar body, Schaller JT-590 tremolo, bound ebony fretboard, MOP sharkfins, and Jackson J-50m and J-200 pickups in HSS. The Jackson mid-boost circuit (JE-1200) is present so that’s what the third knob does if you ever find one. They were made from 1990-95.
			
			<li><b>Jackson Soloist ATT Pro:</b> An archtop ‘Professional’ guitar with the tremolo option. Noteworthy is the 24.75 scale, though you’d never know it from the title. I suppose since it was neck-thru Jackson chose to classify it as a Soloist rather than Fusion. Anyway, the body is mahogany with a maple top, Jt-590 tremolo, bound ebony fretboard with reverse MOP sharkfin inlays, two J-90c pickups, and three way toggle. Only made from 1990-92. Finishes were trans amber, trans red, trans blue, and cherry sunburst. Retailed for $1695.
			
			<li>Jackson Soloist ATN Pro:</b> The above but with a string-through-body tune-o-matic bridge and slightly lesser price of $1595. This makes this one a bit closer to the Gibson LP. All other specs remain identical. 

			<li><b>Jackson Soloist XL professional:</b> A ‘Professional’ Soloist with typical XL designated features. Poplar body, JT-590 tremolo, MOP sharkfin inlays, bound rosewood, and J-92C and J-100VS pickups. One volume tone and fiveway toggle. Finishes: pearl white, metallic black, deep metallic blue, deep metallic red. 1992-95.
			
			<li><b>Jackson Soloist Std professional:</b> Is that other stuff above too fancy? This ‘Professional’ Soloist has you covered. Poplar body, Takeuchi JT-580 LP tremolo, rosewood board with pearl dots, Jackson J-92C and J-100Vs pickups. One volume tone and three-way. This is the same specs and quality as the above, save perhaps for the tremolo. Take advantage of that to score deals. 1993-95.
			
			<li><b>Jackson Soloist SLX:</b>An Indonesian mid-level ‘X Series’ import. Basswood body, Floyd Rose special, Pearl sharkfins, Duncan Designed HB103B and HB103N HH pickups, vol tone and three way. Options include Zebra wood and koa tops. The neck is either bound rosewood or laurel but consider that the same really. Finishes are black, natural, kawasabi green, snow white, slime gree, taxi cab yellow, metallic red, the wood tops, green and red crackle.
			
			<li><b>Jackson Soloist SLXLH:</b>Left handed ‘X Series’ import. Same as above but with less finish options. Finishes: satin black, trans black.

			
			<li><b>Jackson Soloist SLXQ:</b>‘X Series’ Soloist with a quilt maple veneer. Same as above but with EMG HZ H4-B and H4-AN pickups. Burnt Cherry Sunburst is the finish.

			<li><b>ackson Soloist SLXTQ:</b>‘X Series’ Soloist. Same as above but with quilt top in natural finish. Duncan Designed pickups. 

			<li><b>Jackson Soloist SLS:</b> A USA made Soloist with a twist, it’s light weight! They have a mahogany body, a different body shape than usual, a bound rosewood board with no inlays, a different headstock shape, a Gotoh tune-omatic bridge, and depending on the year, 24 or 22 frets. The pickups vary from a set of Dimarzio DP100 or Duncan Pearly Gates/Jazz combo. Finishes are burnt cherry sunburst, trans blue, and black. This guitar is only from 1997- 98 and is not to be confused with later ‘Super Light’ Soloists below. 
		
			<li><b>Jackson Soloist SLS2*:</b>A USA made ‘Super Light’ Soloist. I could not get concrete specs on this one so the following is based off of a single ad I found.

	<p><b>Jackson Dinky:</b> Called ‘Dinky’ for the body size, they feature “a lighter body with high-speed playability” according to Jackson. These are bolt on guitars, otherwise identical to the Soloists in many flavors. Assume they have a compound radius 12” to 16” fretboard, maple bolt-on 24 fret neck, and standard volume, tone, and three or five way toggle unless otherwise noted. Asterisks mean more information and research is needed.

Basswood body, rosewood fretboard with MOP shark fin inlays, Schaller JT-590 or JT-580LP tremolo, and Jackson J-92C and J-100VS pickups.

		<li><b>Jackson Dinky Professional Std.*:</b> ‘Professional Series’ Dinky. Made from 1992-93. Rosewood fretboard with dot inlays that match the finish. Features a transparent pick-guard a’ la Ibanez Universe, though the electronics are still traditionally rear routed. Jackson 92C/J-100VS pickups and Schaller JT-590. This model is speced identically to the XL. From personal experience this has one of the thinnest necks of ANY Jackson. Finishes: Deep metallic red, candy blue, snow white, and supposedly black. I have never seen evidence of the black finish existing. There might be a variant of the white color with a white pickguard and pickguard mounted electronics, but I cannot verify.

Finishes: black, deep metallic violet, candy blue, stone, natural green sunburst, natural red sunburst, natural purple sunburst. From 1996 this was renamed the DR5 (see entry.)

HH Duncan Designed 103B/103N pickups. This model is frequently mislabeled if it lacks the Professional logo so an easy way to identify it is the presence of the three way toggle switch.

		<p><a href="https://guitarinside.com/Jackson_models">Guitarinside.com</a> So here were get some pretty extensive information on most but not all Jackson models, US and import. Because I can't get in contact with the owner, I may be duplicating and completing some missing info on my own as a junior collector. I am tracking some MISSING information below. Remember that this is not to criticize the site but for my personal reference:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Fails to list Jackson Dinky HX. A prototype of only 100. Source: 
			<a href="https://www.jcfonline.com/forum/equipment/import-jackson-guitars/33217-info-on-a-dinky-hx">(1)</a>
			<a href="https://www.jcfonline.com/forum/equipment/import-jackson-guitars/84789-how-much-is-my-dinky-hx-worth">(2)</a>
			<a href="https://www.jcfonline.com/forum/equipment/import-jackson-guitars/153256-ngd-jackson-professional-stealth-hx-japan">(3)</a>
			<a href="https://www.jcfonline.com/forum/equipment/import-jackson-guitars/85944-stealth-hx">(4)</a>
			
			<li>Fails to list Jackson DK2, DK2L, DK2M, DK2A, DK2T, DK2FF, DK3 and some related variants, mid range versions of the DK1 Dinky. Typically Made in Japan, but not always. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Dinky">Wiki link.</a>This link is good, better than you'd think, but not perfect as it lists the Dinky DR3 with the DK series. If you are unaware, the DR3 was the last iteration of the Jackson Professional Dinky Reverse line up, so it belongs with the older Professional MIJ Jacksons, not the newer "Pro Series" Jacksons from the 2000s. (Note that the later "Pro" Jacksons are typically MIJ too, but not all of these are, necessitating the distinction.
			
			
			<li>Fails to mention that later Jackson Concert EX bases have the lighter JB-340 bridge and ealier ones the heavy JB-440 bridge. (Stamped Jackson)
			
			<li>Does not mention the 'Super Dinky' SDK line, not to be confused with Japan only Super Dinky.

		<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180831174908/http://audiozone.dk/index-filer/jackson-pro-professional.php">Audiozone.dk Jackson Professional page</a>. The downfall of this site is part of my motivation to get this webpage together. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180831145043/http://audiozone.dk/index-filer/charvel-japan-import-guitars.php">Charvel page here.</a> Here is great information. Tremolo page <a href="http://audiozone.dk/index-filer/TremoloInfoProject.htm">here</a>.</p>
		
		
		<p><a href="http://charvelusa.com/models.html">ImportCharvel.com</a>. This is good because you can see the differnces between the years of the 80s import Charvels. I also like plentiful images and how it goes into the tricky Japanese domestic models. Be sure to click around. Though watermarked there are some great looking catalog scans here.</p>
		
		
		<p><a href="https://jacksoncharvel.fandom.com/wiki/Jackson_pickups">Jackson Charvel Wiki</a>. Here I link the pickups page because it's some what interesting. Overall not a fan of this place because there's hardly any articles and they're hard to find at that. Scattered and unfocused overall but feel free to dig around.</p>
		
		
		<p><a href="http://www.usacharvels.com/index.htm">Usacharvels.com</a>. Exactly what it sounds like with cool pictures. You can click and get stories about the guitar, since we're talking custom shop stuff here. My only issues is that it is zombie. The forums are dead and lots of the external links are long gone. Enjoy while it lasts.</p>
		
		<p><a href="https://www.jcfonline.com/">Jcfonline.com</a>.This is the only and I mean ONLY somewhat alive location dedicated to these guitars. Fortunately this is a forum. Unfortunately this is also a forum. Images are often broken due to file hosting issues. There's a wealth of info but buried deep. There are a mix of old timer contributors and hit and run 'ask a question in a topic and never return' members. That's not bad, but it does mean that threads will stagnate quiet. Still, it's about the best we got at the moment!</p>
