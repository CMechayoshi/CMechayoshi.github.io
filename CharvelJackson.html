	<h1>The Charvel and Jackson Page (Under Construction)</h1>

		<p>Intro: I'm a huge fan of these guitars. This will be a database of all good sources of info along with my personal collections and discoveries.</p>
		
		<h3>Personal Collection</h3>

		<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13JTcEG8dZJlPDRJrV9yhnYzPxdy_mZpP?usp=sharing">My personal album.</a> Please note that most of these images weren't meant to document anything initially, just images I took at the time so excuse poor camera work. Guitars seen are Charvette 400 bass, Charvel Model 1B, Charvel Model 2B, Jackson Concert Bass EX, Charvel Model 4B, Jackson RR3, Dinky Std, a hard to find these days Jackson guitar soft case, and lastly my Charvel Fusion Custom. See the album for individual comments.</p>

		<p><a href="https://guitarinside.com/Jackson_models">Guitarinside.com</a> So here were get some pretty extensive information on most but not all Jackson models, US and import. Because I can't get in contact with the owner, I may be duplicating and completing some missing info on my own as a junior collector. I am tracking some MISSING information below. Remember that this is not to criticize the site but for my personal reference:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Fails to list Jackson Dinky HX. A prototype of only 100. Source: 
			<a href="https://www.jcfonline.com/forum/equipment/import-jackson-guitars/33217-info-on-a-dinky-hx">(1)</a>
			<a href="https://www.jcfonline.com/forum/equipment/import-jackson-guitars/84789-how-much-is-my-dinky-hx-worth">(2)</a>
			<a href="https://www.jcfonline.com/forum/equipment/import-jackson-guitars/153256-ngd-jackson-professional-stealth-hx-japan">(3)</a>
			<a href="https://www.jcfonline.com/forum/equipment/import-jackson-guitars/85944-stealth-hx">(4)</a>
			
			<li>Fails to list Jackson DK2, DK2L, DK2M, DK2A, DK2T, DK2FF, DK3 and some related variants, mid range versions of the DK1 Dinky. Typically Made in Japan, but not always. The Wikipedia link is good, better than you'd think, but not perfect as it lists the Dinky DR3 with the DK series. If you are unaware, the DR3 was the last iteration of the Jackson Professional Dinky Reverse line up, so it belongs with the older Professional MIJ Jacksons, not the newer "Pro Series" Jacksons from the 2000s. (Note that the later "Pro" Jacksons are typically MIJ too, but not all of these are, necessitating the distinction.
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Dinky">Wiki link</a>
			
			<li>Fails to mention that later Jackson Concert EX bases have the lighter JB-340 bridge and ealier ones the heavy JB-440 bridge. (Stamped Jackson)
			
			<li>Does not mention the JT-6, common on older import Charvels but also some USA Jackson or the single locking Schaller JT-570. (In the case of the later, it may only come from Charvels which would justify the exclusion.

		<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180831174908/http://audiozone.dk/index-filer/jackson-pro-professional.php">Audiozone.dk Jackson Professional page</a>. The downfall of this site is part of my motivation to get this webpage together. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180831145043/http://audiozone.dk/index-filer/charvel-japan-import-guitars.php">Charvel page here.</a> Here is great information. Tremolo page <a href="http://audiozone.dk/index-filer/TremoloInfoProject.htm">here</a>.</p>
		
		
		<p><a href="http://charvelusa.com/models.html">ImportCharvel.com</a>. This is good because you can see the differnces between the years of the 80s import Charvels. I also like plentiful images and how it goes into the tricky Japanese domestic models. Be sure to click around. Though watermarked there are some great looking catalog scans here.</p>
		
		
		<p><a href="https://jacksoncharvel.fandom.com/wiki/Jackson_pickups">Jackson Charvel Wiki</a>. Here I link the pickups page because it's some what interesting. Overall not a fan of this place because there's hardly any articles and they're hard to find at that. Scattered and unfocused overall but feel free to dig around.</p>
		
		
		<p><a href="http://www.usacharvels.com/index.htm">Usacharvels.com</a>. Exactly what it sounds like with cool pictures. You can click and get stories about the guitar, since we're talking custom shop stuff here. My only issues is that it is zombie. The forums are dead and lots of the external links are long gone. Enjoy while it lasts.</p>
		
		<p><a href="https://www.jcfonline.com/">Jcfonline.com</a>.This is the only and I mean ONLY somewhat alive location dedicated to these guitars. Fortunately this is a forum. Unfortunately this is also a forum. Images are often broken due to file hosting issues. There's a wealth of info but buried deep. There are a mix of old timer contributors and hit and run 'ask a question in a topic and never return' members. That's not bad, but it does mean that threads will stagnate quit. Still, it's about the best we got at the moment!</p>
