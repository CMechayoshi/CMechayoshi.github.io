	<h1>The Charvel and Jackson Page (Under Construction)</h1>

		<p>Intro: <em>*UPDATE. I've removed the style tag for this page so the information is readable. It won't be ugly forever.</em> I'm a huge fan of these guitars. This will be a database of all good sources of info along with my personal collections and discoveries.</p>
		
		<h3>Personal Collection</h3>

		<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13JTcEG8dZJlPDRJrV9yhnYzPxdy_mZpP?usp=sharing">My personal album.</a> Please note that most of these images weren't meant to document anything initially, just images I took at the time so excuse poor camera work. Guitars seen are Charvette 400 bass, Charvel Model 1B, Charvel Model 2B, Jackson Concert Bass EX, Charvel Model 4B, Jackson RR3, Dinky Std, a hard to find these days Jackson guitar soft case, and lastly my Charvel Fusion Custom. See the album for individual comments.</p>

	<p><b>Soloist:</b> Jackson’s signature model, these are always neckthru style super-strats. The first was completed August 28, 1984 however San Dimas examples were made to order with no set rules. Eventually early distinctions were between the Soloist Custom: neck-thru, 24 frets, ebony, bound fretboard, and ‘sharkfins’ or pearl dots and Soloists Student: the same but rosewood, no binding, and pearl dots only. Both of course were of equal quality. Floyd Rose, Kahler, and string through body were some options and Seymour Duncan’s were stock until 1985 when Jackson started to use in-house wound pickups. The finishes were pretty much whatever. Ontario era brings some changes such as the JT-6 bridge and an archtop option. In 1990 Soloists became a regular production model which we can conveniently break down below.(Sources used:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Soloist)">(wiki)</a></p>
	
	
		<ul>
			<li><b>Jackson Soloist SL1 :</b> This is a USA flagship Soloist. Features 24 frets, sharks, an OFR, an ebony bound board, maple neck, HSS pickup config, and Seymour Duncan (TB-4 and STK-S1). Introduced in 1996- 98 is Poplar, a wood a lot of old Charvel/Jackson stuff would be if not Basswood, but since 1999 they are Alder. This is a current model but they now call it ‘USA Select Soloist SL1’ so don’t get confused. The Finishes vary. 
			
			<li><b>Jackson Soloist SL2 (USA):</b> This is a USA Soloist with two humbuckers (Jackson JP-10, JP-11), ebony found board with either sharks or no markers, a JT-580 LP bridge, and a three way toggle. Finishes were BLK(Black), GMG(Gun Metal Gray), BGP(Blue Green Pearl), YGP(Yellow/Gold Pearl), DCR(Deep Candy Red). The wood is poplar.
			
			<li><b>SL2:</b> What, again? Jackson later made this an import ‘Pro Series’ and gave it piranha inlays, direct mount pickups, and with Duncan Distortion Mayhem Humbuckers. Yes this is a ‘switcheroo’ model where the various iterations are really different guitars. Now the body wood is mahogany. Colors are black, caramel burl (SL2P), deep purple metallic, and more, some with matching headstocks. The Floyd is a FRT-O5000 or 1000.
			
			<li><b>Jackson Soloist SL2H:</b> Again again? This is another guitar, yes. You have 24 frets, sharkfins MOP, ebony board, mahogany wings, a OFR, and Seymour Duncan. There are lots of finish options.

			<li><b>Jackson Soloist SL3:</b> ‘Pro Series’ so MIJ import then later Indonesia. 24 frets, rosewood with sharkfins, with an alder body, HSS set up with hotrail Duncans and a bridge JB. The fretboard is rosewood and the tremolo a JT-580. The Indonesian ones have piranha inlays, ebony fretboard, mahogany body, and the Floyd Rose 1000 with the Seymour Duncan’s being changed to TB-6 and SSL-6.

		<p><a href="https://guitarinside.com/Jackson_models">Guitarinside.com</a> So here were get some pretty extensive information on most but not all Jackson models, US and import. Because I can't get in contact with the owner, I may be duplicating and completing some missing info on my own as a junior collector. I am tracking some MISSING information below. Remember that this is not to criticize the site but for my personal reference:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Fails to list Jackson Dinky HX. A prototype of only 100. Source: 
			<a href="https://www.jcfonline.com/forum/equipment/import-jackson-guitars/33217-info-on-a-dinky-hx">(1)</a>
			<a href="https://www.jcfonline.com/forum/equipment/import-jackson-guitars/84789-how-much-is-my-dinky-hx-worth">(2)</a>
			<a href="https://www.jcfonline.com/forum/equipment/import-jackson-guitars/153256-ngd-jackson-professional-stealth-hx-japan">(3)</a>
			<a href="https://www.jcfonline.com/forum/equipment/import-jackson-guitars/85944-stealth-hx">(4)</a>
			
			<li>Fails to list Jackson DK2, DK2L, DK2M, DK2A, DK2T, DK2FF, DK3 and some related variants, mid range versions of the DK1 Dinky. Typically Made in Japan, but not always. The Wikipedia link is good, better than you'd think, but not perfect as it lists the Dinky DR3 with the DK series. If you are unaware, the DR3 was the last iteration of the Jackson Professional Dinky Reverse line up, so it belongs with the older Professional MIJ Jacksons, not the newer "Pro Series" Jacksons from the 2000s. (Note that the later "Pro" Jacksons are typically MIJ too, but not all of these are, necessitating the distinction.
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Dinky">Wiki link</a>
			
			<li>Fails to mention that later Jackson Concert EX bases have the lighter JB-340 bridge and ealier ones the heavy JB-440 bridge. (Stamped Jackson)
			
			<li>Does not mention the JT-6, common on older import Charvels but also some USA Jackson or the single locking Schaller JT-570. (In the case of the later, it may only come from Charvels which would justify the exclusion.

		<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180831174908/http://audiozone.dk/index-filer/jackson-pro-professional.php">Audiozone.dk Jackson Professional page</a>. The downfall of this site is part of my motivation to get this webpage together. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180831145043/http://audiozone.dk/index-filer/charvel-japan-import-guitars.php">Charvel page here.</a> Here is great information. Tremolo page <a href="http://audiozone.dk/index-filer/TremoloInfoProject.htm">here</a>.</p>
		
		
		<p><a href="http://charvelusa.com/models.html">ImportCharvel.com</a>. This is good because you can see the differnces between the years of the 80s import Charvels. I also like plentiful images and how it goes into the tricky Japanese domestic models. Be sure to click around. Though watermarked there are some great looking catalog scans here.</p>
		
		
		<p><a href="https://jacksoncharvel.fandom.com/wiki/Jackson_pickups">Jackson Charvel Wiki</a>. Here I link the pickups page because it's some what interesting. Overall not a fan of this place because there's hardly any articles and they're hard to find at that. Scattered and unfocused overall but feel free to dig around.</p>
		
		
		<p><a href="http://www.usacharvels.com/index.htm">Usacharvels.com</a>. Exactly what it sounds like with cool pictures. You can click and get stories about the guitar, since we're talking custom shop stuff here. My only issues is that it is zombie. The forums are dead and lots of the external links are long gone. Enjoy while it lasts.</p>
		
		<p><a href="https://www.jcfonline.com/">Jcfonline.com</a>.This is the only and I mean ONLY somewhat alive location dedicated to these guitars. Fortunately this is a forum. Unfortunately this is also a forum. Images are often broken due to file hosting issues. There's a wealth of info but buried deep. There are a mix of old timer contributors and hit and run 'ask a question in a topic and never return' members. That's not bad, but it does mean that threads will stagnate quit. Still, it's about the best we got at the moment!</p>
