<h3>Jackson Soloist: Jackson’s other signature model (see Rhoads entry), these are neck-thru superstrats. The first was completed August 28, 1984. Early distinctions were between the Soloist Custom: neck-thru, 24 frets, ebony, bound fretboard, and ‘sharkfins’ or pearl dots and Soloists Student: the same but rosewood, no binding, and pearl dots only. Both of course were of equal quality. Floyd Rose, Kahler, and string through body were some options and Seymour Duncan’s were stock until 1985 when Jackson started to use in-house wound pickups. The finishes were pretty much whatever. Ontario era brings some changes such as the JT-6 bridge and an archtop option. In 1990 Soloists became a regular production model. An asterisk means that the model or specs of such are dubious and clarification or further research is needed.</h3>

Finishes: pearl white, metallic black, deep metallic blue, bright red
			
			<li><b>Jackson Soloist ATT Pro:</b> An archtop ‘Professional’ guitar with the tremolo option. Noteworthy is the 24.75 scale, though you’d never know it from the title.

			<li><b>Jackson Soloist Std professional:</b> Is that other stuff above too fancy? This ‘Professional’ Soloist has you covered. Poplar body, Takeuchi JT-580 LP tremolo, rosewood board with pearl dots, Jackson J-92C and J-100Vs pickups. One volume tone and three-way. This is the same specs and quality as the above, save perhaps for the tremolo. Take advantage of that to score deals. 1993-95.
		</ul>

<h3>Jackson Rhoads: The famous guitar ‘Jackson’ was made for essentially, a collaboration between Randy Rhoads and Grover Jackson.

<h3>Jackson King V: This is an aggressively styled guitar named after ‘King’ Robbin Crosby of Ratt. The V-shaped design spawned from a custom Jackson he’d play, a ‘Double Rhoads’ (a V guitar comprised of the ‘long’ wings of a Rhoads. This was never a regular production model). Later Dave Mustaine would be the face of this guitar among others. The King V was designed as a smaller version of the Double Rhoads to accompany more average sized players. These guitars are traditionally two humbucker designs with a tremolo, but not always. Other design specs vary as well, such as 24 or 22 frets, knob/control configurations, the fretboard, etc.</h3>

<h3>Jackson Warrior: An X shaped guitar with each point resembling a Jackson headstock. Introduced late 1989 and designed by Mikey Wright, a Jackson R&D, the shape was discontinued (and apparently unpopular) a year later after the USA and Pro models. In 2001 however, it was reissued and continued to be a brutal design earning its namesake. Usual specs include 24 frets, fast Jackson neck, a tremolo, and two humbucking pickups. Unique to the initial models, the USA and Pro are the 24.75 scale and have three slanted in reverse rail pickups. See Links section for more history.</h3>

<h3>Jackson Concert Bass: A four string bass Jackson offered at least as early as 1984. The classic Concert Bass is a four string 34  inch scale neck-thru or bolt-on bass with 21 frets using a p-bass (J-20) neck pickup and a jazz single coil (J-150) or humbucking (varied) bridge pickup along with the J-2000 Bass preamp later. It has the ‘custom’ and ‘student’ options as did many classic custom shop Jacksons. During the 90s the Concert bass had three ‘Professional’ series variants and a ‘Performer’. In 1998 the line was drastically redesigned into several four and five string variants, passive and active. In 2002 it received another redesign as the CMG Concert bass and finally in 2012 using a similar look to the previous the current JS and X Series Concert basses.</h3>

<a id="Grover90s">
<h3>Later 90s Jackson Stars and GJ*: A similar story to the Grover Jacksons, these are usually Japanese made import Jacksons but for the domestic market there only. They consist of the typical classic Jackson shapes and styles, similar to worldwide market models but may also consist of unique models. Some are Jackson Stars custom shop instruments, USA made but sold only to Japanese markets, thus the Jackson Stars logo. GJ or Team GJ is for Grover Jackson. This is like the stars but later down the line. (A bit more research needed. Also some color codes needed)
</h3>

<h3>Signature Jackson Stars: All with hardcases. 1996-9?</h3>

	</ul>

<h3>Jackson Stars USA: 1996-99(?) USA Jackson but sold under Jackson Stars. Being such they also have US graphic options for finishes: Lightning sky, black and white dragon, errie dess, snakeskin, skulls, flames, sunset, standing woman, multi colored dragon, speres, coral sea, turquoise stone. Of note is that although these are from mid to late 90s they feature ‘old school’ USA specs for Jacksons, such as poplar bodies over alder, Schaller tremolos over Original Floyd Roses, and a few downgrades at least ostensibly, like rosewood fretboards over ebony. To make up for that however, we can see a few guitar designs here that would later be implemented in the worldwide market versions, particularly with the Soloists and Dinkys below. All came with hardcases.</h3>
