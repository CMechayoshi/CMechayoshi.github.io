<p>This will be an article on what I feel makes a Nintendo Adventure Book great. If you are unfamiliar they are a 1991-92 ‘Choose-your-own-adventure’ series based on Nintendo characters, mostly Mario but sometimes The Legend of Zelda. As you will note on <a href="NintendoAdventureBooks.html">my walk through page</a> for series the quality varies and it’s quite interesting why. There are only two writers under pen names yet the writing can be night and day from book to book. I will focus primarily on the Mario themed books I’ve read. Let’s break it down.</p>

<p><b>Plots:</b> A good book in this series should have a plot that’s engaging and different than an experience someone would get from the main canon games. Surprisingly all of the books are at minimum mildly interesting in their premise. We have colorful plot lines such as Bowser creating clones of everyone, the Mushroom King being transformed into a rabbit unless Mario and co can win a whistle in Olympic like games, various Bowser baddies being merged into freakazoid monsters, Mario and Luigi being sucked into dimensional portals based on retro games, tennis shoes with a mind of their own that whisk Princess Peach away for a forced ballet tour, people’s minds and bodies swapping in all the Kingdom, and needed to explore Yoshi’s...gut. Other books have a slightly more normal for Mario plot, such as a bad guy putting Mario’s friends in danger or someone going missing. This alone is not indicative of the writing quality, but it is nice that none of them copy and paste scenarios taking from the games.</p>

<p><b>Characters:</b> The best protagonist I have read are usually Mario and Luigi as a team. For obvious reasons this paring allows the best dialog, banter, and other action on the adventure. Mario or Luigi plus an other secondary character varies.  I’ve seen this work okay with Toad for instance but not so much with Yoshi who cannot speak in these books. The worst is usually Mario or Luigi solo. Without banter the writer then has to find other ways to make the scenery or scenarios interesting and that doesn’t always turn out so great. Bowser or someone related is almost always the bad guy though there are neat exceptions. Their villainous plans are usually executed well enough even if it is inexplicable how they come up with the wacky ideas.</p>

<p><b>Scenery:</b> Stories take place either in the Mushroom Kingdom or Dinosaur Land. It all depends on how the writer handles it. At worst the book can make chapters sound like a bland advertisement or shout out. I do lean slightly to the older books in the Mushroom Kingdom. Something about it feels more timeless and there are the eight worlds of Super Mario Bros 3 for much more variety verses the tropics and dinosaurs of Dinosaur Land.  </p>

<p><b>Structure:</b> You may find this make or break for your overall enjoyment. Most books branch quite a bit at the start. There is an intro chapter to ease you in and then a puzzle that will either give a hint or give the first branching points. The middle of all of the books will allow for some exploration but it must feel like it has ‘purpose’. Mario or Luigi randomly stumbling around in the book is not very fun and does not give the reader a sense of where they are in the story. The book should guide you towards a goal but allow multiple ways to do it. On different read-through you should ideally be able to encounter different things and still be able to reach the end. Those are my expectations. Some books reach this and others don’t. For instance Book 3: Monster Mix-Up struck me as being aimless and difficult to navigate even as a child due to the scenery being generic and identical and chapters needlessly looping you. Sometimes the tendency to loop is part of the design. Book 6: Doors to Doom will require the reader to reread pages to complete the story. (YMMV on if this is an outright flaw or just bad design.)</p>

<p>Let me briefly elaborate on whether or not is is appropriate to revisit pages and count their points: Some readers of this series question if this is okay and if you are to recount any points awarded in this manner. The answer is yes unless the book says otherwise. The book should be written in a way so that this isn’t too annoying or awkward. Does this make the score infinite then? Unfortunately yes. Pages that give awards “should” not be on any loopback but the reality is that the writers don’t think that far ahead. (See score section)</p>

<p>What about the finale? Many books become linear at the end and how well this will come off will depend on the quality of the book until then. If the book was strong this doesn’t ruin it, but if the book was mediocre this is just the final straw. There are however standout counterexamples that give the reader options down to the end nearly (Book 2: Leaping Lizards, Book 5: Pipe Down!, Book 12: Brain Drain). The pinnacle of this sort of thing is if the book allows the reader some room for error during the finale. For example if the reader did not do perfect on earlier sections but can scrape away a victory at the expense for not obtaining the high score (see Score section). This is rare in this series yet Leaping Lizards and Pipe Down! for instance pull this off.</p>

<p><b>Puzzles:</b> On my walk through page I compartmentalize the puzzles present in this series into seven main categories. Ideally the books should offer some variety but really whatever they throw at you just needs to be fair and easily understood yet not too mindless to complete. Puzzles are supposed to help you in some way, whether allowing you to know what’s the better path to take or giving you something of value like points or items. Unfortunately even in the otherwise better written stories, you will find puzzles that don’t give a definitive answer on what to do or just plain don’t offer anything. Puzzles that relate to the theme of the book at least are great. I often penalize puzzles if I feel they expect too much work, often exacerbated by unclear and/or overly long instructions, because this tempts the reader to simply not bother. If a badly done puzzle is directly tied in to an item that’s needed for victory, that’s an even more serious issue. Some puzzles have various scoring based on how well you do. This can be amusing because a really high or low score may be presented as a page split option that is actually a red herring, leading to a ‘You can’t get this score!’ page. The assumption here is that they think you cheated or can’t count. Sometimes a higher score is legit and you will wonder how you can actually obtain such a score. I don’t consider than an error but it can be frustrating. </p>

<p><b>Items:</b> What role these play depend entirely on the book. Some books are very item focused, requiring one or more for competition. At worse a book will have the item buried on a page a that’s hard to navigate to (ie: there is only one path to it and no handy loopbacks) with little to no hints it is needed until it is too late. Other books feature items where necessity depends on your choices. I think a medium between the two is best. I think some sort of item(s) should be needed to encourage exploration in the book, but it should be hinted at and not hard to find and if you miss it there should be at least one opportunity to obtain it without a total reset. Some books have hazards which will remove or ‘buffet’ as I put it in my guides, the player of their item. This can be very bad and the end of you so I consider this a huge annoyance and an unfair portion of the books when they feature it. </p>

<p>Another unwelcome quirk is ‘Items of Doom’ that will kill you later down the road. They always feel out of left field and a cheap way to lose. I have one exception where I am okay with this however. In Leaping Lizards there is a normal item of doom, the anchor but only on certain pages. So it gets only  half of my usual ire there, but more interesting is that there are two more items of doom but only if optionally combined during the finale. The pogo stick and wings will be the end of your character but the book presents it in such a funny way it actually makes sense.</p>

<p><b>Scoring:</b> We can be quick here. Some books award coins that convert to points and other books simply award the points. You are given certain rankings on how well you do but it seems they came up with them before the book was completed. In some books you will obtain the max score by winning whereas in other books it may seem nigh impossible to get the highest score no matter what. I suppose if you tally your score on failed game over trips in the book those lower scores will come up, but going for full completion you will find the score system just useless. </p>

<p><b>Illustrations:</b> Art in the books are usually taken from official game artwork but often there custom edits or completely original characters and settings. Aside from the fact that the incorrect character may be shown, I rate this satisfactory overall.</p>
