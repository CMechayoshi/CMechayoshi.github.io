<H1>The Perfect Nintendo Adventure Book</h1>

	<img src="images/IMG_20190810_091152.jpg" alt="Old Nintendo Adventure Books collection" style="width:500px;height:400px;">

<p>This article is a general overview of the Mario themed Nintendo Adventure Books, a more opinion based companion of my guide page. These books are a 1991-92 ‘Choose-your-own-adventure’ series based on mostly the Valiant Nintendo Comics System. The characters are from the world of Mario except for two books based on The Legend of Zelda. As you will note on <a href="NintendoAdventureBooks.html">my walk through page</a> for series, the quality varies drastically at times despite there being only two writers under pen names. Here we will focus primarily on the Mario themed books I’ve read. Let’s break it down.</p>

		<img src="PaperImages/MariovBowser.PNG" alt="Mario vs Bowser" align="left">
		<p style="text-align:center"><em>The tale as old as time, when Bowser created mutants out of his own minions and was defeated by a two headed giant Mario brother hybrid. What? Don't remember that?</em></p>

<p><b>Plots:</b> This part is easy at least it seems. Give us an interactive adventure in Mario's world. Astoundingly all of the books are at minimum mildly interesting in their premise. Bowser creates clones of everyone, the Mushroom King is transformed into a rabbit until Mario and co can win a whistle in Olympic like games, various Bowser baddies are merged into freaky monsters, Mario and Luigi are sucked into dimensional portals based on retro games, tennis shoes with a mind of their own  whisk Princess Peach away for a forced ballet tour, people’s minds and bodies are swapped at random in all the Kingdom, and once they'll need to explore Yoshi’s insides. Other books have a slightly more typical deal such as a bad guy putting Mario’s friends in danger or someone going missing. Really I have little issue here.</p>

<p><b>Characters:</b> The best protagonist(s) is usually Mario and Luigi as a team as this paring allows for the best dialog, banter, and other action on the adventure. Mario or Luigi plus an other secondary character varies. It can work okay with Toad for instance but not so much with Yoshi who cannot speak in these books. The least exciting is usually Mario or Luigi solo. Without banter the writer has to struggle to find other ways to make the scenery or scenarios interesting. Bowser or someone related is almost always the bad guy though there are neat exceptions. Their evil plans are usually executed well enough as evidenced by the many ways the protagonist can game over and thus allow them to win. Often it's inexplicable how they come up with the wacky ideas, but that adds to the charm. Side characters are presented decently enough, often the way they might in comics of this time period. They sometimes have unique names and appearances, and for one-offs like Dr. Shrinkasaurus they seem to go all out!</p>

<p><b>Scenery:</b> Stories take place either near the Mushroom Kingdom or Dinosaur Land. It all depends on how the writer handles it because they are free to either utilize cannon locations or make some up. At worst the book can make chapters sound like a bland showcase for either Super Mario Bros 3 or Super Mario World. In other words they stick to the dry basics and describe genericly the typical Mario geometries. At best however both environments can be used creatively to give the reader choices to make and dangers to avoid. </p>

<p><b>Structure:</b> This is my primary factor for overall enjoyment. The intro chapter eases the reader in and then features a puzzle that will either give a hint or present the first branching points. There are two methods they seem to use the most. The first is where the protagonist has a huge vast area to explore and you can do so somewhat freely. You must be careful because you will may know exactly what you need to explore or do before you reach the end, which will contrastingly be linear. The second method is to have a somewhat structured journey. There are still branches but they are more or less detours to the same places. Here however I notice that the ending may allow more room to do different things.</p>

<p>So what do I prefer? I can't be too harsh here because these books by design only have one 'Good' and several 'Bad' endings. It's not like other choose-your-own-adventure books where you will get endings in between. Regardless I have quite a bit to say. The book should give the reader a sense of progression either way first of all. On different read-throughs you should be able to encounter different things and still be able to reach the end. Understandably there will be paths that lead no where or to death and hazards but I still  expect the book to make exploring these interesting. With that in mind I think I would take the second option if only due to the unintended consequence that the writing seems to suffer the more open they try to get. I'd also rather they pull the best tricks for the end rather than be let down by an ending sequence that will drag and be the same exact thing every single time. </p>

<p>Let's briefly single some offenders out: Book 3: Monster Mix-Up is the first type. It struck me as being aimless and difficult to navigate as a child due to the scenery being generic and identical and the structure having a bad habit of needlessly looping you. It was in fact a large part of the reason why I wanted to create a guide series. Book 2: Leaping Lizards is type two. It guides you on a set journey with a little bit of optional scenery on alternate reads, but it has an ending with <em>many</em> different events to discover. Book 6: Doors to Doom is I feel a hybrid. Like type one you will need to loop and it has a linear end, but like type two the journey is somewhat structured to encounter specific events.</p>

<p>Let me touch the elephant in the room with these books, at least as far as the scoring is concerned. Is it appropriate or not to revisit pages and recount their points as some readers question? Personally I do unless the book says otherwise. The book should be written in a way so that this doesn't cause issues. Does this make the score infinite then? Unfortunately yes. Pages that give awards “should” not be on any loopback, but the reality is that the writers don’t think that far ahead. (See Score section)</p>

<p>What about the finale? No book will do anything too wild at the end but as touched on before some will have a stringent single winning path (Book 3: Monster Mix-up, Book 4: Koopa Kapers, Book 7: Dinosaur Dilemma) or instead give you some choices to explore down to the end or very close. (Book 2: Leaping Lizards, Book 5: Pipe Down!, Book 12: Brain Drain). I think the best is when the book is designed thoughtfully enough to allow the reader some room for error during the finale. You may not do perfect on earlier sections but can scrape away a victory at the expense of not obtaining the high score (see Score section). This is rare in this series but 'Leaping Lizards' and 'Pipe Down!' for instance pull this off. </p>

<p><b>Puzzles:</b> On my walk through page I compartmentalize the puzzles present in this series into seven main categories. Ideally the books should offer some variety but really whatever they do, just make it a mild challenge yet fair. I find personally that the puzzle's relation to Mario game mechanics and/or the book's theme or not don't correlate to quality. I mean it's cute when they do tie it all in, but you will find some puzzles head scratchers and not in the way they intend. Generally puzzles are supposed to help you in some way, typically allowing you to know what’s the better path to take or giving you something of value like points or items, but other times they are arbitrarily there. I call this 'Just a Hint' type puzzles.</p>

<p>Unfortunately even in the otherwise better written stories you might find puzzles that think they are helping you but don’t give a definitive answer on what to do. I often penalize them as well if I feel they expect too much work, often exacerbated by unclear and/or overly long instructions. This discourages you to try and instead to guess, missing the point as the 'games' you play to help Mario or Luigi are an integral part of the series- at least to me. If a badly done puzzle is directly tied in to an item that’s needed for victory, that’s an even more serious issue. Some puzzles have variable scoring based on how well you do or what random path you take. This can be amusing when a really high or low score is presented as a page split option that is actually a red herring, leading to a ‘You can’t get this score!’ page. The assumption here is that they think you cheated or can’t count. On occasion a useful path is 'paywalled' by a score you need to obtain that's difficult to get. I don’t consider that necessarily an error but it can be frustrating and in general I think those puzzles should only be for score and not for important paths.</p>

		<p style="text-align:center"><em>Be careful how you solve puzzles like this, as it may affect if the high score or the path you need is obtainable or not. (Source:Mariowiki)</em></p>

<p><b>Items:</b> Mario uses power ups so of course they're here too, required for these book's 'item checks'. Some books are very item focused, requiring you to find one or more for competition. Others have the items on a path you can't easily avoid so it's a moot point and/or it's more for avoiding hazards than life or death. Neither is inherently bad but they way they handle it can be frustrating if the item is buried on a page a that is hard to navigate to (few paths to it) or there is no hints it is needed until it is too late. An alarming amount of books, even otherwise good ones, don't really warn about this thing so be careful. I do think some sort of item(s) should be needed to encourage exploration and emulate a game like experience, but it should be hinted at or at the very least if you miss the item check there should be at least one opportunity to obtain it without a total reset. Some books have hazards which will remove or ‘buffet’ as  the player of their item. This can be detrimental if you cannot obtain it again and often leads to more penalties or a game over later down the road, though some books thankfully allow the reader to navigate back to it.</p>

<p>Another related quirk are ‘Items of Doom’ that will end the game by the reader utilizing it or even more egregiously by simply having it in their inventory. These are oft out of left field give give you a cheap feeling. I have one exception where it's kind of funny. Without spoilers (just see the guide for it) In 'Leaping Lizards' there are two items of this nature but only if optionally combined during the finale. You'll still regret it but you might laugh too!</p>

		<img src="PaperImages/Nintendo_Adventure_Book_Score_Card.jpg" alt="Brain Drain score card" align="right">
		<p style="text-align:center"><em>A typical score card to the right, in this instance one that requires the reader to convert their coins to points.</em></p>

<p><b>Scoring:</b> We can be quick here. Some books award points or coins that later convert to points so that's ..point-less. You are given certain rankings on how well you do on the back page. It seems they came up with the ranking thresholds before some books were completed. Yet another alarming quirk in many books is that you will obtain the maximum score by simply reaching the end, or there is an opposite issue in that it feels nigh impossible to get the highest score no matter what- or at least not 'naturally'. This brings us to the 'should you reread pages and farm points' issue mentioned above. You can never be sure if they really intend that or not. We're not done here. Most of the lower scores can be hard to reach as well in an little twist. I suppose if you tally your score on bad ending those lower scores will come up, but who is really going to focus on that? This isn't an arcade game with no ending, there is a set start and end point. I feel most would focus on their score after they 'beat' the book. So the lowest scores are arbitrary is what I'm rambling about.. It might be an interesting self imposed challenge to see what's the <em>lowest</em> you can complete the adventure with. </p>

		<p style="text-align:center"><em>The quality of some of the 'original' artwork you can find in the series. (Source:Mariowiki)</em></p>

<p><b>Illustrations:</b> Expect lots of stock art of Mario and crew, usually taken from official game artwork. There are frequently enough custom edits and completely original characters and settings. Aside from the fact that the incorrect character may be shown compared to what the page's text describes, I rate this satisfactory overall. Some are more basic than others but they have personality.</p>


<p><b>Concluding thoughts:</b> I.. still... love this collection. There is nothing like it in the Mario series really. I am sure some seasoned choose-your-own-adventure fans might scoff at a few things here or find it a little to 'light' or basic but any Mario fan who is even vaguely interested should check out as many as you can. Each adventure, good or bad, offers something unique and worth checking out. For more of my thoughts on them individually, just see my guides. Thanks for reading!</p>
