was in the black heart of the eighth known mushroom world, tackling
the last gauntlet between him and the princess in the clutches of the
wicked 'Bowser Koopa'. Whipped thoroughly into shape by perils
endured and challenges never imagined, he was the first person brave-
or stupid enough to cross the drawbridge over lava. It rocked and
creaked with every step but Bowser was at the other end and there was
no turning back. A fireball rolled down the narrow path. Mario jumped
over it just as hammers of dull steel rained down and pelted the
fragile walkway. Bowser launched himself into the air before Mario
could slam the axe he acquired into The Enemy's forehead. Mario slid
out of the way instead and when Bowser landed the bridge buckled in
the middle and Mario stumbled backwards. The Enemy&hellip;could not
win now! This gave Mario a new less violent but more interesting
idea. Just a moment later, when he struck the bridge with the axe and
the whole thing went down, the look on Bowser's face was priceless-</span></span></span></font></font></font></span></em></p>

brothers stopped at the apex of a five story tall sand dune, others
ahead resembling pale blue glaciers in the moonlight. Everything was
quiet as it had been since they stealthily set out on the adventure.
They had spotted what were ostensibly other travelers a considerable
distance away but never close enough to see a face or discern a
species. There were no signs or land marks. The only thing certain
were fresh foot prints down hill- Their own, wrapping around to
complete the circle they'd went in.</font></font></font></p>

mp3 he'd forgotten he'd downloaded, he made another far scan of their

that Boo actually harnessed those skills to impress Luigi one day.
Boo had polished and retouched all of Jr. Troopa's collectables and
found a plank of wood to plug up the Mecha-Yoshi blast sight under
Ludwig's supervision. That favor for someone legitimately unable to
do so on their own Boo didn't mind, at least enough to not complain
audibly. Irritation however festered when Ludwig began to think of
other chores: Going out to find some paper to write on, then again to
get pen, then again because that pen was out of ink, then again
because he wanted to write in black and not blue. Trying to find him
a musical instrument to practice on: then complaining because the
folk instrument Boo found was tuned into G instead of C, again
because the C tuned instrument had a broken string, then again
because he became bored of that one. Fetching a warm blanket: A
warmer one. But not that warm! Finding some more pants: another pair
because the size is wrong, another pair because the color was drab,
another pair because it would be nice to have a spare. Then Ludwig
decided a hot shower would be nice-</font></font></font></p>

cozy recliner- perhaps the one thousandth La-Z-boy down South lying
around- was just perfect for the moment. The wall was lined with
switches and blinking lights, also a sophisticated camera system
displaying rooms of that building and a few other places around the
South, the pub, a farm, a storehouse, and a random hottub, all
vacated but equally suggesting things Ludwig didn't care to know. The
VHS tapes lying around were labeled, 'Vick' so that narrowed it down.

regarding Daisy. Something about requesting her health records.
Plainly was the code to contact them on a kingdom to kingdom

climbed out of the weapons bunker and into the open, leaving the

Daisy, not Jr. Koopa, not Jelectro, not Kylie and especially not
