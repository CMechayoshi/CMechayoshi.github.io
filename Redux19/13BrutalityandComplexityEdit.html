<font color="#000000"><font face="Verdana"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt"><span style="background: transparent">Ludwig
felt rejuvenated for the first time in the last twenty-four hours.
Spending the afternoon in stiff economic class benches did nothing to
take away from it. He was not one to penny pinch on the regular or
ever if given the option, but he had little recourse when he'd left
his wallet and the credit cards inside in the ruins of Bowser's
Castle. He wondered if in Sky Land his father had taken over and
claimed the kingdom's castle nestled gently in the cloudy aerial
landscape by now. Wonder grew into worry and worry towered and became
fear and then fear toppled over into crushing dread... With that he'd
successfully drained away all of the tranquility he'd built up over
the train ride. Ludwig knew he was adept at sabotaging himself out of
happiness but he was really out doing it this time.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.13in; margin-bottom: 0.13in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 138%; text-decoration: none">
<font color="#000000"><font face="Verdana"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt"><span style="background: transparent">Ludwig
rose his head from the travel pillow as a yawn escaped him. Get a
grip, the general reminded himself. He was traveling to Poshley
Heights to meet the revered 'Villain Council' by way of the Excess
Express. Now get excited already! -The way his brother Lemmy, his
secretary, might chime over his shoulder in his uniquely half
irritating half adorable way. He took an sip from his sparkling
beverage in the cup holder. They were reaching more upper scale
territory he noted. The ride was getting smoother. Indeed he had
reason to be ecstatic. This honor that would have obviously been his
years ago if 'Super Mario Maker' had not ruined his life that fateful
day. Curses to Mario and that 'undo' button shattering the dreams of
his perfect castle level... Soon Ludwig spotted out the window a
marble water fountain embedded among rows of neatly trimmed green
grass and vibrant genetically altered purple fire flowers. He was at
his destination and he couldn't wait to shed the Phantom of the Opera
like disguise he'd used to keep out of the public eye. At least it
worked well, repelling other passengers and causing the attendant to
stare at him strangely.</span></font></font></font></p>

they weren't so judgmental, instead perplexed at last passenger
exiting the locomotive with their arms full. Ludwig was trying to be
generous for the family with the bags of goods, so stuffed it towered
above his tied back blue hair. Swaying back and forth and vision
hindered by the mask on his face, his foot caught a high spot on the
brick road and he dropped and busted what would have been Wendy's
sparkling water. Ludwig caught his reflection in the sizzling mess
and scowled, feeling absurd. That was why he did not 'do' generous.
Disguise free, the remainder of the time before his special
appointment he spent on himself. He explored beautiful multistory
Victorian buildings, the stores, the inns, the clubs. Oddly he never
spot buses or taxis. Some posh walker would spot a koopaling in their
midst occasionally but the zapper he carried with him would seal
their lips in a hurry. He discovered a humble library tucked away
from the touristy areas. His attention was caught by the 'EX' on a
book jutting out a corner shelf but it was no 'Ex spatio obiecti
specialem'. It was a cheesy book on exes. He chuckled dryly and then
drifted into dejectedness. Nothing a jog couldn't fix.</span></font></font></font></p>

in overhead sun, Ludwig was starting to perspire as he crossed a
stone bridge leading to a granite polished city building. His moment
had arrived. He weaved between various flag poles erected. Some toad
officers allowed him into the empty halls of the building where each
step of his echoed.</span></font></font></font></p>

continued, leading Ludwig up some spiraling hardwood stairs. He
turned his head with a smirk. The koopaling tensed but his guide
moved the light conversation along, eventually escorting him to the
top floor where there was only one large imposing door ahead.
&quot;Usually those Marios would have made a move by now.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>

are likely occupied with the Mushroom Flu problem. All according to

that, so he entered on his own. The eerily featureless wood panel
room was medium sized with a high ceiling but no furniture. In the
middle stood the Villain Counsel, magikoopas in robes of red, blue,
green, and white. They spontaneously clapped when he entered.</span></font></font></font></p>

goatee approached with a box containing a gold badge with a detailed
engraving of a skull and crossbones, aventurine accents in the
backdrop and a ruby in the eyes of the skull. 'Mega in ultimum
exitium villian' was etched underneath. The thing Ludwig sought for
the last five years was now in his grasp.</span></font></font></font></p>

snout was carpet burned, royally so. The sting took away from the
throb radiating from the back of his head. He resisted glaring at the
guard that bludgeoned him after his opening statement of 'We have
your daughter so answer my questions right now' was.. the wrong one.
Ludwig rose to his knees and remained there to conceal anymore hint
of fiendishness in his demeanor.</span></font></font></font></p>

me try again. I am aware I am the son of your daughter's kidnapper
but I am not here to pester you. I only have a question.&quot; Ludwig
then bowed respectfully, wary of the spears aimed at his back by
guards. Everyone knew The Mushroom King lived out of town in Poshley
Heights, but no one including himself knew that the precise location
was not in a castle but a lavishly furnished albeit hidden inn. Very
curious. &quot;A certain person worked for Bowser Castle when I was
just a small child. Though few records show this, I can testify that
he worked closely with the philanthropist Dr. Mario to alleviate my
people from the first outbreak of Mushroom Flu. Eventually he went on
his way, but I recently found that he worked in your castle before
coming to us. Why did you fire Dr. Theodore V. Koopa?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>

moment he answered, &quot;Dr. Koopa was the best in his field, very
meticulous and quick. Well spoken. Learned.&quot; He paused with a
flicker of dread. &quot;But soon I could notice insidiousness
flashing in his keen gaze before his manner returned to the state of

talented individual who happened to be a koopa. He was even a

King. I shudder to conceal the defects in Dr. Prof. Koopa's
character, however I can't help but to also be very appalled that you
subtly attribute such atrocities to his koopa nature and not his
isolated wickedness. Think of life from an 'enemy species'
perspective. We were only allowed full integration in the Mushroom
Kingdom a few decades ago, and in some of the more remote Mushroom

emotion he was able to spout and before a powerful political rival at
that... So that nagging feeling was correct. Peach's family had
secrets. Normally he would think of devious ways that could be
leveraged in the future when he was back with the Koopa Troop, but

head was spinning still when he found the library again. He lunged in
for local newspaper up front and emitted a loud exclamation skimming
the topic of Sky Land being victim of that 'Bowser Bomb gone wrong'.
The editors noted that that explanation was starting to seem less
accurate when Isle Delfino reported the same unnatural sky phenomenon
and yet had no weapon sightings. This occurred all yesterday for a
greater shock to Ludwig. On autopilot he found a cab waiting the

blanket of dew covered the ground and insects buzzed. The air was
clear and new grass sprout under the ashes of Bowser's storehouse
fiasco from last night. Warm rays were broken up by the canopy while
Peach planted herself in the fragmented light. She had this solitude
because of an emergency family meeting being held off somewhere. At
this point, she dropped pretending to be imperturbable and she didn't
want Toadsworth to see her so unprincess like. She was longing for
Mario now. Despite her being the native and him the foreigner, it was
he that anchored her, so lost in her own world before. Furthermore
she was plain frustrated, witnessing Bowser's forces botch the
execution everything from the sleeping routines to the bathroom
situation made her want to scream. She would have if far enough away
from camp. She returned before that creepy Sentry #11 watchdog could
rat on her and sat at the camp fire indignantly. She almost
discreetly made a call to her father, no one seeming to realize she
clearly had a working cellphone with battery, to let him know she was

played around with the weighty Mega Villain badge in his paws during
the lengthy taxi ride. At first it began to pall him and now it in
fact spawned contempt. Everything leading to this moment now was of
questionable worth and finally Ludwig was brave enough to not force
himself out of that state of mind. A bump in the road made it fall
from his loose grip and bounce under the seat in front of him. He
shed his jacket so he could stretch and blindly reaching for it,
eluding the crumbs and dust caked down there, he brushed against
something black and spherical, a bob-omb. Reluctantly Ludwig ignored
the implications of his cabbie, a stubbly faced but mundane red boo
having that. The sooner they got to the Mushroom Kingdom the better.
Then he could stealthily use one of their warp pipes to get to Giant
Land and.. he wasn't sure.</span></font></font></font></p>

was running late. Kylie Koopa wore a trench in the ground pacing
under the local water tower. Sometimes she'd enter the spy car that
brought her in the rustic territory for some air conditioning. Mr.
Jelectro waiting in the drivers seat did not say a word to her. She
supposed the noki was indeed exiled to the couch last night. What a
bump on a log. By contrast she could nearly burst like a bulky
bob-omb from excitement. She dashed to meet her guest half way.</span></font></font></font></p>

great to see ya. When I first got in town why was there a mob of
folks carrying torches and pitchforks and scythes?! I know a lot of
the locals are farmers but.. So anyway we got Sarasaland on the line

possible explanation came to him quickly. He lost an old cell phone
of his years ago in enemy territory and some of its data got leaked,
including his address book. For a little while there was some mix up
because he had Bowser's number saved under his own name as a crazy
idea to keep his friends from knowing when he was calling his rival.
Well he shouldn't feel too bad. Bowser told him once he had Mario
saved under 'Buttercup' to throw off his family. Now that was a dumb
idea, and also a strange tangent just then...</span></font></font></font></p>
