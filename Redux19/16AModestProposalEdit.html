orbs hovered in the sky. Luigi rubbed his eyes and yawned- there were
street lamps strolling by. The cozy interior and smooth ride of the
station wagon finally lulled him somewhat, how he found a miracle
after all the events following Daisy's chat with the 'general'.
Everyone managed to track down Mario. The older brother paced in the
town square over and over, white smoke pillowing all the while from
the small fire at the rental homes and ranchers with buckets of water
frantically racing there. Yoshi had to shake him a million times to
get words out of him. Then Mario blurted out some seemingly random
orders for everyone to immediately take. All Luigi could do was
follow his and hope that extra Herb Tea he'd forced his brother to
drink would have him more like himself when he returned. After all,

exited. &quot;You're welcome to come in,&quot; he yelled back. At
least to get out the cold. He had asked him at the last minute to
take him here. Luigi then heard the car cut off as he went inside.
Immediately he tripped over a weight set left by Mario in the dark,
stumbled over a table that still had old pizza boxes on it, bumped
the dresser full of videogames, and backed into the light switch. It
cut on. He let out a deep breath as his gaze fell upon a picture
frame on the TV stand. The tattered photo was from one of their first
Mario Parties, whichever one had the giant birthday cake with a
piranha plant infestation. All the friends were there, him, his
brother, Toad, Yoshi, even some bad guys like Bowser. His smile
waned. It just wasn't fair to have old happy memories soured by the
recent stuff. In a rare moment between them, the princess expressed a
similar sentiment, unwilling however to fully elaborate. Peach
insisted the 'stars always guided and assisted' with such feelings.
Maybe it worked for her but he was on the fence about that.. The
floorboards squeaked as the toad stepped in. He shed the mopey
exterior just in time.</span></font></font></font></p>

was borrowing Buckenberry's phone. Luigi was paranoid about
emergencies and didn't want to be without one. Why was Mario
attempting to ask his number one fanboy all that? Where was he going?
Luigi growled audibly. He dropped his bundle of plumbing the
equipment at Captain Toad's water logged boots. &quot;I don't know

can fix this yourself?&quot; he begged. &quot;Just tighten the bolt

walked the obnoxiously loud Mach Bike from their garage onto the
street, wishing he still had Dr. Richard Sr.'s finely preserved war

Toad Town streets until they transitioned into South Toad Town
streets and finally dirt Southern Mushroom Kingdom trails.
Instinctively he had the feeling he should follow the roads leading
out of the Southern Mushroom Kingdom. He coasted down the narrow dirt
trail under the moonlight. It began to incline, the path running into
some of the Mt. Rugged area. Everything illuminated by the headlamp
was just rusty red- and then blue.</span></font></font></font></p>

shiny and hand painted die cast models hanging from Jr. Troopa's
office ceiling hung over a koopaling's head. Of special interest was
the Koopa Doomship, Sky Pop, Koopa Clown Car, and Odyssey peacefully
suspended in close proximity that would never occur with the real
versions. There were also myriads of marshal arts awards hung around
the work space, oh and a mecha! Last, was the writing desk with his
journals and a bulky old computer. With that, Ludwig had scanned the
entire room. He glanced back at the locked door. &quot;Curses!&quot;
he exclaimed for the tenth time. No need for spirits to sink, he
stood no chance in the earlier altercation anyway, not with that blue
toad obeying any and every word from that plumber. It began with that
'special object'. It was no dark star but it still held an unknown
influence, tapped into by an unauthorized user. Mario. The Lexicon
glaringly omitted what those effects could be, explaining somewhat

no, that was just him being selfish and careless. He dropped
Secretary Vick's hand written, impressively, manual to the

cowhide wrapped around his body and a brown ten gallon enveloping his

walkie talkie procured from Junior's room, someone tried to arson the
Southern rental condos, specifically the one Mario was staying in.
That logically meant a curtain backstabbing plumber wouldn't be there
anymore. The office was very close to the Southern Hospital, a skip

streets, purportedly relatives of those cured this night of Mushroom
Flu. It would sure be unfortunate to get recognized as the one who
infected them!</span></font></font></font></p>

large jagged lump of sand marred the smooth shore where the waves of
Water Land rolled onto the yellow sands of Desert Land. The tail end
of the mound wiggled, revealing long clawed toes. The opposite end
agitated until something resembling a head lifted up. A wave washed
away mud to reveal a large confused koopa. On his knees Bowser
coughed violently as tide reached his chin. He stood and took a few
wobbly steps forward, reaching dryer grittier sand and where grass
and trees grew. He smacked into a one which pelted him with coconuts.
Fleeing the trees Bowser entered a natural cave carved in the
mountains that cut off the beach from the rest of the land. In pure
blackness his foot splashed in a stream of water, then he heard
screeching from blood sucking swoopers around the corner. He blindly
rushed through, banging against the stalactites until he emerged from
the mountains to the dunes of Desert Land.</span></font></font></font></p>

standing ovation. &quot;What does a kingdom need?.. That's
rhetorical, Morton. It needs land which we don't have and subjects
which we've lost. Marrying Peach would make her kingdom King Dad's,
her assets his, her subjects his, her castle his. Plus you, King Dad,
like her obviously. If that happens however, there won't be a credits
screen and it's all over. We'd never have peace. Ever. There's the
Mushroom Kingdom's allies and Mario. Oh no! But what if you could
replace Peach's role in this with someone else? Someone that would
pretty much just make everyone give up? You'd get the kingdom and
maybe more! And you still like this person too? I'd say just as much
as Peach in a way,&quot; he chuckled darkly.</span></font></font></font></p>
