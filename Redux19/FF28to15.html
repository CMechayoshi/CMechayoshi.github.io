<p>&quot;It's all done so I'll just mosey on out..&quot; The janitor
stood while leaning slightly on the broom in his hand without a hint
of fatigue. One would never know the koopa paratroopa had been
working straight from this afternoon to now fixing things in the
hospital, the doors, wobbly furniture, squeaky chairs, and a computer
security breach..</p>
<p>&quot;Very well, Mr. Koopa. Give our regards to the South
hospital.&quot; Doctor Professor Koopa held open his office door but
stopped him just before he left. &quot;We know it was your brother
who infiltrated us this morning as part of that 'MKDCU' gang.&quot;</p>
<p>Probabilly kept his face unemotional. &quot;I reckon so..&quot;</p>
<p>Doctor Professor studied him for a second. &quot;Just letting you
know. If you see him, we didn't appreciate it.&quot; He went one way
from the office and Probabilly another.</p>
<p>Work had been slow in the hospital for a while with all of his
staff suddenly becoming sluggish or forgetful, even Nass who could
zip through any rush instead meddling obsessively or reorganizing her
data sheets to what was actually a detriment to productivity. With
the top staff in that shape the doctor's experiments planned had to
be canceled. He eventually nailed it down to one event, the admission
of that semi-famous toad gossip writer. He entered Mitch's room under
the guise of standard procedure, clipboard under his arm and first
darting to the monitors but paying no attention to the results.
Instead the doctor stooped down to his ear. &quot;Try something. I
know you can.&quot;</p>
<p>Mitch's body remained motionless.</p>
<p>Doctor Professor grabbed the loose power cord to the breathing
machine. Regrettably, for him, Mitch had been off of that for hours
now. Reaching into the closet, he found a spare pillow and returned
to the bedside holding it with a smirk. &quot;Don't want to talk? I
guess this won't inconvenience you much...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Eldstar, Grambi, and whoever else help me!&quot; Kylie Koopa
was huddled down halfway into her shell enduring the reckless driving
and the traffic they were cutting through at high speed. The Aston
(Martin) Mushroom ran up and scrapped onto the corner of the
sidewalk. They'd sped from the Press to the hospital. Jelectro got
out of the car and left the driver's door wide open.</p>
<p>&quot;Speedy, hold up!&quot;</p>
<p>Jelectro glanced over his shoulder while busily checking his
pockets. &quot;I have urgent 'intern' stuff to do! You drive manual
mon ami? Take my car and dispose of it, please. It's classified after
all.&quot;</p>
<p>She scooted into his seat. &quot;What's why you terrorize my
workmates, act like a wacko, and bring me here? To cover for you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, you get your scoop too.&quot; He shrugged before
scurrying off. In the lobby the visible staff were waiting around
lazily, all of them as if they had no work to do. Jelectro knew why
and where he needed to go. Even Nass at the front desk was too
lethargic to react as he sprinted right pass her.</p>
<p>Doctor Professor was pressing hard on with the pillow over the
toad for what felt like forever when someone banged on the door.
&quot;Code blue!&quot; the voice said.</p>
<p>&quot;What, again?!&quot; Doctor Professor kicked the pillow under
the bed with a groan before waltzing over to open the door. He got
snatched out and Jelectro held the doctor's collar tight, slamming
him into the wall on the opposite side.</p>
<p>&quot;I am Detective Bond and you are under arrest for conspiracy
and attempted murder. Hands up!&quot;</p>
<p>Doctor Professor raised his arms. &quot;That can't be right!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tais-toi! There was never a Giant Land hospital on that
phone that- what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know!&quot; the doctor cried.</p>
<p>&quot;-I'll finish. That called you to hold the patients without
care for fourteen hours. Why?&quot; The noki knocked him against the
wall again, gripping tighter.</p>
<p>&quot;Eh..please.. I have family!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No confession? Fine. In this fake deal the delay would allow
them to get credit for discovering that the disease is actually- Aww!
What was that?&quot;</p>
<p>In a flash the doctor's face contorted into a self satisfied half
smile. &quot;There sure are a lot of you magikoopa like freaks out
here, heh heh heh. My, what is the odds of meeting two in a day, boy?
I'll help you out since you can't steal it from my brain. They have
the Mushroom Flu which brings me back to the old days when I could
still visit the bayou before they polluted it up. I ran a butchers
shop on the side. You fish?&quot;</p>
<p>Jelectro let go and stepped back, loading his weapon. &quot;Enough!
Whether you know it or not a Bowser affiliate created the hoax! You
get nothing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Correction. The money was never the point, it was punishing
my dear 'Sweet Pea', that's Peach for ever kicking me out of the
castle in favor of those putrid incapable toad followers she started
collecting,&quot; he explained with calculated tranquility. &quot;Yeah
keep doing aiming that thing everywhere, child. Mushroom Flu works
quick so what you do to me will not-&quot; Doctor Professor was cut
off by the intercom screeching with static and screams coming
through. Then a clear voice said-</p>
<p>&quot;SOS! Theodore, g-get down here!&quot;</p>
<p>Before they could react from around the hall came a stampede of
tall and burly royal mushroom guards, the kind typically only
associated with remote locations like where Peach's father stayed out
of town, and they were showing no signs of stopping.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm a detective! Wait!&quot;</p>
<p>The crowd of guards swallowed Jelectro anyway while Doctor
Professor got a break and dashed back into Mitch's room, locking the
door. Cornered, he took a deep breath and then hurled himself out of
the window to escape. His frail body and shards of glass plopped down
in the bushes landscaping the hospital. There were trucks from the
guards all outside and even a helicopter in the sky shining down a
blinding beam that swept across the lot in search. He limped away and
into the darkness creeping over the land...</p>
<p>&quot;Boo Diddley? Is that you?&quot; 'Z' moved across the park's
green grass with a sly smile across his visage. &quot;Weren't you
that loser we all beat up at family reunions?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He looks like trouble. Let's go.&quot; Yoshi was the only
one to heed his own advice, the others not even acknowledging him.
Boo left Luigi's side and was already floating up to meet the other
boo.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't you work for Bowser now, Zoo?&quot; Booigi the Second
asked him, face to face. The sky darkened and cast a gloomy hue on
the park.</p>
<p>&quot;What if I do? Get outta my way, dweeb.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think so,&quot; Booigi hissed in Zoo's ear,
snatching his arm as well. &quot;In fact, why don't you go back to
your pathetic waste land of a home in World 8?&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi tried to wedge between the two. &quot;Alright cut it out!&quot;
Zoo slung the plumber aside.</p>
<p>&quot;Luigi?&quot; Booigi gasped, becoming their old self for a
flash before they spun back in Zoo's direction and swung with all the
fury they could muster. The dark boo's body flew backwards and into
the bushes again. Zoo lunged out of the foliage to tackle Booigi with
a roar. Both tumbled around on the ground slapping and biting and
right across Yoshi's feet.</p>
<p>&quot;Stop it! Hey! Stop!&quot; Yoshi repeated as they fought.</p>
<p>Luigi recovered as thunder boomed and some rain to sprinkle down.
People around them, sun bathers, or those walking in the park saw
this and hurriedly ran for cover. Boo, now with a black eye, tossed
Zoo away and held an object in their hand triumphantly, a green
Bowser racket!</p>
<p>&quot;This was Mario's racket!&quot; Booigi said. &quot;AND I
recognize your voice from this morning! You threatened me at the
hospital.&quot;</p>
<p>Zoo stood up and burst out in wild laughter, making Luigi and Boo
glance at each other for a second in confusion.. &quot;Hehehe tell me
what else?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;-Well since we're in a better mood now,&quot; Yoshi
interjected, &quot;know that we didn't want to start anything in the
first place. We were just taking a shortcut to the clinic.&quot;</p>
<p>Zoo turned to Yoshi. &quot;You don't say? Thanks.&quot;</p>
<p>Yoshi felt his stomach churn for some reason. &quot;Uh, why?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because that's where Mario is, right?&quot; Zoo explained
slowly to watch Yoshi's reaction. &quot;And the princess&hellip; and
even Bowser. You contacted him without telling Luigi before you
entered the park. You also know that Peach is going to shut down the
hospital!&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi tore his eyes away from the dark boo to Yoshi. &quot;You
knew all of that?! Why didn't you tell me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well- I didn't want to excite you too much with you know,
everything else and-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;-Excite me too much? Why wouldn't I be able to handle it?
I'm a Mario brother!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I didn't mean it like that, Luigi!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;-Oh you didn't!?&quot; Luigi snapped back, arms folded.
&quot;Like you know everything, old man!&quot;</p>
<p>Palm to his forehead, something clicked in Yoshi's brain and his
feelings flooded out everywhere, terrible and ugly like the storm
approaching. &quot;Maybe in fact I do! See, this is why I needed to
follow you around so you don't screw something up every five minutes
like we're doing now! You aren't some hotshot and face it, you
wouldn't have even gotten this far without me!&quot; His hand raced
to cover his mouth.</p>
<p>&quot;See ya.&quot; As perfectly planned, Zoo slipped away.</p>
<p>Before Yoshi could apologize or even attempt to explain, Booigi
tackled him down. He shielded his face as he was hurled into the mud.</p>
<p>&quot;If you're just so good, bug off from us.&quot; Luigi
dismissively walked away without turning back, focused on where Zoo
had fled to the other end of the park and through the gates. He
ignored the dinosaur's cries as they grew fainter with distance. In
his pockets was an item for drastic measures, a fire flower. One bite
of it and power surged through him, an internal inferno. He would
show Yoshi. He would show Mario. He would show anyone else who ever
doubted him. Booigi appeared on his side with a whoosh, dragging that
racket. Both followed Zoo down the sidewalk as the rain shower became
a down pour, then gained on him through dark narrow alley, Luigi's
feet splashing in frequent puddles.</p>
<p>&quot;Stop right there!&quot;</p>
<p>Zoo spun around, giving his stalkers a double take. &quot;What
the-?! You're still bothering me? Yeah I admit it, okay? I tricked
the hospital on the phone when I saw you this morning at the Mushroom
Press because I couldn't have you finding out about how everyone got
sick with the Mushroom Flu before Ludwig got into town.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Little punk,&quot; Booigi growled.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, whatever.&quot; Zoo pulled from out of nowhere a can
of Fungus Up. &quot;This is how I did it by the way. I think I got a
good sales pitch too: This drink springs up over night. It also
attracts idiots who read the Toad Town message boards. Hehehehe!
Catch poindexter.&quot;</p>
<p>He pitched it hard to Booigi who caught it automatically. &quot;No
thank you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, enough chitchat Bowser scum. Of course my brother
wouldn't be able to see the big koopa behind it all. What made you
rat yourself out? Getting your teeth knocked in by my pal? How does
it feel to be the 'nerd' now?&quot; Luigi teased.</p>
<p>Zoo traded his annoyance for amusement. &quot;You always were my
favorite Mario bro. I almost hate to do this.&quot;</p>
<p>Both of their eyebrows raised when they saw Zoo reaching for a
pale yellow little bell.</p>
<p><em>Ding...Ding...Ding..</em></p>
<p>The two walls of the alley rumbled as the ground shook. Both ran
out into the street where the businesses and restaurants around
including Club 64 were doing the same. The street lights flicked off
and power lines snapped. Mushroom citizens ran for cover under cars,
trees, or deteriorating structures as a vision appeared in the sky of
the same bell but much bigger and more transparent. The rang itself
making a deep drone noise then holographic musical notes fell from it
to the ground, landing like heavy objects. Everything around was
pelted and Luigi and Boo were forced back in the alley.</p>
<p>&quot;We gotta go! Come on!&quot; Luigi tugged Booigi just for his
hand to slip away as the boo stayed in place.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't tell me what to do!&quot; Booigi yelled back.</p>
<p>&quot;Boo?! You're not making sense! Come back!&quot; Luigi
reached out for his friend to get shoved back to the ground.</p>
<p>&quot;It's Booigi the Second! And I can do stuff now so again stop
telling me what to do!&quot; Boo swung at a power box and utterly
destroyed it. Reduced to scrap metal, sparks flew in the sky while
Boo laughed manically. They turned around but the plumber wasn't
impressed, instead pure white, horrified, and slowly backing up
before running away and leaving the little boo on the sidewalk alone.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Larry kept rocking to his MP3 player at max volume. The red shiny
'BATES by Dr. Greg' noise canceling headphones he'd stole from Roy
couldn't even comfort him. Leaning against the wall, he wondered if
he could just pull that fire alarm installed on the lower deck of the
airship. That tactic had worked for school on occasion and then they
all could just go home and life could be stable again. He was going
for it when a rainbow haired koopaling popped up in his way.</p>
<p>&quot;Larry. Stop being a jerk.&quot; Lemmy smiled and wagged a
finger.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you care? You're twenty-two so leave for the circus
already like you've cock-teased forever.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Language! I will <em>eventually</em>. Anyway we have to make
this plan work, remember the disaster at Ludwig's eighteenth
birthday? If you guys would just get onboard it would be fun!&quot;</p>
<p>Larry snorted at his older brother. &quot;Whatever. We're 'on
board' whether we like it or not.&quot; He yanked the alarm anyway
but the handle broke off and tacked on to his paw with some sort of
sticky glue. &quot;What the flip?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I disabled it while you weren't looking!&quot;</p>
<p>Larry tried to punch him and missed, striking the hard wall
instead. He yelped and held his fist as rain began to patter on the
upper decks and the ship swayed in the winds.</p>
<p>&quot;These graphics are amazing!&quot; Iggy bent all the way over
the airship's railing wearing some virtual-reality goggles strapped
to his face. They were already approaching the Mushroom Kingdom.</p>
<p>The doomship sunk farther into the clouds so that land rolled past
below them. They spotted Goomba Village with it's little wooden
homes, Koopa Village full of weaklings from their perspective, Flower
Fields where Wendy begged to visit for a bouquet, the Mushroom Mall
with no one really there, and finally Toad Town where the rain got
heavier.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone, quiet. I'm listening to WMUSH.&quot; Ludwig tuned
into the radio app with his eyes closed.</p>
<p>&quot;~BZZRT. Kingdom wide alert! Princess Peach calls for
emergency evacuation of Mushroom Kingdom Hospital for suspected
conspiracy involving dozens sick from the Mushroom Flu-&quot;</p>
<p>His eyes snapped open.</p>
<p>&quot;-Citizens advised to stay indoors due to isolated
earthquakes and storms! Stay tuned!~&quot;</p>
<p>Ludwig crushed the 'radio' with his foot and punted if off the
ship. But that wasn't a radio, that was his phone he was listening
to. The ran over to the edge in time to see it become a falling
speck. &quot;Ahhhhh!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You got no friends anyway, heh. You'll git over it,&quot;
Roy sneered.</p>
<p>Ludwig spun back towards his siblings. &quot;First of all who says
I desire mindless social contact?&quot; He cleared his throat.
&quot;Secondly the word is out on our plans! Keep heading to the
Peach Castle.&quot;</p>
<p>Kamek nodded, the one driving the airship at a steady cruising
speed over town, obscured by foggy conditions.</p>
<p>&quot;You do remember where she lives, uh right?&quot; Iggy
whispered to Kamek. &quot;Cause you're heading the wrong way.&quot;</p>
<p>Kamek adjusted his glasses with a displaced look. &quot;You mean
we aren't in town to shop for wearable blankets?&quot;</p>
<p>Ludwig spun the wheel around making the airship bank left very
hard. Now they were on the path towards Royal Raceway and a moment
later they stumbled upon Peach's antiquated castle except to
everyone's astonishment floating in the sky on a dark opaque disk. A
single light was on on an upper floor where Peach's bedroom was with
a silhouette of someone in the closed curtains. Ludwig pulled the
airship to the side.</p>
<p>&quot;Scared to go? So what they put da old shack on stilts? I
ain't impressed!&quot; Roy cracked his knuckles loudly.</p>
<p>&quot;Ooh! Ooh! I am ready, qualified, and eager to invade too!&quot;
Morton begged on his knees with a sudden bout of confidence he always
got only when Roy showed off.</p>
<p>&quot;Looks like I can test out my totally awesome mecha.&quot;
Iggy bounced with excitement while beside him was a modified
mechakoopa he controlled with the virtual reality headset strapped to
his face.</p>
<p>Reluctantly Ludwig nodded. He test fired a cannon ball which
bounced off the black disk, proving that it was tangible when the
projectile bounced off with a thud. While still having an odd feeling
about it he sent his two brothers and Iggy's toy forward. In they
disappeared behind its doors.</p>
<p>&quot;...Luddy?&quot;</p>
<p>Some amount of time later, Ludwig's day dreaming came to a halt
when Lemmy tapped his shoulder. &quot;What is it?&quot;</p>
<p>Lemmy kept his eyes to the ground. &quot;I kind of called King Dad
again. Wait, before you get mad he's still in town and he's with
Peach!&quot;</p>
<p>Stunned, Ludwig craned back towards the princess's abode. &quot;This
who is in..&quot;</p>
<p>The castle's doors were nearly knocked off the hinges by Roy
charging out with a brown capped toad tucked under his arm like a
foot ball. The mechakoopa was right behind him and Morton stumbling
along. Frantically they hurled themselves over the rails and back
aboard the airship nearly running over Larry.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, freaking watch it!&quot; the teen exclaimed.</p>
<p>Roy panted heavily with his hands on his knees. Behind his shades
his eyes were dilated and wide open, but to everyone else he just
seemed like he'd came from a winning Koopaball game. The toad,
Toadsworth dropped from his grasp and was too dazed to have a
reaction. Morton flopped down like a dead cheep cheep on the ship's
deck, right under the rigging, his sweat making him about as wet as a
cheep cheep as well. Wendy rolled him on his back with her foot
revealing second youngest's glazed over and slobbering look.</p>
<p>Ludwig went straight to Iggy. He was at edge of the guard rails
giggling while crouched down. &quot;You were recording live with that
mechakoopa, correct?&hellip; Iggy!&hellip;&quot; Ludwig began to feel
a pit deep within. &quot;Iggy are you with us?&quot;</p>
<p>Iggy faced him stiltedly, like a machine in need of oil.
&quot;Hehhehehehehehehehe.&quot;</p>
<p>Ludwig ripped off Iggy's goggles but everything was normal.. By
Iggy standards that was..</p>
<p>&quot;Hiii Luddy, er.. what are we yelling about? Whoa!&quot;</p>
<p>Ludwig grabbed and shook him. &quot;What events did you witness in
there?!&quot; Lemmy, Larry, and Wendy crowded around to hear.</p>
<p>&quot;Beautiful girls interested in me, limited edition figurines
on sale, and and.. my therapist telling me I'm not crazy...&quot;</p>
<p>Ludwig let him go, beaming despite the situation. &quot;Change of
plan. Larry, escort Roy, Morton, and Iggy and our hostage downstairs
until they recover from their mania.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Aww man! Wait&hellip; we can go home?&quot; Larry asked
optimistically.</p>
<p>&quot;Absolutely not. Where was Vater, Lemmy?&quot;</p>
<p>Lemmy gave a start at the sudden attention. &quot;The Toadley
Clinic. He was in the middle of a conference or something but-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then we shall go. Kamek?&quot; Ludwig woke the magikoopa out
of the snoring he was doing. &quot;Take us there!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You say Kammy's taking me on a hot date?!&quot; Kamek
babbled, snapping awake. &quot;Sure, you brat!&quot;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&quot;Technology is ridiculous. Y'all are gonna tell me next that
you can speak to someone across the planet in real time!&quot; Bowser
remarked as he tapped the blanked out computer monitor with a sharp
claw, nearly ruining it and incurring an equally sharp bill.</p>
<p>The Skype call with several doctors in a Special World Hospital
conference room got disconnected while a shady goomba called Dr. Goom
went out to get someone called Dr. Toad. It turned out Bowser just
stepped on the Ethernet cord at some point. It was plugged back and
the connection resumed. Mario sat in a chair backwards while politely
listening to the jargon and confabulation the remote doctors were
doing. He tried to keep anxious thoughts down as his attention
occasionally returned to the sick patients in the room still on the
beds. The gloomy atmosphere was enhanced by the lights being dimmed
to see the screen better.</p>
<p>Peach sat in a chair properly besides the plumber. &quot;Daddy
called me back. He sent an entire squadron there and they said it was
successful except they didn't find Dr. Professor Koopa.&quot; She
sighed. &quot;I think daddy's sending them to another hospital down
south near Mt. Rugged that I know isn't corrupt.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;-I knew never spring cleaning the office would pay off, so
this is our proposal,&quot; Dr. Toad told the screen, gaining Mario
and Peach's attention again. He was monotone speaking and very young
adult looking toad with a red cap, not who they expected to be the
president of such a place. &quot;I have some old case files on the
Mushroom Flu. Where are your patients now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are some here? Yes they are. Are some elsewhere? That too,&quot;
Dr. Toadley answered inches away from the monitor.</p>
<p>&quot;Excellent. Unfortunately Dr. Mario was the authority on
Mushroom Flu and he's not with us anymore. Still, we'll give it all
we got,&quot; Dr. Toad said with a shy but earnest smile. The
transmission was cut again shortly after, not due to Bowser stepping
on a cord again, but rather Dr. Toadley's satellite suffering
attenuation. They heard a little thunder in the distance and then it
all made sense. Really it was almost a miracle they'd stayed
connected as long as they had.</p>
<p>&quot;You heard that kid, Peach. We got this.&quot; Mario gently
held her hand as she kept staring at the blank screen. &quot;What's
wrong?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;..Oh!&quot; She turned to him with a flush. &quot;Just the
toads from the castle were supposed to get here by now so I think
I'll check outside.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't worry too much now. They can take care of themselves,&quot;
Mario replied more offhanded than he meant. He quickly apologized,
flipping the chair the correct way so that he would lean back in it
with his legs crossed. Dr. Toadley's minesweeper game, beeping
computers, and Bowser getting attacked by Birdley was going on in the
background. &quot;But they are mostly adults and you do get a little
tired of them, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I mean, they're not going to work in your castle forever.
Best they learn the simple stuff.&quot; He found her suddenly missing
from his side.</p>
<p>How dare Mario go there again, she thought. Her toads were not
mere employees to her, well they were on paper and legally since the
regime change that put her in office, but still. Peach was outside
with her parasol where the rain shower beat down heavily and her
toads were nowhere to be found at the bus stop. She noticed Emery
still manning Bowser's Koopa copter after all this time and without
shelter which dissipated the petty irritation bubbling. After all the
princess couldn't let her suffer, baddie or not.</p>
<p>&quot;Here you go.&quot; Peach tilted it over Emery's head. &quot;Dear,
you should come inside before you catch a cold.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well thanks,&quot; Emery almost chuckled, not sure how to
react. &quot;But I've been through worse.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;-Why did you join Bowser?&quot; Peach knew she shouldn't pry
but the question had already slipped and reassuringly Emery didn't
seem offended.</p>
<p>&quot;Because&hellip; It's not personal with you or anything. I
just didn't see myself falling in line with the other toads for the
rest of my life and it's kind of ironic because my mom Nass was from
Dark Land and was always complaining about it and wanting to move to
the Mushroom Kingdom. For me. That was when she cared. Never mind. I
dunno how to explain it. I know I sound weird right now but I'm okay
with that. Plus Bowser hired me on the spot.&quot;</p>
<p>Peach nodded, thankful for that bit of honesty even if it made her
feel guilty for assuming there could be no valid reason to side with
Bowser. In the end of the day though, people were people and it
wasn't black and white like that. At least she hoped.. What was that
part at the end about her mother caring? Peach was about to speak
again-</p>
<p>&quot;There you are!&quot; Zoo randomly ran up to both women.
&quot;I've been all over the place looking for you!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you are?&quot; Peach stepped back.</p>
<p>Zoo leaned on the koopa copter, smiling oddly at the princess.
&quot;Just a guy. It don't matter anyway, chick. They're here. Also,
you're hot this close. I've only seen you on posters before.&quot;</p>
<p>Everyone heard that familiar drone of a koopa airship approaching
and fast. It's exact location wasn't obvious until it emerged from
the low hanging clouds, but when it did the two hundred foot long
vessel was impossible to miss swooping down with the anchor swinging
their way. Bowser and Mario bolted out the doors to see the ship.</p>
<p>&quot;Attention our lovely and dear princess!&quot; Ludwig's voice
rang from above through an intercom like system. &quot;Us, the Koopa
Troop take full responsibility for the tragedies of today, the sudden
illness of your friends and mushroom citizens, AND the event
affecting your castle right now!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You guys did that?!&quot; Mario shouted.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, you did?&quot; Bowser added, scratching his head.</p>
<p>&quot;Correct and here is the proof, we have your Toadsworth!&quot;
The sound of the old mushroom being shoved around before the mic was
heard before Peach begged them to stop.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you want?&quot; she plead.</p>
<p>&quot;We request for Mario to surrender and for you to kindly step
onboard, princess. It's quite nice here with a space heater and
certainly more dry than your current predicament! The weather will be
even nicer in Dark Land!&hellip; Except on Tuesdays...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you work for Bowser and I can tell you do, this is when
we sneak on board,&quot; Zoo told Emery down low. Undetectable in the
chaos they climbed up the chain from the anchor. Emery always kind of
wanted to do this, just not in a storm and at the suggestion of a
sleazy dark boo. A gentle hand from Wendy confusingly let her on. Z
waited for his turn.</p>
<p>&quot;Get your tail up here, garbage man!&quot; Larry instead
grabbed him and pulled him up rough, making him flop face first on
the hard and splintery airship flooring.</p>
<p>&quot;Never!&quot; Mario replied to Ludwig back on the ground.
&quot;And you knew about this all day, Bowser?&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser turned to him speechless. Was this what he wanted? The
princess right besides him, trembling, vulnerable.. But- What was the
'but'? He didn't know.</p>
<p>&quot;Bowser?&quot; Mario repeated with an edge.</p>
<p>Bowser's gaze panned from Peach to the plumber and they held the
look for a moment that felt much longer. &quot;Plumber breath?
There's something on your face&hellip;.This!&quot; Bowser punched
Mario, knocking him all the way back through the Toadley Clinic's
doors with a great crash. Peach screamed as he scooped her up in one
quick motion and grabbed the chain, climbing up while the airship
increased it's altitude.</p>
<p>&quot;Mariooooooooo!&quot; Peach called as loud as she could.</p>
<p>Mario untangled himself from the chairs he'd rolled into and shook
off the sharp glass to dash out. He saw the anchor and chain rising,
catching it barely with a triple jump. He vigorously climbed higher
ignoring the minor bleeding from cuts all over, the straining of his
muscles holding on, and the numerous times he slipped from rain. He
could hear his princess's voice above and that pushed him harder than
ever. He was almost over the edge of the airship when Ludwig's dark
face appeared over with a scowl, hair flowing in the wind.</p>
<p>&quot;No you do not, Mario. I have waited FIVE YEARS for this and
I swear to Eldstar you will not impede on my mission! My destiny!
Curses you!&quot; He raised up his scepter but before using it a clap
of thunder sent a bolt from the sky. With a spectacular and eye
searing flash both koopaling and plumber were sent flying, Ludwig
back into the rigging of the ship and Mario off completely to plunge
below and fall a great distance.</p>
<p>It was over.</p>
<p>With Mario out, <em>Bowser wins</em>.</p>

<p>At last after a torturous hour or more, Peach could perceive her
surroundings as a flickering overhead light made up its mind and
remained switched on. Tied securely to a thick wooden support beam in
the bowels of the doomship it was pitch black until then. The other
being, her fellow company just a few feet away made her recant nearly
all the dark devastating thoughts that were whirling in her brain
during the ride from the Mushroom Kingdom to Dark Land she didn't ask
for. Trusted and dear Toadsworth tied to a pole in like manner was
seemingly okay if unconscious or exhausted. She didn't even see a
bruise or out of place clothing article on the man, quite a miracle
stashed among unmanned cannons, stacks of ammo, discarded shopping
bags, trash, and the occasional mouser. Peach suppressed a shiver and
took a deep breath as desperation crawled back into the corners of
her mind. Being kidnapped by Bowser there was always a twist to his
schemes that she could see immediately. This scheme's spiral she
could not however see the end of yet- Not even close, and that was
terrifying as the creaks and squeaks moans of the tired old airship
putting in the skies and its engines roaring in demented rhythm.</p>
<p>Soon natural light spread onto her from an open hatch and fresher
air blew down.</p>
<p>&quot;How's it going? We're almost home so uh.. brace yourself!&quot;
Lemmy smiled amiably from the upper deck.</p>
<p>Peach gave the koopaling a mildly indignant stare in return as she
felt the ship tilting down, getting shakier the lower they went.
She'd surprised herself just then losing her temper so early in the
'game'. Normally she remained either stoic or played up the damsel in
distress role while in Bowser's clutches. In her mind that just made
the ordeal be over with sooner. Shortly the ship landed violently and
forces sent loose ammo careening all around with many close calls.
When things has calmed down a shopping bag from 'Tirade-N-Trade'
landed completely over Peach's head and she could do nothing about
it. Some petit yet calloused hands untied her a moment later.</p>
<p>&quot;Stop being so gentle, Lemmy. LET'S GO!&quot; Ludwig's voice
barked from above, barely audible along with the stomping feet of the
crew departing the ship.</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry..&quot; Lemmy said coyly and then snickered to
himself.</p>
<p>Peach, blinded but at least gently just as Ludwig didn't wish for,
was lead out the ship from one horrid location to another. The air
smelt like ash and brimstone that would burn the nostrils of most,
but not her. She was prodded across dry cracked soil and then stone
and then through the entrance of Bowser castle with the fleet of the
ship. The tall metal doors shut behind her with a slam that echoed.</p>
<p>&quot;Send the princess to the deluxe holding room!&quot; Bowser
commanded nearly in her ear, close on the left. They marched up some
red carpeted halls. She really wished they'd remove her what was her
blindfold essentially. Not that it impeded her getting around because
of familiarity with Bowser's Castle...</p>
<p>&quot;And what of your upcoming matrimony?&quot; Ludwig inquired
on Peach's opposite side.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm thinking 'bout it. It's all together in my head. The
piranha plant bouquets, the white suit and tie- oh and lava!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Always the lava, is it Vater?&quot; Ludwig replied airily.
&quot;What of her considerations? Human's don't usually like molten
rock. What if perhaps we hire a professional for once? I know someone
out of town. Actually erm, several! Speaking of something out of
town-&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser tore his gaze from the princess to his eldest son. &quot;Listen,
I know we're all feeling good 'cause of our success tonight but this
is the first time I've heard your input on this kind of thing. Huh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;..Nothing,&quot; Ludwig trailed off.</p>
<p>Peach was lead away and Bowser and the others from the airship
dispersed into their usual areas in the castle. Roy, Morton, and Iggy
were conscious enough to enter on their own two feet but got sluggish
upon the first room in Bowser's Castle, a torch lit hallway with a
high ceiling. Zoo was then tasked to drag them to their rooms and
hostage Toadsworth to the dungeons.</p>
<p>&quot;Old man, come the crap on!&quot; Zoo pushed Toadsworth onto
the carpet.</p>
<p>Toadsworth stumbled forward then turned his head, his blank beady
eyes peering into the dark boo'ss. &quot;Ring it...&quot; were the
first words he'd said in hours.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, dat's it. Ring your bell,&quot; Roy mumbled.</p>
<p>&quot;What he said! Words! A synonym. Another to that!&quot;
Morton piped up in a robotic fashion.</p>
<p>Iggy kept giggling while hugging himself, his blue eyes dilated.</p>
<p>Thoroughly freaking out, Zoo felt a pain in his stomach. He found
the nearest guard, a koopatrol stationed in the next corridor.
Standing off to the side under an archway he was speaking to Emery,
that new toad girl mook of theirs that King Bowser hired on the spot
or some crap in Toad Town. Zoo didn't make the recruitment rules nor
care..</p>
<p>&quot;-Yeah ha ha, just uh, take it I guess. I don't need this old
thing. I'm a shut in anyways.&quot; The Koopatrol handed her a Dark
Land travel pass in a plastic bag. These let citizens use the
kingdom's transport services whether bus, train, or economically
getting shot out of a cannon. &quot;You're getting a room downtown
for the night?&quot;</p>
<p>After a second's hesitation Emery accepted the pass with a blush
over her features. &quot;Thanks. Uh huh, gonna find something in Neo
Bowser City.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Close haha?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We'll seeee!&quot; she sang. &quot;Now I'll leave you alone.
I'll make it up to you I promise okay? See ya.&quot;</p>
<p>The koopatrol kept grinning stupidly as she left down the hall.
Zoo zoned in right behind her. &quot;Bro! Hey help me out!&quot; he
yelled, making the guard drop his spear in a klutzy manner.</p>
<p>&quot;Zoo? What are you doing here late?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't play retarded, Tanner! Remember? We were texting about
what I was gonna do today all last night! I was with King Bowser kids
'cause I won that raffle a while to help with the Mushroom Flu
scheme. Duuude I could do whatever I wanted most of the flipping
time!&quot; Zoo explained, his dark features lightening up from
excitement. &quot;Now stop flirting with that basic toad brat. Like
that'll work out when she finds out you're always thinking about that
weird super crown thing... Like now.&quot;</p>
<p>Tanner swiftly retrieved the spear before some other guard could
rat him out speaking with the castle's janitor. A thought flashed in
his head that his telepathic friend may have done something sinister
as he was often unfortunately and impulsively inclined. &quot;Shhh! I
just forgot. Busy day. I wish I won and got to visit Toad Town where
the sun actually shines.. I have permanent tan lines from this helmet
and not the good kind.. Hey. You didn't do something, like, messed up
right? All alone for hours? With no supervision?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hahahaha... Forget about it, bro.&quot; Zoo felt a little
bad to lie to his only friend. But only a little. Said raffle from
last week was a 'Humanitarian' effort by Ludwig to give staff of the
castle more fresh air. Zoo rarely won stuff so he decided he would be
a winner this time. Before announcements were he made tracked down
the original winner after reading their mind while in the mess hall,
followed them home, hid the body by morning, and clocked in normally
for his janitorial shift to await the announcement of the new winner.
Zoo Sue Diddley! Zoo pat Tanner on the shoulder. &quot;-I'm not going
to get you in trouble this time bro. Just help me move these guys
back there so I can clock out and snore in my freaking bed and
probably wet it in the night because I have issues and refuse to take
my medications!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Whoa okay! Didn't need to know!&quot; Tanner laughed. He
peeked around to make sure other's weren't patrolling. &quot;You got
any souvenirs from Toad Town?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Here. This is supposed to be real fancy.&quot; Zoo winked,
handing him a Lexus emblem taken from a certain car crash earlier.</p>
<p>Soon Tanner was impressively supporting Roy and Morton on each
side and Iggy on his back, hauling them while Zoo was dragging around
Toadsworth to the dungeons. Zoo had gotten into a lot more trouble
today than he usually had a chance too, but that was his past. His
future would be counting sheep.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Larry was on his bed face down in a pile of old clothes, wrestling
magazines, and leftover takeout boxes feeling queasy to his gut. His
father wasn't holding the princess for games with that other
important person in his life, Mario like usual. Instead rushing
incoming wedding plans. Earlier Kammy hogging up space in the
hallways mentioned something that Larry couldn't shake off. Of if
Bowser was to have more children..</p>
<p>&quot;Larry, could you bring the laptop to my room?&quot; Ludwig
texted him. Larry pulled himself out of bed and obeyed without
thinking about it. That's how he knew he was frazzled when he didn't
care who's grubby hands were on his laptop. All of the Koopalings
shared a floor in the castle and Ludwig's was at the very end with a
carved antique door and an iron cast knocker that had no place
indoors but was allowed for the Koopa Troop general.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you. I'm examining the contents of a hard drive and
Iggy likes to encrypt data so it might take a moment,&quot; Ludwig
explained with a touch of drowsiness after accepting. Beyond him
Larry could see the mechakoopa on Ludwig's neat and tidy bed. &quot;I
must know what happened and then shop for a tuxedo. Time waits for no
koopa..&quot;</p>
<p>Ludwig opened the laptop on his bed only for it to close down on
this fingers. &quot;Ouch! Bl&ouml;der Dell X-piece of&hellip;&quot;
he muttered, adjusting the broken hinge. He connected a cable to the
mechakoopa to examine the raw footage. Rife with digital artifacts
the video followed his brothers inside the castle then got black. He
adjusted brightness to no avail so he leaned in closely and strained
his eyes, not noticing the black particles escaping from the screen
and congregating in the room surrounding his work desk, bookshelves
of literature, musical instruments, and his large trophy wall with a
single badge of honor missing...</p>
<p>Larry stood outside the bedroom door that was slammed in his face
moments before, that last utterance of his big brother repeating over
and over within. Time. He had none lose.. He bolted upstairs and rung
the bell outside Peach's cell. The special room was in a spire of the
castle with a window and a furnished vintage inspired but kitschy
interior Kamek insisted they let Kammy decorate years ago.</p>
<p>&quot;Yo. I'm coming in, princess.&quot; Larry composed himself
noticing he was jittery, and then pushed the door open. Peach was
seated legs curled in the wicker chair near the window watching the
purple dusk sky, the setting sun obscured behind the perpetual Dark
Land cloud coverage. The vanity and bed set still had thick layers of
dust meaning she hadn't got comfortable yet. &quot;I, uh, I just
wanted to tell you-&quot;</p>
<p>Peach remained fixed outdoors. He imagined with a steely gaze too.
&quot;I know Bowser is planning a wedding. Is Toadsworth well in the
dungeons? He's sensitive to mold and cold food.&quot;</p>
<p>Surprisingly that took some of the edge out of the teenage
koopaling. Little did they know apparently, the entire castle had a
cold and moldy food problem. &quot;He's fine. So I'm here actually
because I was gonna like, r-rescue you?&quot; That was foreign to
roll off of Larry's tongue, yet so furtively invigorating. &quot;-Cause
I can't let dad marry you and have- oh Eldstar no! More kids!&quot;</p>
<p>She twisted his way and shuddered. &quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm gonna pull a Mario. I ain't gotta license- I mean I did
but it got taken way when I ran over Bowser's toe during a drag race.
I can't fight the best- though I did break a kids nose at school once
with brass knuckles. And I can't strategize, well I can if I cheating
off homework, but that's different. Basically I ain't got an idea of
how to do it but I'll make it happen. I'm getting you out of here.&quot;</p>
<p>Peach nodded quickly at his words, delighted and overwhelmed at
the same time. She had an early ticket out of here. Maybe. Hidden in
a pocket- her dress indeed had one no one really knew about- was her
cellphone that escaped confiscation because she was hardly known to
use it. It was even fully charged from lack of use during the day.
&quot;If I was to call help, would anyone in this castle know? Would
that help your plan? Or hurt it?&quot; she sputter.</p>
<p>Larry paused with a vacant awkward expression. It set in that he'd
just outwardly defected, not just from the powerful Mushroom World
organization of the Koopa Troop, but also from his own fresh and
blood family. He realized labeling himself a rebel as a persona and
grumbling in his mind and being one in real life an actually doing
something was a different ball game weighting heavily on his
shoulders. And he wasn't much of a lifter... &quot;Sorry.. spaced out
Peach. Can I call you that? I wont tell nobody about your phone. I
gotta get to bed before I get caught and grounded so we'll figure
stuff out tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, I really mean it.&quot;</p>
<p>Larry stopped at the door with a flush. He could have sworn she
was smiling a bit. &quot;..Yeah. You're welcome.&quot; Outside the
door he nearly had a heart attack being rushed by his sister Wendy.
She was fitted in pink robe and with a bonnet ready for bed but
instead up in his grill instead.</p>
<p>&quot;Lil brat, let's get to daddy's throne room. Now!&quot; She
dragged him away.</p>
<p>&quot;Lay off, ugly. Why?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know? Why did it take me forever to find you up
here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was gonna prank the princess by ringing the doorbell and
then bailing. That's why!&quot;</p>
<p>She sighed, pinching his ear. &quot;Everyone knows about your
problematic pranking stunt Youtube channel so you'd never gotten away
with it. Just march or else!&quot;</p>
<p>Larry quickened his pace downstairs.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&quot;Luddy, wake up! King Dad wanted to talk to us all.&quot;</p>
<p>Slumped over his desk, Ludwig lifted his face from the laptop it
was buried in. Imprints from the keyboard and crust from drooling
marred his face. His eyes burned badly, or rather it was the five
pointed star shape burning under his eyelids causing the discomfort.
One Lemmy split to three as he tried to focus, mumbling in agreement
to whatever was being asked of him from his closest brother.</p>
<p>&quot;What is the pressing matter Vater?&quot; Refreshed as much
as two minutes could do for him, Ludwig stationed himself closest to
Bowser at his throne. His siblings minus Junior who was still at camp
lined up behind him, even Roy, Morton, and Iggy who became normal as
the night hours rolled by but with no recollection of the Peach's
Castle events. Wordlessly the Koopalings took note that their father
had reverted to his ill-tempered and jaded self who hadn't had enough
coffee. A foot of the Koopa King stomped the ground, jolting
everything in the room.</p>
<p>&quot;I need answers now, Ludwig! Explain how your scheme today
worked since it was just SO good you needed it to be secret.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah hem. It started with Sam and Slam, friends of Iggy who
are usually video-game collectors but also own a shipping truck
company- Excuse me no. It started when virus samples were found in
some old lab archives. You may recall the Mushroom Flu from two
decades ago. Then we found some vintage cans of Fungus Up for us to
taint with a Mushroom Flu virus,&quot; Ludwig explained with an
unusual lack of grace. &quot;Iggy's acquaintances then shipped them
into town. Finally the winning minion of my new program, Zoo, was
sent into Toad Town distribute the sodas and deliver some to Toad and
Daisy, high profile victims. There are extra cans in our basement.&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser kept shaking his head. &quot;Then?!&quot; he snapped. &quot;How
does that crazy thing with Peach's Castle happen?&quot;</p>
<p>Ludwig knew what this was all really about and he gulped. &quot;I
must humbly admit that I nor my siblings orchestrated that part. We
stumbled upon the phenomenon in search of Peach in the city and I
thought to feign responsibility you know as a bargaining uh chip. I
am the best negotiator.&quot;</p>
<p>The Koopalings collectively agreed with Ludwig. It was one of
those situations they all knew they were in hot water if they didn't
start kissing tail.</p>
<p>&quot;SHUT UP EVERYONE SHUT UP! Alright, you have ZERO clue?
Listen to this then.&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser summoned to the door a lakitu with balaclava, riding a
darkened stealthy cloud. His intense eyes scanned the room before he
entered, making the Koopalings clam up. &quot;Sentry #11 reporting.
This info got relayed across the six kingdoms in between us and the
Mushroom Kingdom, boss. The leaked Toad Town news report for Saturday
morning will be 'Princess kidnapped, Bowser's agent wreak havoc on
city by suspending her castle in sky, displacing her toads, and
attacking historic buildings downtown.' We got an image taken by a
bystander repossessed by our Koopa Troop scouts.&quot; The lakitu
retrieved from his shell a photo that Bowser had already seen but was
new to the Koopalings. It showed a crystalline bell shape in the sky
with musical notes raining down, not unlike what rained from the
platform that held Peach's Castle in the sky.</p>
<p>Ludwig faced away, hand resting on his chin. &quot;You are
implying our worker did this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sounds like it,&quot; Bowser answered, crossing one leg over
the other. &quot;It said an AGENT of mine, not you brats. So speak
up!&quot;</p>
<p>Ludwig felt the life return to him. &quot;Yes Vater. Zoo the
steward, even if I don't even remember picking him, did his job well.
All of the disorder in Toad Town contributed to our success today.
And the look on that plumber's face when he was craning his neck
towards our airship? Priceless!&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser sighed and did slow clap.</p>
<p>&quot;-Oh boss! I forgot to mention that the person that met our
scouts at the rendezvous tonight was that Toad Town reporter, Kylie
Koopa,&quot; the sentry spoke up, gaining a curious tone in his
voice. &quot;She ran the scouts off and hinted that she'd reveal the
dark boo involvement. What do you say about that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If the princess is with us now their threats don't mean
nothin'. You can go Sentry. Actually. All of ya. Get!&quot;</p>
<p>Everyone trickled out of the room except Ludwig who lagged behind
as if leaving but quickly shut the door and left himself in the room
with Bowser. He spun around intrepidly. &quot;Vater. One thing. I did
not conceal my plan to be witty or to prove a point as I might
usually do. I had a grander purpose.&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser eyed him skeptically then got up from the throne and tucked
the newspaper he'd been reading under his arm. &quot;Really now?&quot;
He causally walked out, forcing Ludwig to trail behind him.</p>
<p>&quot;-I hoped the scheme would allow me to achieve the 'Honorary
Mega-Villain' badge. Do you think so? Should I submit the case to the
judges out of town?&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser shrugged dismissively which Ludwig hated to admit hurt a
bit. &quot;You know I don't care about the opinions of those
magikoopa Villain Council weirdos and I don't know why you do either.
If you weren't a good general I'd have fired you already. But go on.
Get your badge. Just hope that Zoo guy doesn't want to speak up about
how all of that really destructive stuff was really his work and not
yours<em>. </em>Cause he'll be the one earning it then. Ha!&quot;</p>
<p>Ludwig nearly felt the floor give way beneath him. His work and
not yours?</p>
<p>HIS work and NOT yours?!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&quot;Don't linger you two!&quot; Ludwig called back to the
others, lifting the hood from his messy blue hair. The torch light he
was holding cast his shadow on the side of a hut. He with Lemmy and
Iggy were tiptoeing around the village near the castle while everyone
else were in bed. Lemmy wasn't fooled by him sneaking around and
insisted he follow while Iggy was intentionally brought along for
some useful night vision gadgets. It helped that all three had night
owl tendencies for their own reasons, music composition, science
projects/ videogames, or gym practice. Ludwig carried under his arm
something from his personal library, 'Ex spatio obiecti specialem
lexicon' which he'd studied into the early hours. He knocked on the
shabby door of a particular shack on an isolated path near a forest.
Wind howled in the barren trees as he kept beating the door.</p>
<p>&quot;Kind of creepy but this would be an epic place for an anime
battle,&quot; Iggy mentioned out of the blue. &quot;Or maybe a spot
where the world ends!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Iggy, quit that please,&quot; Ludwig said.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe our guy's sleep,&quot; Lemmy advised over Ludwig's
left shoulder.</p>
<p>&quot;Just a little longer my trusted adjutants. I <em>shan't</em>
give up,&quot; he replied more to reassure himself than them.
Squeezing his eyes shut, Ludwig still had that afterimage of a dark
star, even with each blink and beneath his bonhomie and the forced
smiles it was getting annoying. He couldn't remember whatever footage
he saw on the laptop screen that did this to him. When he again
checked the laptop it had just died forever.</p>
<p>A lamp behind a blanket drooped over the window cut on and the
door swung open. &quot;Listen you crazy neighbors I gotta get up and
work everyday so if you try to knock one more time!-&quot; Zoo froze
with a deer in headlights expression. &quot;...I mean come in I
guess?&quot;</p>
<p>Smiling politely his rulers shed the night vision gear, dropped
the torches, and entered the small space. Zoo's cabin was one room
with an old beige couch that let out to a bed, a rusty electric stove
in the corner, and some pins and other objects and junk for juggling
in the opposite corner.</p>
<p>&quot;Greetings. I know the hour is late but we're are only here
to verify exactly what you did yesterday,&quot; Ludwig said. &quot;It
is.. urgent because Bowser now requires field reports and we missed
your witness statements before.&quot;</p>
<p>Zoo felt the spotlight on him again. He couldn't tell what they
were thinking because his contacts weren't in and he saw thoughts as
floating words. He was in the dark too. He was tardy on the power
bill sometimes. &quot;That. Okay so I scribbled 'free' where the
sodas were dropped off then I got pretend hired at the newspaper
press so I could learn about the tennis game and then I went there-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;-Excuse me, but what of your actions pertaining to Peach's
castle floating in the sky?&quot;</p>
<p>Iggy nodded. &quot;Because it was super cool to look at before I
blanked out I guess. Like when Koopau fought the Super Plumbers in
the fourth dimension on that raised platform..&quot;</p>
<p>Zoo pointed to a little wooden box with the juggling pile. Inside
was the small yellow translucent bell with a warm but pale glow to
it. &quot;So I lost this thing for a long time but it showed up again
recently. I took it with me and crazy stuff just kept on happening!
You don't think I'm tripping do you? Just don't take it out the-&quot;</p>
<p>Lemmy tried to touch it, granting the reward of a horrible zap to
his claw, even scorching it black. &quot;Youch!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeeeeah. That'll happen bro. I got used to it back in the
day.&quot;</p>
<p>Heart skipping a beat, Ludwig opened his book to a page he'd
marked. &quot;<em>Gesundheit</em>! That is the 'Doom Reverb' as I
suspected! It says here that this possessive object is in particular
a physical manifestation of a dark star cast to the Earth by the
guardians of the pure hearted.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You believe that?&quot; Lemmy shared glances from Ludwig to
the bell in the box. The athlete wasn't into flashing things that
weren't gold medals but he had to admit it seemed special somehow.
&quot;You used to be so staunch about that stuff being a.. whatever
big words you used.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<em>A 'speciest and nationalistic concept</em>' which I felt
then and do believe still in a way considering that no one is ever
indoctrinated to believe that the Star Spirits, Guardians, whatever
you want to call them protect us Koopa races, but instead the
blissful toads of the world. The undeserving and ungrateful
little...regardless that debate is not the same as the one of whether
they actually exist and affect the world around us. My official
opinion, worldly and secular Kingly Law tradition aside, is that they
certainly do and I'm usually right. You know it. I am no Philistine!&quot;</p>
<p>Lemmy playfully rolled his eyes. &quot;So humble..&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I could have told you that aliens, wishes, stars, and the
Fang-Fairy are real, just saying,&quot; Iggy added. He got dope
slapped.</p>
<p>&quot;And you also think that attractive females want to date you
Iggy..&quot; Ludwig shrugged.</p>
<p>Iggy stood up to him defensively. &quot;And? They do! Wendy told
me it's just that my fedora makes them shy but they secretly want me
and if I keep sending them letters they'll confess any minute.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Iggy, chill,&quot; Lemmy added.</p>
<p>Ludwig nodded. &quot;-Okay, we are wasting our dear janitor's time
are we not? Bring it closer.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, whatever.&quot; Zoo let Ludwig peer into the box with
the Doom Reverb. The moment it was in his palms his eyes felt heavy
and he had to resist or else he'd be looking at that inverse burned
in star on the other side of his eyelids. A mental war went on, his
agency phasing away. But.. Ludwig was never one to allow a landside.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you alright?&quot; Lemmy asked while brother's head kept
tilting downwards.</p>
<p>He blinked a few times, box right hand and book in left. &quot;Fine
fine. I'll continue to read the passage. This object.. holds reality
threatening power&hellip; power of what the Dark Star chooses to
manifest depends&hellip; on the times the item is.. used. Ownership
can.. pass on through physical possession or.. DEATH. Wow. Ah hem,
and the owner holding some&hellip; psionic power to link.. to the
bell and the cosmos increases strength&hellip;. Exponentially...&quot;</p>
<p>The eyelids closed at last, the calmness of sleep absent. Ludwig
felt a pressure from inside out while his brain clouded with a thick
fog. He could feel himself drifting farther away with nothing he
could do about it. He separated from his body all together.</p>
<p>The three other people in the room had stopped paying attention to
the reading for one reason on another. Lemmy couldn't keep his focus
off of some vintage circus equipment Zoo owned for some reason. A
rolled up banner spelled out 'The Juggling Diddley'. Lemmy kept up
with vintage circus performers and there was something odd about the
story of that Donut Plains native juggler that kept nagging at him.
Iggy was checking a status of an RPG character on his phone. Zoo
became sidetracked by that as well, as Tanner played a game like it
and he'd been wanting to get into it if he could ever keep a
smartphone for more than a month without breaking it.</p>
<p>&quot;I've been meaning to ask how you are our castle's best poker
player that even beat that computer A.I. I designed one time to play
perfectly. Luddy deduced you have some sort of super power. Is that
it?&quot; Iggy mumbled.</p>
<p>&quot;Me? No way bro!&quot; Zoo denied more loudly than he meant.
His brief apprehension was unneeded because Ludwig was sleeping while
standing. For a moment.</p>
<p>Ludwig's vivid blue eyes opened and he shut the box close to him
against his cloak, dropping his book. &quot;As your Prince I command
you to give this item to me! Your bell is now mine!&quot;</p>
<p>Zoo was dazed for a second. &quot;W-what? Noooo way! That's like a
heirloom and I ain't got much. Do I look freaking rich? I bet you
just want all the credit from earlier!&quot;</p>
<p>'Oh typical entitled Luddy,' Lemmy thought. He pulled back
forcefully on his brother's stiff shoulders, inwardly guilty he'd
zoned out of whatever lead up this this egotistic outburst from
Ludwig. &quot;Luddy. Cut this out. Don't be a jerk,&quot; he told him
in his so called 'serious' tone.</p>
<p>Ludwig in turn knocked Lemmy into the stove corner to clash
against pots and pans. When Ludwig turned his head Zoo had snatched
the box back.</p>
<p>&quot;Try me sucker!&quot; The boo escaped the house, phasing
through Ludwig and the walls.</p>
<p>Ludwig charged out while Lemmy climbed away from the pile of
cookware with a pan on his head. &quot;Iggy! After Luddy! Son of a
biscuit! Something was off with his eyes and I didn't see it at
first. He's gone crazy like you guys did earlier!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh snap!&quot; Iggy slapped his forehead.</p>
<p>The 'twin' brothers (though no one had considered them such for a
long time now) sprinted out together. In the moonlight Ludwig was on
the prowl after Zoo through a forest path of rough terrain and
piranha plants and nippers waiting. It all lead to a clearance
leading to a cliff and at the bottom of the long drop was barren land
with brambles. Hunched over Ludwig approached the boo who peered over
the edge. Zoo misread a sign and missed the path that would have lead
eventually into Neo Bowser City. Instead he was at a dead end.</p>
<p>Jaw clinched, Ludwig pulled from his pocket a bright orange Zapper
and loaded it. Zoo gulped just as the others caught up.</p>
<p>&quot;Luddy! Stooooooooop!&quot; Lemmy plead, rolling his ball as
fast as he could uphill.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't make me use this!&quot; Iggy revealed from his shell a
dangerous replica firearm from the anime show 'Cowboy BoomBoom'.</p>
<p>Lemmy gasped. &quot;Iggy!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't worry. This isn't the one that can totally kill you
with real laser action, it's the toy version...Darn that means it's
useless. Crap!&quot; Iggy tossed it aside, slapping his head again.</p>
<p>Ludwig ignored them as he began to take aim. With a start, Zoo
brought the bell from it's box and held it up as his last warning.</p>
<p>&quot;Listen bro. Don't make me do this. I will ring this thing as
hard as I can and something's gonna do down! Try me!&quot;</p>
<p>Ludwig's eyebrows raised in wonderment as he kept moving forward.
&quot;Yes. I want you to! Ring it!&quot;</p>
<p>Lemmy and Iggy attempted to tackle Ludwig down but Iggy was a slim
and Lemmy not sizable in comparison. In the mad tussle they struggled
to keep him pinned or prevent one right hand with the zapper from
doing what it wanted. A shot was fired, grazing the skin of Zoo's
arm. He rung in a panic, filling the air with the hollow sounds of
the bell. Still in the process of shaking the noisemaker frantically,
the bell hologram materialized in the sky. It dropped, not music
notes, but an giant murky colored star that fell flat on top of the
dark boo and crushed him. The star then flipped upright again and
rose into the sky, blocking the moon.</p>
<p>&quot;THANK YOU FOR FREEING ME AT LAST. BWA HAHAHA,&quot; said a
voice, as if thunder itself could speak. &quot;AS YOUR REWARD, THE
WINDS THAT CREATED YOUR WORLD WILL NOW DESTROY IT!&quot;</p>
<p>Ludwig felt a severe headache as he returned to himself. &quot;OWW!
Get out of my bed! Out out out out!...Where am I?&quot;</p>
<p>Lemmy and Iggy mitigated the tugging, staring agape at what had
just spawned.</p>
<p>A wind storm to knock them all off the hill and back into the
forest. Hurricane like gales increased in intensity and spread to
cover all of the land.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Mario always wondered what his next thought would be when he
finally met his match. Would it end in death? Or something worse?
What would be the next sight upon realization that he'd failed? The
next smells? The next sensation? The next sounds?</p>
<p>He pondered because it was banjos and he <em>really</em> didn't
expect banjos. Dueling ones!</p>
<p>&quot;Dang it, Jr. You beating the poor geetar done woke him up!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't tell me what to do, partner!&quot; The playing of the
fast paced folk melody continued outside the door.</p>
<p>Mario was in a ranch styled little room painted a light salmon
color. The air was fresh and the morning sun cast warm rays though
the open window which was also near a mounted wagon wheel on the
wall. Across from the bed he laid in was a little rocking chair on a
cowhide rug. The music stopped. He sprung up when he saw the familiar
yet not face of Jr. Troopa peeking in.</p>
<p>&quot;Howdy. Glad you recovered,&quot; his odd little acquaintance
greeted. Jr. Troopa was no longer the little kid he'd quarrel with
but now a stretched out and lanky teenager with some messy brown hair
under a cowboy hat that replaced his old egg shell. And that was
weird. Well, not really. Reminders of mortality did that to Mario. He
reacted the same when he found his one string of grey hair.</p>
<p>&quot;How did I get here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A search party found ya, those real obsessive Super Mario
Maker fans I think. So rooin tootin I had to beat em off of ya really
to get ya rested up and yer business in order.&quot;</p>
<p>Mario wondered where Jr. Troopa's southern drawl came from. It
clicked that he was in one of the Mushroom Kingdom Hospital South's
facilities, the sister hospital to their Toad Town version and
located not far from Mt. Rugged, but something else was at play
here.. He pulled himself out of bed to suffer pain shooting in his
legs, arms, and back, topped off with a bit of vertigo.</p>
<p>&quot;Did I fall from a building?&quot; Mario sat on the edge and
watched his feet dangle down, doubles and triples in his vision.</p>
<p>&quot;From Bowser's airship I heard. You're still looking rough.
Vick! Get em some grub!&quot; Jr. Troopa called out the door with
some sudden authority. He turned back to Mario. &quot;Did I tell you
I'm head nurse here even though it's only been a few months? Talk
about quick promo-&quot;</p>
<p>A ptooie plant with a red spotted handkerchief around his neck
inched in the doorway. &quot;All right.. and since he's up I'll tell
em all to skip the 'hillbilly hail'.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hillbilly hail?&quot; several voices from outside the room
shouted.</p>
<p>Jr. Troopa spun around with shielding arms. &quot;Fellas!
Hoooooooold up!&quot;</p>
<p>In barged a bunch of cowboys and ranchers holding huge metal
buckets full of ice and water. It was dumped all over Mario's head,
shocking him right out of the bed and into the hallways to shiver
curled up.</p>
<p>&quot;What is wrong with you guys?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just a tradition down here. Sorry partner!&quot; Jr.
Troopa's red sneakers stopped inches from his face but there was
something else coming up in Mario's line of sight. Something worse.</p>
<p>&quot;Visitor for Mario!&quot; An intercom voice said. Right
around the corner came his brother Luigi who did a double take at his
drenched brother in his underwear only.</p>
<p>&quot;Mario?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I just got 'hillbilly hailed'!&quot; Mario cried
desperately.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Luigi's cup of tea simmered untouched while Mario's was but a few
drops left. Outside the emptied out saloon Mario could see the red
and jagged shaped Mt. Rugged on one side and agricultural mushroom
farms on the other. He had on fresh clothes and felt cozy on the
outside at least.</p>
<p>&quot;The toads are in Hotel Mario.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I've got nothing to do with that place. Baddies run it under
my name for some reason.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's temporary.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot; Luigi finally took his sip in a rather unnatural
manner.</p>
<p>&quot;Anything else to tell me? Important?&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi paused and then some life returned to him. &quot;Peach made
a call before Dark Land's lines went down. Basically she's safe for
now but we need to rescue her quick.&quot;</p>
<p>Mario reached into his pockets and his phone was still there and
operational as evidenced by his lock screen image of Peach on a
cruise ship greeting him. He'd need to give Jr. Troopa credit for not
dry cleaning it with his overalls by accident.. &quot;I didn't get
her message!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because she didn't 'call' exactly,&quot; the younger brother
explained with air quotations. &quot;It's technical stuff but she's
pinging her location just with the usual delay between crappy
outdated kingdom cell towers-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;-Giving credit where it's due they didn't even have <em>that</em>
when we arrived here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't remind me bro. Also something else. We got this guy
now.&quot; Luigi spun around.</p>
<p>The western styled doors opened and inside radiantly strode a toad
adventurer with a headlamp strapped around his head, smiling widely.
&quot;Ready for adventure!&quot;</p>

and Bowser Frenemies Forever 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Typical Saturday Morning (Chapter 10)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer: Mario and co belong to Nintendo.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Author note: The set up begins...</strong></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p>There was yelling, jesting, off-key singing, seat cushion springs
creaking from children bouncing, and spit-balls flying in the school
bus returning from Bowser Badlands, a swampy outdoorsy and more
remote area of World 8 where the official Koopa Scouts campsite was
stationed. One such kid present was special, the prince of Dark Land.
Pinned to Bowser Junior's uniform forming a colorful mosaic were all
the merit badges earned because he was simply the most skilled, the
most disciplined, and the King's son- but not exactly in that order.
Regardless he was content to mostly be like any other scout, not
really old enough yet to be more than a typical spoiled child. The
bus screeched to a halt and the game system he'd been glued to flew
out his little paws, sliding under the seat in front of him.</p>
<p>&quot;Oooh free 3DS with Smash Brothers in it and DLC and
Bayonetta's skimpy outfit!&quot; a scout a few seats ahead screeched.</p>
<p>&quot;Gimme that! Hey!&quot; Junior warned, beating his fist hard
against the seat from behind.</p>
<p>&quot;Kids, for the love of... Just settle down,&quot; the buzzy
beetle bus driver moaned as they kept driving over an unusual amount
bricks and debris in the road.</p>
<p>The boomerang bro Scoutmaster seated in the bench behind the
driver spun around towards the scouts getting more riled up by the
second, serene as he always was. &quot;Kids stay in your seats
alright? And look at that! Guess there were some storms while we were
away. Remember what we learned about weather?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The rain clouds get angry and then dance around in a
circle!&quot; a spiny scout answered.</p>
<p>&quot;Thaaaat's right! It's called a tornado. Oh and here's..&quot;
The Scoutmaster's smile faded. &quot;..Here's Scout Junior's stop
coming up.&quot;</p>
<p>After some hesitation Junior stepped off the bus with oversized
backpack strapped on. He was then left in the dust. The tyke could
see for miles around because just about everything was knocked flat.
His home for all he'd known in the last six years, Bowser's Castle
was desolated with its roof even ripped from it. All of the lava was
drained from the moat and displaced into puddles in the front lawn.
The family's old airship was lying flat on its side but still intact.
Wandering around he found everyone's possessions scattered about and
then some of his family haggardly standing around at a makeshift camp
site in the backyard. Bowser still wore a sleeping cap and had large
bags under his eyes, waddling around to face his son.</p>
<p>&quot;Junior?&quot; he sputtered, rubbing his eyes in a dazed
fashion. &quot;Was everything safe coming back?&quot;</p>
<p>Junior sprint ahead cling to his father who came to at the
physical contact. &quot;What happened daddy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Junior!? You're safe. Thank you whoever's up there. Listen
son, I woke up like this. Me and everyone else!&quot; He pointed to
his king sized bed reduced to a pile of burning rubble in one of the
lava pools. &quot;Plus Ludwig, Lemmy, and Iggy are missing. All of my
koopa troop too or maybe they ran away! Gah! I'm losing my mind!&quot;</p>
<p>Larry dragged from a hole torn in the castle a chest of items.
&quot;You're welcome folks. Pfft making me do all the-&quot;</p>
<p>Almost everyone gathered to salvage junk, Kammy a portable fan
that gently stir air around her face, Kamek had a wearable blanket
that was promptly worn, Morton found his prized half finished
thesaurus he was working on, Roy got a suspicious little bag, and
finally Wendy dug in. A second later she kicked the chest away with a
pout.</p>
<p>&quot;This is just CDs, energy drinks, and video games! And not
even my Princess Parlor ones! Daddy! He's making me mad! I didn't get
to do my face this morning. I woke up on top of a cannon ball. My
back hurts! My-&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser covered his ears, grimacing. &quot;Shut up shut up shut up!
Where's Peach? She's supposed to be in my sight all of the time!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm over here Bowser.&quot; Stoically Peach walked up, her
foot attached to a chain attached to Toadsworth attached to a weighty
black ball. &quot;First I get kidnapped then an apocalypse happens!
We didn't even get married this time to start it!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gee I wonder what terrible little thing will happen when you
do tie the knot again, ee hee hee,&quot; Kammy wondered.</p>
<p>&quot;THERE HAS TO BE A WORLD TO GET MARRIED IN FIRST!&quot;
Bowser bellowed.</p>
<p>&quot;Know what daddy? I learned survival skills in camp!&quot;
Junior snatched from some rubble old lab test tubes clearly marked
'toxic'. &quot;See, we use these to collect rain water.&quot; He held
his 3DS. &quot;And the Street Pass feature will tell others where we
are if they have a 3DS!&quot; He picked up a bottle of beer dislodged
from a cooler. &quot;And this alcohol will keep us warm!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hooooold it. I'm not sure about that.&quot; Bowser gently
removed the beverage and stored it for 'safe keeping' in his shell
and sighed. &quot;Okay. We gotta do something instead of standing
around. Kamek, can ya fly up and look around? I see that broom is
only half on fire..&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah yeah...&quot; Kamek flew up to scout the perimeter of
the castle, taking his time. He returned to Bowser. &quot;I know the
roofs gone but the walls look strong so maybe we can repair-&quot;</p>
<p>There were cracking noises then the left wall of Bowser's castle
fell over against the adjacent one causing a domino effect to ruin
the entire structure. A great dust storm covered everyone and then
the landscape truly was leveled then&hellip;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Under a red sky the party took a desert trek across the Dark Land
grounds on the way to Neo Bowser City. They traveled through a
village and found displaced land owners standing, if able, in the
midst of everything he'd owned. They eyed the royal family with
disdain the moment they were in sight and said nary a word.</p>
<p>&quot;I almost feel bad for these people,&quot; Toadsworth
whispered, sticking close to the Princess. &quot;Well, not really
Bowser but certainly folks just happening to take up residence here.&quot;</p>
<p>Peach nodded to his words without really hearing. She felt
lightheaded as she was sure everyone- even Bowser felt, but for
different reasons. What could this natural disaster mean for her
secret deal with Larry? The two hadn't a chance to rendezvous for
obvious reasons. Should she even worry about that now? Would he be
willing to do this serious thing for her? And she was only thinking
of herself. Larry would be a defector of his own kind and she might
have to shield him from retaliation somehow, not that she would be
opposed to a koopa ally in her kingdom. Her stricter and old
fashioned toad contemporaries on the other hand..</p>
<p>A call dragged her out of her thoughts.</p>
<p>&quot;Vater! Over here!&quot; A haggard and disheveled Ludwig
blocked the path with his arms stretched outward. &quot;We must not
travel this way! Might I suggest immediate retreat?&quot; he
requested. Lemmy and Iggy revealed where they were hiding from under
a pile of rubble, powdery and dusty and they held a tattered thick
book and a pocket watch respectively, begging more questions from
everyone.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm glad you're alright but what is going on? Why were you
missing all night?!&quot; Bowser couldn't help but to yell over
everyone else's chatter.</p>
<p>&quot;It is quite a story Vater! We just wanted a witness report
on my scheme and then- Well at some point I lost consciousness and
then-&quot; Ludwig's face went pale when a huge group taking up the
entire road marched their way, an eclectic group of goombas, koopas,
and other baddies holding bats and planks of wood.</p>
<p>&quot;We're aware of your ploy to drive out the poor and
disadvantaged of the land!&quot; a goomba girl with purple hair and
some facial piercings screamed through a megaphone.</p>
<p>&quot;And force us to live in your communist corrupt Neo Bowser
City instead! We the 'Dark Land Anti-Monarchy' won't stand for it
anymore!&quot; added a boomerang bro with a trench coat and trilby.</p>
<p>&quot;No! No! No!&quot; their Anti-Ma group chanted.</p>
<p>Bowser nearly staggered backwards. &quot;Now what is this? And
what the heck is 'communist' anyway?&quot;</p>
<p>Wendy keep her head down and arms crossed. &quot;Daddy I-I know
these people,&quot; she said nearly inaudibly. &quot;Raven, Jim and
some of the others? I started the 'Anti-Ma' in eighth grade when I
was just listening to people on the internet instead of reading
actual books and getting my history major-&quot; Bowser cut her off
by growling and the sound of his blood boiling. Everyone indeed
remembered that phase of hers when she wanted to stick it to the Man,
the Man being her father and brothers and just being an annoying
ironically privileged brat in general. &quot;Alright alright daddy.
I'm like not a rebel anymore for sure! I promise! I'll just 'cancel'
myself then!&quot; To her surprise that wasn't enough to dodge the
leers of her brothers.</p>
<p>&quot;Dat 'PC' culture of yours is balls,&quot; Roy grumbled.</p>
<p>Morton jumped in. &quot;Terrible. Unsatisfactory! Bullocks!&hellip;
I mean bollucks!&quot; All of the Koopalings agreed with the budding
English writer, which in turn made the Anti-Mas match volume and win
due to numbers.</p>
<p>&quot;GAH! ENOUGH! None of us did nothing to cause this ya
wierdos!&quot; Bowser declared. &quot;Why would I demolish my own
castle? So stop complaining, stop giving those crazy looks, and if
you're smart try to get out of here with us!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, put a sock in it!&quot; A pokey rebel launched a sharp
spike ball that missed Bowser by inches. Then the group collectively
rushed with their weapons drawn.</p>
<p>Everyone did an 180 and ran from where they came, even Peach and
Toadsworth. Bowser and company kept running until they were sprinting
through grass instead of red soil. The sky got bluer and the air
clearer and soon they were in a sunny field, a mushroom house and a
river in the distance. Roy craned his neck towards the largest stone
structure visible that reached into the clouds. He knew exactly where
they were. They had been driven out to the bordering fifth known
mushroom world, Sky Land!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Hey&hellip; Dude. Dude! Wake up!&hellip; Jelectro</em>?&quot;</p>
<p>The noki leaned up from his side on the hard floor. Over night he
couldn't sleep except during the last hour it seemed. The air was
cold and there there thick iron bars in his face. With a burst of
energy he sprung up to cling to them. A prision. Outside his barred
window was a white court house like building with some high rises of
various brick colors in the backdrop. Poshley Heights!</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Listen, I know you don't wanna work with someone like me
and I wish it hadn't gone like it did, but I need you back here dude.
Where are you exactly?</em>&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Working on it,&quot; Jelectro replied to Mitch's voice,
gritting his teeth and trying to ignore the sting. His personal
belongings were confiscated, his glasses, the Press's telephone he
risked so much to obtain with proof of the hospital conspiracy, and
the noki's ear plugs. Placebo or not, they helped him tackle the
discordant voices of all living things in a radius around him
funneling to him telepathically. The cacophony was too thick for him
to pick anything out of it. What a great start for a day he thought
with sarcasm quickly redacted when he picked up a coherent thought
from someone in the building. On the prision's the menu his was
favorite dish despite cannibalistic implications, 'escargot'!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&quot;I had to respond when I heard of this situation from, you
know, those blaring news sources. They are so quick with information
these days. Speaking of which, were your injuries severe? Golly!&quot;
Captain Toad examined the fresh scrapes and bruises revealed by
Mario's sleeves being rolled up in the hot weather. The plumber also
had a slight limp The three were on their way from the care
facilities, passing by prairies and expansive ranches to head to the
southern hospital. Agents sent by Peach's father were there waiting
for them as well. &quot;The inflammation's identical to what happened
to Bank Toad.&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi gave him a blank look.</p>
<p>&quot;That's why the rest of the brigade aren't with me, Mr.
Luigi. During our last treasure hunt, Bank Toad slipped off of a
cliff!&quot;</p>
<p>Mario bumped into someone. A murmuring crowd stood in the lot
outside the doors of the two story western styled edifice. He tried
to see around tall cowboy hats.</p>
<p>&quot;Watch and learn, partners!&quot; Jr. Troopa came along from
the side proudly showing off. Instead of using his staff or wings or
his ability to grow a spike, he did some sort of a rope trick. The
hospital door was slightly ajar and so he sent the rope in and caught
something big and heavy. &quot;I got em'!&quot; What ever spectacle
he was going for fell flat when out came a group of teeth clattering
toad guards, the very elite force that was supposed to be protecting
everyone.</p>
<p>&quot;Save us!&quot; the burly mushroom men squealed.</p>
<p>A parakoopa janitor named Probabilly, broom in hand, leisurely
exited the hospital and kindly propped open the door for what sounded
like a charging stampede. The Mushroom Flu patients in gowns spilled
out, red eyed and babbling endlessly about anything and everything
from significant others, to day plans (from the previous day
presumably) to the weather, repelling everyone in a panic.</p>
<p>&quot;You never signed my hat, Legendary Captain!&quot; a green
capped toad screamed heading towards Luigi. The plumber leap high in
the air and on a wagon to escape.</p>
<p>&quot;No more homework!&quot; A little bob-omb tackled Jr. Troopa
down. The guards tied up by Jr. Troopa were powerless during the
rampage.</p>
<p>Captain Toad hung on a clothes line feet dangling to avoid
conflict, unperturbed. &quot;<em>Typical Saturday morning</em> for
me...&quot;</p>
<p>Finally Mario was knocked back into the wagon. It tilted over and
his brother and the Captain came down with him. Once they got out of
the pile of tangled fabric and wooden pieces, everything got quiet.
Too quiet. The coma walk period cooled off and the sick were
completely unconscious all over the ground.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&quot;Anything else darling?&quot; Birdo stepped up to the bed
with something steaming and appetizing in a bowl. Yoshi had stayed in
bed late but was now more lazy than tired. He checked the bandage on
his nose. A little tender, but nothing to keep him in all day. He'd
need to do something eventually. The hero in him couldn't take a sick
day if he tried. He wasn't sure if that was sad or not.</p>
<p>&quot;Nah. I've been through worse,&quot; he answered his fianc&eacute;
at last.</p>
<p>The pink dinosaur sat on the edge of his hammock and rose the
spoon to his mouth. Enjoying the apple cider, Yoshi relaxed among the
native sounds of birds, other dinos outside the treehouse, and even
his companion Poochy out in the yard below before a notification
chime went off. The spoon froze.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll check just in case.&quot; Yoshi tossed the covers to
check his phone, the irritated glare from Birdo unseen. &quot;Whoa! I
gotta head over Mario's to help out. That was a group text from
Luigi. Did you hear that Peach-&quot;</p>
<p>Birdo tugged on his arm, holding him close. &quot;What about them?
Are you really going to abandon me again?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not for long.&quot; Yoshi tried to remove her hand but it
didn't budge. He then chucked to himself darkly. &quot;Listen to me
honey. You know it's my responsibility too when things go wrong,
especially with Bowser! Remember him? Big scary koopa guy?&quot;</p>
<p>Birdo sighed and faced away from him, cross a leg over the other.
&quot;How could I forget? That's my point... You bring their issues
from the Mushroom Kingdom here, hundreds of miles away to Dinosaur
land. For what? Like those plumbers need you every. Single. Time!&quot;</p>
<p>Yoshi stopped smiling. &quot;...It's not every time is it? No.
It's not. I think. Well I do hang out with them a ton but...no no
no!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm just saying dear,&quot; she started, facing him again.
Yoshi noticed her diamond ring catching the sunlight, sparkling
brightly. He made sure it did before he saved up so many dinosaur
coins to buy it for her. &quot;-that WE were going to starting
something here, right? We were even looking at cabins nicer than this
tree house of yours for when we finally... Oh forget it. Forget it
all if this is what we're going to be now. A long distance! You just
don't care!&quot; she exclaimed with a tear rolling down.</p>
<p>Not wasting a second Yoshi pulled her close comfortingly. &quot;No
no no no no no don't say things like that. I'm sorry just.. just...&quot;
Birdo kept listening to his fervent mumblings in her ear as she
embraced the dino back. Of course after a moment her irritated look
returned, again unseen by him...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&quot;-Actually I did use cowboy boots once in one of Ludwig's
forced ballets. He was kind of weird when he was younger. Are we done
now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm still better than you,&quot; Jr. Troopa replied, waving
the plumber on. &quot;Yep. I'd wreck ya.&quot;</p>
<p>Mario rolled his eyes. &quot;I forfeit. You're better at me at
square dancing. Can we move on?&quot; Tired of swatting away flies
and muggy heat, he stood up to finalize the impromptu barn house
meeting. In there were also a dozen of some curious things lined up
in open stable doors, some sort of cyborg yoshi on roller wheels with
a saddles, silver painted with sharp claws and red eyes. Each had a
short antenna on their heads. Mario inquired what were those and why
they weren't used earlier. He was told by Vick that they would have
been up and running but his phone was a Mario Galaxy Note 7 and blew
up in the heat that morning. So.. that was a thing. Anyway the plans
were to keep the patients here in the Southern hospital, lock doors
to contain them, and don't cause any trouble while he and his team
take care of business.</p>
<p>To catch up on the rest of his crew some transport waited for
Mario, a station wagon and not the all-terrain 4x4 he expected from
an adventurer like Captain Toad. When he got inside Luigi was
waiting. They went to 'Hotel Mario' with neon flickering lights
putting the natural sun to shame as their car approached the litter
filled and oily parking lot, not having improved a bit since the
nineties. Mario left the car to limp in using a cane he'd acquired
while his brother followed. Inside the lobby had old cracked paint
and plastic palm trees lining the faded carpet leading to the desk
maned by a goomba in an over sized tie. There were colorful and
blaring slot machines lining the walls trying to grab their
attention.</p>
<p>&quot;Aye! Mario and Luigi!&quot; the clerk greeted like he knew
them. He didn't. &quot;Interested in a stay? Or our other services?&quot;</p>
<p>The brothers split and Mario approached alone.</p>
<p>Goomba eyes shifted from left to right. &quot;..Jump Man, you're
looking rough. I got an import from Rogueport and it'll fix you right
up.&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi poked his head into the recreation room attached and was
shocked. The toads of Peach's castle were all at long tables with
game boards and empty plates of food from breakfast. A mini ninja
with a mic read off the numbers robotically and the toads were very
into it. He cleared his throat loudly.</p>
<p>&quot;We were just trying to raise money to fix Peach's castle!&quot;
Toadette hid her board under the table too late.</p>
<p>&quot;I repent!&quot; Buckenberry tossed his board aside
dramatically, red paper dots flung into the air. &quot;Take me with
you Luigi!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stay!&quot; Toadette snapped at him like a pet trainer.</p>
<p>&quot;How's Gold?&quot; Luigi noticed the yellow toad in their
adventures with his head down on the table resting. It was bandaged
up, but 'Ala-Gold' gave a thumbs up so it was time begrudgingly to
move on.</p>
<p>&quot;They're okay in there, just 'gaming'. Of course I'd be the
one to do your work again,&quot; Luigi whispered down the back of
Mario when they met back in the lobby. Mario was still at the desk
and in fact the goomba was still spouting out details of some product
as they were leaving.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't start anything little brother, I'd just had to turn
down twenty offers for 'essential mushroom oils' that are supposed to
cure everything.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't start what?&quot; Luigi replied icily, contrasting the
heat wave they walked into outside. &quot;You invited Bowser to the
club leading to this in the first place. Meanwhile I was out there
busting my tail tracking down Zoo Diddley all for it to mean nothing
because Bowser won! Plus today we haven't heard from Boo or Yoshi!&quot;</p>
<p>Mario stopped walking but didn't face back. &quot;How is that my
fault?! Bowser found me when I was finding Peach who shouldn't have
ran off! And those other two-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Blame everyone but yourself. You have an attachment to that
monster so just face it!&quot;</p>
<p>Kylie Koopa ran up the sidewalk waving for them. &quot;Sup,
fellas! Did I interrupt? No? Good. Bowser's goons last night tried to
give me the shake down, would ya believe? I snapped a photo and they
stole it. But I have backups, I always do, and backups of my backup-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Kylie, we're busy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right,&quot; Luigi added. His phone began going off and he
fumbled around, then Mario's did the same then Kylie's. Everyone
checked their either email or text message.</p>
<p>&quot;Re: Dr. Toadley: Toad and Daisy just discharged themselves
by coma walking?&quot; Mario read out loud.</p>
<p>&quot;And they're causing a ruckus alright!&quot; Kylie added. &quot;My
boss Steve just messaged that he's currently trapped in his car with
Toad and Daisy jumping on top of it! I'll follow you guys!&quot;</p>
<p>A remote push button fob revved up a silver Aston Mushroom car
parked on the sidewalk. She made no effort to explain where it came
from or the numerous scratches and dents on it from some altercation.
Not finding it worth it to shoo her off at this point, all of them
sped to the Mushroom Press where there was a scene in the four lane
wide streets. There were three toads in all, including their Toad
plus Daisy and a yoshi girl all over the place diverting traffic
away. Toad and Daisy stood on top of a car swinging around two broken
street signs left and right, like for an imaginary tennis game using
Steve the Bullet bill as the ball.</p>
<p>&quot;Ahhhhhhhhh!&quot; the reporter wailed as Captain Toad drove
past very gingerly to the annoyance of the Mario bros and Kylie
tailgating.</p>
<p>Mario hopped out the moving car and rolled hard. Toad and Daisy
took one glace at him and jumped off the car to make him the next
ball. It was like their scheduled rematch was right now as Mario got
whacked by the aluminum stop and yield signs. Luigi dashed out to
wrestle away the sign from Daisy but she put up a tug-o-war match
with him.</p>
<p>&quot;Enough.. digging up my backyard.. dawg!&quot; Daisy grunt
with some super strength to match.</p>
<p>&quot;Daisy it's me snap out of iiiiiit!&quot; Luigi yelled,
struggling while Mario retrained Toad.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing gets between me and my free pizza!&quot; Toad cried,
squirming out of Mario's grasp.</p>
<p>Kylie dropped next to her boss on the sidewalk. &quot;Steve! You
stayed up for sixty-four hours once when we were short staffed,
brother. You can't give up now!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just write your story,&quot; he told her softly. &quot;And
take this.&quot; Wadded up in his pocket were some scrap papers.</p>
<p>Luigi got kicked by the princess, falling on his back. Daisy rose
the sign up above like a wild crazy woman and slammed down, but
something snatched it right out of her palms. She swung empty air at
Luigi and lost her balance, careening right on top of him. 'Booigi
the Second' appeared in the spot almost like a vision, holding the
sign while smiling slyly. They then pried Toad off of Mario and
everything was looking up before Booigi forgot about the other three
patients. The two toads and yoshi girl pulled the cover off a fire
hydrant, drenching the street and sending their small bodies up into
the air, eventually landing them on the roofs of the shops lining the
road. From there the frenzied state resumed, the patients flinging
down bricks, air ducts, and more from the rooftops and down on any
pedestrians and the parked cars. Car alarms went off and realizing
they'd made things worse, Booigi disappeared.</p>
<p>Captain Toad then decided to take care of a problem no one knew
about yet. The station wagon cruising around made an abrupt U-turn to
strike two pedestrians on the sidewalk with black trench coats on.
They were launched right on Steve's car, smashing out the windows
with a mighty clash just as the Captain meant with his adroit little
plan. Their identities were revealed as a fire and hammer bro, spies
of the Koopa Troop, and they moaned in pain while the all patients
dropped unconscious again, the coma walking timing out. Luigi pulled
up from the ground with the princess in a sleeping state on his lap.
He'd not mind this in any other circumstance..</p>
<p>Soon they were back at the Toadley Clinic where the escapees
originated and the decision was made to relocate them south. The
intern thanked them repeatedly while Dr. Toadley remained silent and
only nodded. The place was torn up to sheds and the intern apologized
for that too. Toadley's work station was being held up by stacks of
books and his laptop was currently on fire. The beds were in shambles
and magazines were on the floors. Windows were covered in tape. Mario
shook the doctors hand and almost left before he spoke up.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah. Did I forget to tell you something? Yes I did. Some
Special World Hospital colleges are personally coming HERE!&quot;</p>
<p>Mario whipped around. &quot;Here? With Koopa Troop SPIES
infiltrating the city?&quot; He marched right out to Luigi, the
Captain, and Kylie waiting. &quot;Change of plans. We can't all go
after Bowser because those doctors are returning and of course the
koopa's goons will want to sabotage them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That does make sense, Mr. Mario.&quot; Captain Toad's glance
lingered on Luigi. &quot;Perhaps someone should stick behind. My car
can reach up to sixty.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why? The speed limit in the city is way less.&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi gave a start, facing Mario. &quot;You're not going to rescue
Peach?&quot;</p>
<p>Mario pulled his brother aside, away from prying eyes. &quot;I
feel like that time I was molded into a pinball shape and launched
into Bowser's Castle. If I go out now I doubt I'll be able to stomp a
single goomba.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So you think I can do this without you..&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're right about yesterday, okay? I guess I get too
focused on the big picture sometimes and by the big picture I mean-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bowser.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah..&quot; Silence lasted for a second but it felt longer.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I got your back, bro.&quot; Luigi felt much of his
bitterness ebb away, compelled to step up even if he didn't expect a
'thank you' for it later. That was just life. So they rejoined the
others and gave a quick rundown.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>&quot;Hello?..&quot; Mario chuckled at the extreme reaction he got
on the other end of the phone call, Bowser going wild and such. Kylie
was giving him a quick ride back down south. &quot;We have to keep up
our ritual! Just a reminder: you might wanna tie up any loose ends
you have real soon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't have time to chat with hairy faced freaks like you!&quot;
Bowser had lots of noise in the background like a wind tunnel with
ugly chants of 'row row row' added to it. &quot;Gotta wedding to plan
and I'm gonna invite a lot of people, even if it ain't in the
location I expected to be in. Not you though!&quot;</p>
<p>Mario wondered what he meant by that. &quot;Will you invite your
spies in the city? Hopefully not because they aren't in any shape to
travel now!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;YEAH PLUMBER!? Don't matter, it's all coming together
anyway. Here's a preview.&quot; In the background he could hear Peach
in distress from something before the line cut. How dare he! Mario
angrily tossed his phone out the window but hadn't noticed the car
had stopped and they were back down South. The phone landed in a
watering basin for moo moos and he had to fish it out.</p>
<p>Finally alone, Kylie sat in the car and checked those notes. It
was Steve's latest story based on foreign nations. Sarasaland, formed
of four vast and great lands were ruled by four generals and the
princess Daisy. With Daisy in town that would make four in charge
currently, so why did Steve's report count five currant leaders?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&quot;Because we paid a good amount for the convenience a while
back.&quot; Luigi exited from the passenger seat and went to the
front door of his house.</p>
<p>&quot;But I can go up to-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, I know, sixty. Hold on.&quot;</p>
<p>Captain Toad held on tightly to the steering wheel in a rigid
anxious state until Luigi came back out with his bag of power-ups and
motioned him to come to the backyard. There were the seven pipes
erected in the grass, each labeled 'Warp Zone'.</p>
<p>&quot;Some people decorate with bird baths, or plants, or swings.
We have a way to get places so we can save the day once a week,&quot;
Luigi explained. &quot;What do you think, Stan?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Interesting. And it's Captain Toad,&quot; he corrected
quickly. Luigi only knew his real name because they shared a night
school class years ago. Since then he'd determined he'd never be
'Stan Luke Toad' again, just The Captain. He wasn't sure why he was
so subservient to this Mario Brother so far. He was a brigade leader,
yet thinking it over again he wasn't exactly adept in the ways of war
against Bowser so perhaps he could learn something. Plus he might
find treasure maybe.</p>
<p>They took the dark path to World 8. Tumbling out of the exit pipe
they found a barren wasteland on the other side. Luigi noticed the
drooping and crumbling head that formed Bowser's Castle entrance.
That was the only part still standing. In the distance a chant of 'No
no no!' echoed. Ever farther than that it seemed like a village was
wiped clean by some event. They ran up the castle to find a very
fresh and crisp torn out notebook page nailed to a broken column of
stone.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Hello, greetings, salutations, dear visitor! We, the
family of King Bowser Koopa, the ex-masters of the land and (we hope)
your liege rulers have officially left the land forever!
Indefinitely! Permanently! We are now stationed in World 5 Sky Land
so if you are a stranded forlorn soldier please report there soon,
quickly, expediently! We could utilize you for a certainty!&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>-Your prince, Morton Koopa Jr.</em></p>
<p><em>(With different penmanship) -Also me, the para-goomba that
risked my life sending this message back and fighting off those
freakazoid Anti-Monarchy creeps. I deserve some recognition here
don't I? My name is.. Paragoomba. Sweet name right?</em>&quot;</p>
<p>Then the words faded off. Puzzled, Luigi backpedaled into the
Captain.</p>
<p>Captain Toad was stooped down at some large clawed footprints
etched into expansive swirl patterns in the soil. &quot;Golly. There
was a tornado, but something is rather unnatural about it. Regardless
it caused the exodus obviously.&quot; He stood up straight and
shrugged.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>A delivery truck fresh off of the boat that transported it there
left deep tire marks through Sirena beach until it reached Hotel
Delfino and took up three parking spots. Two sumo bros stepped
inside, one dressed like a sci-fi character with a neon green katana
and the other in a highly detailed dragon costume. Naturally large by
species, these two were ever wider and less athletic than usual
making the desk clerk pianta do a double take.</p>
<p>&quot;Brahs! The Dungeons and Koopas-Con was last week! You missed
it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Aaaactually we are here because we know about the hotttt
babes week coming up, hehe..&quot; the first brother, Sam, spoke
after sliding up his thick eye glasses.</p>
<p>The clerk in turn slid up his. It was weird how that was
contagious, like yawning. &quot;Sooo how long you want your stay? You
have your papers, brah?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I do,&quot; piped up Slam, the younger more nasally sounding
brother/dragon. He handed some over and they were most certainly not
legible. &quot;Forgive we. The darkness encroached us whilst smuggled
on that boat.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And it stank too!&quot; Sam added.</p>
<p>They got their room booked way at the top floor. Entire elevators
were hogged and many bellhops hauled lots of their prized memorabilia
for their extended stay. The brothers relished in the fact that they,
typically the mules of Bowser whenever he remembered that they owned
shipping trucks, escaped the windstorms that stirred up if the rumors
were true. They would stay here with all the money they'd saved up by
scalping vintage videogames forever and still play with friends
online. (It wasn't like they got outside anyway). They ordered
everything on the menu from room service and went to their vices, Sam
was on a console game and Slam playing a table top game against
himself. The window light got dimmer so Sam peered outdoors. People
scattered down below on the beach like ants while an unidentified
object blocked the light from the sun.</p>
<p>&quot;YOU CANNOT ESCAPE!&quot; the thunder seemed to speak.</p>
<p>The palm trees bent and twisted and dust from sand blew in the air
as hurricane like forces came from the clear sky. The building
rumbled, knocking over Slam's plastic character figures on the board.
The power cut and others screamed in the halls. A tidal wave almost
as tall as the hotel sped their way and crashed against the building
sweeping the hotel away. It wouldn't take long for the news to
spread: Disaster at paradise.</p>

<hr/>

<p>
<p>&quot;Let's
GO! Get out there! DO SOMETHING!&quot; Bowser commanded.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Scampering
around the green hills, koopa troopas frightened all toads taking
residence out, allowing the Troop to secure an entire region of Sky
Land to plunder. Many resources would be needed starting from scratch
so they worked quickly. Aerially the winged baddies soared in
clusters to reconnoiter the land. Satisfied with the group- and it
truly was more than he expected, of soldiers smart enough to read the
sign posted on his castle's crumbling front doors, Bowser returned to
the spiraling landmark tower. It rose into another portion of the
kingdom he was yet to grace with his presence. Bowser climbed inside
a puny airship for a solo trip with only himself and this thoughts of
how all his troubles were Mario's fault. Somehow it always came back
to that plumber, like a part of Mario was always with him. -A part
Bowser would like to rip out and obliterate with fire..</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Still
shuddering, Tanner lowered the basket of ice flowers and speed
flowers, now scorched flowers. He guessed it was his fault for
talking to Bowser while he was clearly in a reverie. &quot;If you
don't like these, sorry sir!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Forget
the stupid decorations. Since you're here, all status?&quot; Bowser
growled. Sulking on his throne salvaged from his old castle and in
one of the most isolated parts of the tower he could find, he was
sure his minions would get the picture. Apparently not.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Most
never showed up because they 'went south' boss,&quot; reported Sentry
11, significantly less menacing in broad daylight. &quot;But this is
a big kingdom and you got a thousand tallied.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Bowser
stomped his foot repeatedly. The brick began to crumble. &quot;Go
back to where you need to be. NOW!&quot; And they left.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>On
the tower's roof top that stopped just short of the puffy white
clouds realm, the royal honorary Koopa Troop were hanging out for
fresh air.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;So
our janitor Zoo is dead? Perished? Deceased?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Yeah,
Morton and angry mobs came around by morning blaming us,&quot; Lemmy
explained. All he needed was a flashlight to shine under his face and
a thunder effect to add the cherry on top of that haunting tale.
&quot;Aaaand we...well we had to hide and just didn't see the rest.&quot;
The rainbow haired koopaling paused and fidgeted in place, unable to
fix his gaze on anyone in particular. Without a formal meeting, he
Ludwig and Iggy silently agreed to not speak about anything. It
wasn't just to not look bad, at least they assured themselves. Ludwig
for instance insisted something 'bizarre' happened, additional
descriptors uncharacteristically escaping him, while viewing video
capture on Larry's laptop. Footage from Iggy rather, who had no
recollection of what he'd recorded from Peach's floating castle.
Lemmy had nothing to do with anything, too occupied all of yesterday
making sure their other siblings cooperated with Ludwig's scheme. It
seemed all to easy to detach himself, somewhat, from the predicament.
All connected to Zoo and his weird item they saw fleetingly before
disaster. Problem was, he was gone.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>After
the mummering happening finally registered, &quot;Listen guys! I know
it's crazy as a cracker, but it'll be alright,&quot; Lemmy concluded
with a weak smile.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Roy
pretended to not listen. He kept waving formations for the
paratroopas above to perform advance maneuvers. He was to invade the
castle with a squad Bowser selected for him, just as he begged for.
It embarrassingly took five minutes for him to realize they were
spelling out the name of his last ex girlfriend and so he yelled at
them the rest of the time. Junior was leaning on his elbows airily
looking down from the tower and watching little Bowser mooks below
move around like insects. To the six year old they'd be returning
home anytime soon. This was like an extension of Koopa Scouts,
practically the same thing! The constant moving around, sleeping
outside, people screaming, frequent injuries, and leadership
mismanagement to the extent the kindergartener could understand. He
didn't know what the big deal was. Wondering how scouting skills
could help, he tipped toed off 'secretly'.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Wendy
let her little brother live his adventure hero fantasies, ignoring
his departure. She half listened to Lemmy while leisurely rolled on
her stomach, blue eyes glued to her phone and manicured, though it
wouldn't last now that they were homeless, fingers flicking often.
Anxious she was still in the hot bench over alluding to be associated
with the group that kicked her family out of their own kingdom, she'd
been busy with something. After scrolling around she found it and got
up. &quot;Look at this, it's all over Facebook now that we left Dark
Land due to a Bowser Bomb gone wrong! Well we all know that's FAKE
NEWS so I'm going to report all of their accounts!&quot; she blared.
That got Morton, Roy, and Lemmy to turn and stare at her
dumbfoundedly.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>Ludwig,
trying to be invisible before that point, felt the pit in his stomach
threaten to become a black hole. He inched away from the situation,
at least as much as he could on that tower. He was going to go mad
over what went wrong last night. He needed <em>someone </em>for
a reality check and reluctant to admit it there was someone he could
always count on for clarity, even if a few coarse words would often
get thrown into the mix.</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>&quot;Larry,
could you assist me?&quot; Ludwig discreetly approached Larry,
another anti-social one at the moment. The fifteen year old was
listening to music then on the floor. Ludwig directed him to a
moisture faded page of his <em>'Ex
spatio obiecti specialem Lexicon'.</em>
<p>Larry
slung the headphones off with a flash of fear. &quot;W-what did I
do?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Oh,
nothing. I desire to hear your thoughts on this.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>He
sighed vexingly. &quot;Stars: Stars are celestial beings, a 'higher
authority' to aid the Mushroom Kingdom-&quot; Larry shoved the book
back into Ludwig's chest. &quot;I know this junk already. Why a
theology project now? You sneak out last night and now you want to
pick on me?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;-Excuse
me?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;We
all know you know what the flip is really going-&quot; He sighed out
again and faced the tiled floor, eyes clinched. &quot;Whatever you
know doesn't freaking matter because obviously we can't fix it. We're
homeless..&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Ludwig
leaned down. &quot;Do not say that! This is our home now, General
Larry. Chin up.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Don't
call me that,&quot; he snapped back. Larry pulled himself up. &quot;Why
did you shove your nerd book in my face anyway?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>&quot;...I
was just thinking too
much as inclined, little brother,&quot; he answered with some
intrigue masked by reservation. &quot;But are you actually studious
regarding stars? Most koopas would not be, unless you are a wierdo,
like me,&quot; Ludwig ventured. Roy and Wendy picked up the
conversation then and locked eyes with Larry, a snort of disapproval
soon following.</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>Larry's
gaze whipped from them to his eldest brother again. &quot;Me?! No
way! -Say that again and I'll slap ya! ...I just heard about that
star stuff through the grape vine. I ain't one of them hippy toad
appeasin' lame koopas. Alright?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Ludwig
shrugged. He'd ran out of stalling time and gotten nowhere. Now was
the time to catch his ride for the badge he'd rightfully earned with
the successful Mushroom Flu plot. All of this, whatever this
situation was unfolding to be, would be for naught if he did not.
Peach was still in their possession so he did it. He won? Why was it
a question?</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>He
was about to head for the stairway when he realized that's where Iggy
had set up his 'lab'. The watch salvaged from Zoo's home was
disassembled on the descending stone steps, as haphazard as expected,
multicolored wires outstretched and resembling a sort of monster
sprawled and dying. Probably. In fact he wasn't sure how such
circuitry fit in the pocket watch in the first place.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;-Luddy,
sorry! Here.&quot; Iggy suddenly some of the wires away to clear the
leftmost side.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Not,
that Iggy... Those other events. You lost all of your projects in the
castle. I am sorry.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;...What
happened back home was pretty messed up,&quot; Iggy replied in a less
squeaky and more naturalistic tone of voice. He paused his work.
Behind those thick glasses, there was a twinkle in his eye. &quot;But,
what did you really do wrong? I don't mean in hindsight, I mean, what
could we have done right? I can't get Lemmy's wrist watch out of my
head... but never mind for now.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Ludwig
pondered, leaning on the stairwell wall. The watch Lemmy likes to
drawn on his wrist as a joke, what did it mean? It was unclear as the
direction of the junk dangerously scattered on the steps. &quot;Well,
I know better than to attempt to predict you Iggy, so I must thank
you for the encouragement. I think. I've decided to leave and
register for my badge out of town. I'm about to tell Vater now.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Oh,
cool. Go ahead to Poshley Heights or whatever! It'll be alright in
the end.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Ludwig
pat him on the shoulder with a chuckle. &quot;We will see.&quot; He
stood up with renewed zeal. He would take a quick train and return
just in time for his father's wedding, hopefully with new valor.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>...</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>A
short figure with a large scarlet scarf wrapped around them tightly
inched their way over a hill. The young koopatrol stationed at the
north boarder felt on edge spotting the intruder drawing closer to
the newly erected gate. He readied his spear, the first line of
defense for the new 'Dark' Land, Sky Land. Tanner almost regretted
volunteering for the perilous duty. It was spontaneously because he
needed some distraction from the recent avalanche of problems aching
his heart. On top of the pile he hated to admit was losing his friend
Zoo. The dark boo's house was reported destroyed and his friend never
missed a day of work. Plus he was telepathic for crying out loud,
closeted or not. He would not have missed the mental 'pinging' his
friend would have surely sent if lost or hurt somewhere. So it was
pretty conclusive.. Second on the pile was whatever happened to his
latest friend, that new new toad girl minion. They occasionally had a
Mushroom Kingdomite cross over to the Dark Land side, but they were
usually enemy species feeling neglected in that toad world. This was
was different- and familiar. Familiar?</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;-What's
up?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Halt!
This kingdom belongs to King Bowser Koopa!&quot; Tanner announced, or
sputtered rather because he'd day dreamed again.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>The
person, a woman it seemed, stopped abruptly. &quot;I know. I read the
sign on the castle.&quot; She cocked her head to the side at him.
&quot;Oh, duh. Hold on..&quot; She removed a part of the scarf
forming a hood. &quot;Tanner, it's me dummy!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Tanner
slung the spear away. &quot;Emery! You're okay!&quot; They run up and
clung to each other instantly.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Bowser's
one-thousand and first soldier squeezed him harder. &quot;So glad to
be here! Yeah I shoulda said something earlier 'cause you totally was
gonna stab me and I would have been my fault and I would have felt
stupid bleeding to death but whatever! Neo Bowser City has these
weird dorks taking over so it took forever to get here. Eventually I
borrowed this car.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Oh
my God. Emery, like I'd stab you. Maybe Z- well, my other friend when
he pissed me off but not you,&quot; he regrettably pulled away some,
blushing madly under his iron helmet. &quot;Pro tip for the new guy,
let's focus before we get reported. Uh.. where's the car?&quot;
Tanner scanned around.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>A
wide bodied black colored limousine was stuck in a low hanging cloud
down the hill. His herculean strength plus her lesser but earnest
effort eventually pushed it up and over the other side for it to roll
freely and crash into the gate and then keep on going, making others
wonder where the in the world it came from. Tanner held his breath
until Emery burst into laughter. Soon he joined her, fears draining.
Some of them at least.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>...</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Yoshi
was outside in the high grass playing with Poochy and occasionally
waving to neighboring yoshis going about business. No real
conversation, he didn't really know them like that. He tossed back
and forth the stick with his pet to wind down from that last
argument. Birdo could be overbearing but her motivations made perfect
sense after he stopped being fussy. He should just stop to enjoy life
sometimes. He wasn't getting any younger.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Isn't
that right, boy?&quot; Yoshi's friend licked his face and barked
happily. &quot;Poochy! Stop! Ha!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>When
Yoshi returned 'the misses' was out. How she snuck around him he
didn't know. Funny, he never grilled her for disappearing.. A bit
deviously he let the dog in since typically his fianc&eacute;e hated
that. They were going to have to reach a consensus on that issue if
they were really going to tie the knot, among other petty ways they'd
get on each other's nerves. Yoshi knew he wasn't always the best
fianc&eacute;. He'd need to fix that maybe with another expensive
gift even better than his last one to her, her iPhone. Then she'd
come around like usual when things got heated. Speaking of which he
noticed she'd left her device on the counter and its screen was on
from a missed notification. Picking it up he caught some of the
national news on the lock screen.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Bowser
taking over Sky Land and abandoning ruined Dark Land? Isle Delfino
hit by typhoon? Mario still missing in action?&quot; The phone
slipped from his hand while he scampered around looking for things to
leave with, a hat, passes, snacks.. Poochy barked and snarled at the
door before circling around. The front door was opened and Birdo
stepped in, her attention darting to her phone on the floor unlocked.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Yoshi!&quot;
She scooped it up with a scowl. Her fianc&eacute;e's prints were all
over it she noticed.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Yoshi's
head popped up from the drawer. &quot;I didn't mean to eavesdrop
honey, but that's besides the point now. I HAVE to go.&quot; He
weaved around her before she had a chance to put up an excuse. He
grabbed his hat from the rack and his bag. It was too light. Yoshi
froze with a foot out the door.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Can't
leave Yoshi's Island without a passport, T. Yoshisaur.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Facing
out the door, he rolled his eyes. &quot;I'm coming back, soon this
time I promise.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;The
one-hundredth empty one.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>He
resisted the urge to sigh. If someone wanted to tally, how many times
had he explained to her how it works when you are a protector of the
Mushroom Kingdom? &quot;When I leave like this, it's not to hurt you.
It's just to take care of important stuff.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Stuff
more important for me, dear? I get it,&quot; she replied in monotone.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Yoshi
faced her again. &quot;No! But I can't ignore it regardless, baby.
This timing is- awful I know- but bad guys are unpredictable. It's
just gonna happen like that some times.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Birdo
kept puffing with her arms folded tightly, as if ready to blow. &quot;I
understand Mario's business is your business but, it's just not fair
to me! Look at it from my perspective. The other girls? When their
heroes leave they have support, they have each other over in that
Kingdom. You think that Princess Peach ever has to pine for Mario's
attention? But when you leave, and it's not just for the big things
you know it. You just want to hang out with that Mario for fun
sometimes, and I'm just stuck here alone. I don't have friends like
that. You are just stringing me along for arm candy. Do you really
like me?&quot; the pink dino screamed in an eruption of tears.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Her
words slapped him. Her glare sliced through him. Yoshi felt like he
was about to stagger backwards. Poochy barked protectively behind his
heels. He shook some sense back into himself. &quot;Of course I like
you honey! We're getting married! ..Right? You're over reacting
aren't you?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;When
then?&quot; she shot back. &quot;What was the date planned?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Soon,
honey. Soon.&quot; He didn't like the complex frustration brewing in
him then. There wasn't one really, just the concept of it needing to
happen. It was what you were supposed to settle and do. Yoshi had
gotten old enough, using up his younger years to help an even younger
Mario. He hated when she failed to be.. understanding with him. As if
he hadn't address most of those issues. It wasn't his fault she
didn't gel with the princesses or toadettes, or want move to the
Mushroom Kingdom together, and she was always complaining about Mario
while putting on a friendly face when they actually met. That was
especially irksome. &quot;...So, where was that pass though?&quot; he
asked, ushering the dog into a bedroom for more peace.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Birdo
creeped up to him then with a look he couldn't discern. &quot;Guess
what, you aren't getting it.&quot; After cornering him against the
bedroom door a second longer she walked off again and sat on the bed
one leg over the other, seemingly unbothered.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;We
will go over ALL of this when I'm back. I'm serious. I'll get you
something nice too. You know I'd buy an entire island for you if I
could.&quot; He began to reach for her.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Birdo
dodged his hand by shifting over on the bed. She refused to face him.
&quot;Lies lies lies again! But then here's a gift, a tiny little
bandage to heal of the bleeding open gashes in my heart! You're never
leaving again!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Calm
down, baby! The pass isn't a big deal, it's just a dumb rule thing.
I.. I don't know what else to say. I'm just sorry.&quot; In a split
decision he spun for the door again, dropping the passless travel bag
to the floor, but keeping the hat. &quot;It's just a walk,&quot; he
said exasperatedly.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Like
I believe a word for your mouth, T. Yoshisaur. You were a liar from
the start and your charm as a celebrity had me fooled. You list your
residence as the Mushroom Kingdom to evade taxes, you sneak your dog
inside and think I don't know, and you lie to your girlfriend about
marriage! Who does that? Worse yet, you lie- to yourself! I'm telling
the village leader about everything you do and then we'll see if you
care about dumb rules!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Yoshi
nearly gave himself whiplash looking back. She was on the phone as
dreaded and calling the resident village leader. He stumbled out the
treehouse and down the ladder into his yard. The coast around was
clear. If Birdo riled up the leader there could soon be a herd of
fifty or more fellow dinos after him. Most of his neighbors were
young and insular, literally. Being Mario's pal or another other
credentials of his relating to the Mushroom Kingdom would do little
to protect him. He could loose it all, his treehouse, his dog. He
needed help quick. Help like- Mario! A mile through the forest he
found a train passing through at a crossing and flutter jumped into a
musty car, landing in a pile of hay. He spat out the twigs and
examined his surroundings, old props and banners saying 'Emerald
Circus'. It must have been an off season, the cars were packed with
trampolines and props but not staff. He went into what he thought was
the most vacant car until he brushed up against something, or
someone.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;I
guess Mario sent you to hunt me down and stomp my face, Yoshi?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Still
shocked, Yoshi plopped down next to the plain clothed koopa. &quot;No
you creep. I'm.. running from my own bride.&quot; He grit his teeth.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Know
that feeling. I'm married to trouble.&quot; Doctor Professor Koopa
smiled at him. He kept holding his shoulder and had stubble spotting
the corners of his face, but was otherwise just as Friday. &quot;Aren't
you gonna ask what am I doing in here?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot;
Yoshi answered honestly.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Doctor
Professor attempted to shrug a shoulder, but winched instead. &quot;Might
as well. They say Sarasaland is a modern kingdom with a booming
medical field..&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Eldstar,&quot;
Yoshi put his palm to his face. &quot;So you and your crew can reek
havoc there?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Save
some of that indignation. The rest of the crew got caught I heard.
Oh, but then get riled up again, because they'll find a way. I mean,
we found a way from the pits we came from into the most prestigious
sparkly clean health facility of those bigot toads and even ran the
princess out. We can do anything.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>Yoshi
breathed in and then out heavily, ignoring that bait and facing the
koopa. &quot;I didn't need more on my plate but, since something placed
me here...I really shouldn't let you get a clean getaway. You may
have been a friend the princess once, but not anymore.&quot;</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>Dr.
Prof. Koopa clicked his tongue. &quot;Funny there's a line to cross
to become the dreaded 'bad guy' and now all you can think of is what
they program you 'heroes' to. I know I may have inconvenienced a few
Mushroom Flu patients yesterday but if I told you that I was doing my
job like any other for years? What if I told you decades ago I even
saved untold lives partnering with Dr. Mario when we wiped Mushroom
Flu out of Dark Land? Wanna know how it got there in the first
place?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Yoshi
could compare himself to a bear being poked, and not the ones that
would ride the tricycles this car held. &quot;Don't deflect,&quot; he
growled.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>&quot;I'm
not. You don't get it, boy. Which registers more on the scale of good
and evil? You might change your mind if I tell you something.
Something about the flu and, pertinent to you, of how heroes and
villains really work..&quot;</p>
<p>
<p>Yoshi
scowled. &quot;Who do you think you are? Tell me then. I dare you!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>The
doctor smiled again with a twinkle in his eye. &quot;As you know I
was known as Dr. Koopa to Peach as a little girl. I got shafted by
her father. Kicked to the curb. Over paranoia. I quickly became Prof.
Koopa to a young adult Bowser, obtaining all sorts of free reign to
press science further. Things were booming in Dark Land. The army was
growing, there was a large city to be built nearby. Then the Mushroom
Flu broke out. Ah. What a coincidence. Progress hit a brick wall
until, well, you know about the old good doctor's deeds. There is a
rumor to this day that they tried to kill Dark Land's budding kingdom
off back then. Who would be so heartless to attack a koopa king with
one son and a pregnant wife with their second? The new one's name was
gonna be Lemmy-&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Yoshi
felt a jolt. &quot;They would never if that's what you're-&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps
you don't really know your Mushroom Kingdom friends well! What I am
saying is as real as you are green. And red apparently-&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>Yoshi
shot up and noticed his hands shaking.. He stepped away and lashed
out by kicking a bike across the room. &quot;No! They wouldn't try to
brutally kill off the koopas if that's where you're going! They
wouldn't!&quot; He closed back in. &quot; I saw the news, you were in
a conspiracy with a Bowser baddie. You backstabbed Peach the other
day. I'm sure such a 'smart' person only gets fired from two great
gigs for a reason. You're credibility is shot so I don't care if you
swear it's real this
time!&quot;</p>

<p>Was
there an echo in the room?</p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>Doctor
Professor leisurely directed his attention out the window while high
brown grass scrolled by. With a bump, the train began to cross a
bridge over water. &quot;As someone that's worked on both sides,
one person's good is another's evil and who's right? Who tells you,
the stars?&quot;</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>It
was a feeling in the heart to know you are doing what's right. But
how do you explain such to someone without one, like the doctor at
his feet. Furthermore how to explain when he'd been missing that
feeling for a while. &quot;You just know it.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>The
koopa did a creepy little laugh. &quot;So predictable,&quot; he said
perspicaciously. &quot;Do you ever catch Mario eyeing younger, fitter
dinosaurs?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Yoshi
grabbed the koopa doctor and dragged him up to his level. &quot;You're
saying a lot of dumb things for someone with so many medical degrees.
My friends may die because of Bowser- and the role you played! And
your attitude...You abated us Friday so if our sick friends don't
make it-&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;What
will you do? Kill me?&quot; the doctor struggled to answer with his
collar snatched tight. He managed to smirk regardless. &quot;It was
never personal, at least not to you Yoshi. But ..I will admit, if
worse comes to worse, and it will, there's no cure, that's what some
of you mushroom bastards deserve and I wouldn't take it back!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Yoshi
gawked, then shoved the doctor halfway across the cabin. Hay and dust
clouded the air. Yoshi tripped on the bike he'd kicked. Getting up
something blunt whacked him in the back, an iron bike lock from the
wicked doctor. They struggled over it, Yoshi thought he felt a liquid
running down the back of his head but ignored it. Their fight went
back against the window. Outside the open window were deep gravel
filled pits. Yoshi grappled with the frailer slightly older koopa and
pried away the weapon, then raised him up again. He felt so light, or
maybe it was adrenaline. Yoshi had his wedged between him and the
open drop. This squirming repeat offender was caught at last. &quot;Cut
it out, or you'll fall if you lean to far. Though, I wouldn't cry
over it,&quot; Yoshi grumbled at last. &quot;Now what's so funny?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Nothing
much,&quot; the koopa replied, dropping his frivolous tone and
sounding neutral if calculating. &quot;Just thinking 'bout my dear
'Sweat Pea', that's Peach. About how she's doing with that Bowser guy
all helpless and such. Her castle and the secrets it held crumbling
to the ground purportedly. Her toads stranded. No where to run from
problems. Her pretty face can't keep her image spotless anymore. It
was really all about her now that I think about it. I guess I was
obsessed, heh, in a different way than her usual admirers. The rest
of you are just collateral and you will be too Yoshi once you're too
old to be of any help. We all know it's coming.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Yoshi
just let the breeze hit him, saying nothing. It his emotions were a
tank, in that moment it was empty. The doctor stopped struggling, yet
did not resist his firm grasp as they stood off.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>&quot;Listen,
tell you what,&quot; Doctor Professor said, the mockery returning in
his horse shaky voice, &quot;Let's see how ballsy you are. I'm worse
than Bowser in
your mind right now. I don't plan on changing what I do best for the
foreseeable future, and
I do hear they are still lax in what experiments they allow in other
Kingdoms. Oh,
and If I'm just so irredeemable really do something about it! I don't
mean deferring to your precious Mario, I mean YOU do something!&quot;</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>Yoshi
made his move and a second later his supporting hands were empty. He
quickly looked out the window in time to see a faded green shell
spinning as it rolled down the gravel pits. He must of- Did he just
consciously- Time seemed to slow as he saw the doctor accidentally
dislodge his shell enough to suffer a direct head smack against the
rock. Limp body continued rolling out of view. The train moved on the
flatter land and did not let up. Yoshi slid away from the window. The
rest of the trip was quiet for him. After all, the tank was still on
E.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>...</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>A
bowl of edible land snails was dropped on the table before the noki
seated alone, thinking about whatever to keep his mind busy, nursery
rhymes like 'Une Souris Verte' to that dog he and Agent N were going
to adopt back home. High barbed iron fences caged him in with the
others, hooligans and gangs, during lunch break outside, the sounds
of plastic utensils scraping against like trays filling the air.
There was a single south and north guard stationed and three barriers
separating him from a Poshley Heights shopping center with a food
cart and all. He questioned the entertainment value of this for
tourists in town.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;To
think, something worse than hospital food..&quot; Jelectro picked up
from the next table over. Nass, a shy guy, another toad, and a whomp
from Mushroom Kingdom Hospital East huddled together at one table. He
stood to join them as friendly as he could, watching them stare. In
return, he saw in them his key out.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Madam,
thank you for those directions to the information station,&quot; he
said to the elder toad, '(Mariam?)' as he'd just bothered to learn.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Her
face sparkled in recognition. &quot;Dearie! How-?!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Tourist,
remember? I kid. Still planning that getaway to Sarasaland?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>The
whomp, Dr. Terrace, sized him up and down. &quot;You're the extra
that was dragged here. He ain't one of us.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;One
of you? You are all from Dark Land, and I not,&quot; Jelectro
declared.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Nass
continued leaning on her elbow. Her black hair was limp and oily and
she would be unrecognizable if not for her designer prescription
glasses. &quot;Theodore, Doctor Professor, told you right? I don't
get why when he doesn't even tell me info sometimes,&quot; she said
with hints of bitterness. Of course to the noki it was more than a
hint. Immediately he knew it all and wished he didn't!</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;That's
rough for someone always doing those 'personal' favors for him,&quot;
piped Azul, the blue shy guy. On Nass's behalf, Mariam punched the
young man much bigger than her rather, and unfittingly for an eighty
year old.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;I
am not here to socialize. I can get us all out of here if you
listen,&quot; Jelectro explained under his breath. &quot;You Miss
Mariam, escort me out while disguised as a guard. The rest will fall
into place. I know you can, because you are not a toad at all!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>With
a poof so quick only those at the table could perceive it, the toad
became a being covered with white bed sheet like clothe. Yellow
frightened eyes and a tuft of red hair were the only distinguishing
features. &quot;H-how did you? I just wanted better job opportunities
twenty five years ago and being a toad old lady gave me that!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Nass,
Azul, and Dr. Terrace were astonished for only a moment, then it was
back to moping. Nothing excited them, they really were from Dark
Land.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Are
we all in agreement?&quot; Jelectro received only grunts. He guessed
they would just have to see it to believe it. Mariam became a toad
guard at the detective's lead, quickly enough to avoid suspicion and
walked together to the gate early.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;What's
wrong with the runt?&quot; The guard barked, right hand on a radio
for backup.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;I'm
sick,&quot; Jelectro answered feebly. The noki drooped over and puked
right on the concrete and inches away from the guards shiny black
boots. The guard reeled back along with the other two closest guards.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Get
him out of here!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Jelectro
and Mariam ran through the first gate and in the little clearance.
Ahead next gate was even taller than the rest with more guards. &quot;I
didn't know you were unwell, dearie,&quot; the duplighost whispered
with some concern.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;I
wasn't at first. It's just a bio-manipulation, disgusting but it
works,&quot; Jelectro explained, already putting the next phase into
action and directing his attention to the guards manning the office
next to the doors out. It had been a while since he'd done the next
trick he was about to do.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;-It's
Zip Toad!&quot; a guard on lookout squealed. Guards rushed out the
office and unchained the second lock to line up against the most
outer fence as the celebrity strolled by. They did this so abruptly
they left the doors to the office wide open, allowing Jelectro to
slip in and see the rows of steel lockers with confiscated items. He
told Mariam to stay with the other guards and pretend to care so they
did so.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Autograph?
Please?&quot; the warden, huddled with many others, asked Zip T.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>The
blond toad celebrity lingering around the food cart stopped and
pointed to his self. &quot;Me? Lost my pen when I outran all five of
'em MKABC or whatever health inspectors last week,&quot; he explained
in a unusual raspy tone. &quot;Especially the big ol' goomba Richard.
He was crazy. Have sometin' else for y'all! Grilled straight from my
trailer home!&quot; He grabbed a 'Boggles Dogs' from the cart, extra
stuffed with cheese and offered it to no takers. Shrugging he helped
himself only to make many of the guards watch him fall over and choke
due to eating too quickly.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Whoa!
Somebody do something! Even if I wouldn't eat his disgusting food
he's my idol!&quot; one said.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;I
don't know CPR. Any doctors in the house?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Over
there!&quot; Mariam spoke up, pointing to the MK East doctors back in
the eating court.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;We
can't let inmates.. oh whatever! Open the gates and let them!&quot;
the senior warden ordered.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>The
staff got shoved away from their tables out the gates to aid the
blonde super star sprawled out on the sidewalk turning blue all the
while. Disorientated but aware of civic duty they surrounded him just
as a flash went off. 'Zip T.' coughed and miraculously a grubby
clubba in a rain beater appeared in his place.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Oh!&quot;
Nass exclaimed, piecing it all. &quot;Someone created a sort of
illusion or ruse on this young man. Go!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Thanks
but sorry!&quot; Apologetically Mariam ran ahead with the doctors
onto the clubba's food truck. The guards realized the break and
spilled out of the jail building in vain as the truck sped down the
finely cut brick road. Jelectro was brushed aside and ignored in the
drama, all according plan. So it seemed that guy he'd rather not
think about, Mitch was right. Use the gifts Eldstar gives you.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>...</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Mere
minutes after Roy's army of one-hundred stormed the clouds above, his
soldiers were kicking out remaining mushroom retainers and lastly the
king, an old man still in slippers, this part of the kingdom
blindsided by the invasion. Two hammer bros dragged the King to Roy's
crusty feet.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Remember
when I promised to return years back? I was telling da truth! Now I
run dis joint!&quot; the koopaling laughed. Roy relaxed on the plush
red throne in the exquisite gold and checkerboard halls in peace for
all of five minutes before someone barged in.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Great
job, Roy. Everyone GO GO GO!&quot; Bowser ushered in as many minions
as could be packed inside, busily stepping all over Roy's toes with
supplies in hand and banners. Shortly they forced him off and on to
those polished floors he was just admiring.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Bowser
continued, &quot;This castle's gonna be the wedding hall. Hey, no I
want fruit punch there! You! Drop the ice sculpture here! Kamek,
you're holding the ruler upside down..&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>Disgruntled,
Roy stomped out into the clouds and down to the tower. What to do.
There was a hole in him yet again, and not like when he was trying to
sneakily fast for a weigh in at school. Just to be busy with
something he
considered DMing random girls despite trying to get his ex back for a
month straight now, or sneaking peeks at Peach who was getting fitted
for her dress in a locked room of the tower despite her not being his
type. He knew he was desperate.</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>...</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;You
like to swim right?&quot; Wendy showed off a sleeveless flowing dress
that was also flowing with water from the hose and sprinkler
attachment. It was a beach inspired, blue as the ocean with real
starfish!</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;You
don't like it? Our dear Clawdia wore this one anniversary, you know!&quot;
Kammy lectured nostalgically.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Peach
politely declined, forced to be seated on a stool. At least with the
time it took to present each outfit, she had time to think. It was
nothing super strategic about escaping admittingly, just happy
comforting thoughts. So in other words, Mario. Kammy next presented
something very vintage and regal and white with a crinoline many
times her width. Peach estimated it might be her style in oh, about
fifty more years when she was also a great great granny.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;...I'm
telling!&quot; Bowser Junior snickered right outside the door they
were in.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Larry,
crouched down at the keyhole jumped, nearly wetting himself. &quot;Shhh!&quot;
He twisted around a few times to check for others. &quot;It ain't
what you think! I gotta stop this!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Daddy's
wedding?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Larry
poked Junior's chest right between his badges. &quot;That's right! If
dad marries it's gonna suck for all of us. Us runts gotta, you know,
cooperate in this thing.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Junior
snapped his childish fingers. &quot;Like that thing people do after
their married?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Larry
went blank before his face wrinkled up. &quot;COOPERATE not
'consummate', you dirty little!... Whatever, shorty. It's good that
you're here 'cause I just thought of something&hellip; NO not that!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>The
next dress was an avant-garde piece by a foreign koopa, featuring six
arm holes, two trains, and a waste line suspended by suspenders,
detailed by flashing jewels and the pattern of a funeral home's
curtains. Peach's saving grace, the door clicked open and in came
Bowser Junior smiling cheekily.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;King
Dad wanted to take some early pictures with the bride.&quot; The six
year old reached out his arm for Peach so adorable like she almost
didn't resist.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Actually,
that's more time for us to make it perfect!&quot; Wendy dragged her
little brother out with Peach. &quot;But get her back here soon
enough, okay brat?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Junior
stuck his tongue out in return, leading Peach to the bottom of the
tower. Questioning Troop watched them but refrained from impeding. On
the ground they found a limousine waiting. Larry rolled down the
automatic window all cool like with a chauffeur hat on and all.
Toadsworth was already in the back and 'transferring him to the
mines' was the excuse Larry used to procure him.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Peach
became quietly ecstatic, taking back the attitude she had with
Junior. While trying to not look too comfortable she got in the
passenger seat with Junior crawling into the middle between them. She
thanked both profusely. There were other matters to discuss if a
koopaling, or two, really managed to rescue her but she brushed it
aside for then. Toadsworth had a concern or two or three about
Larry's help, but again she silenced it. There was a time and place,
after all the land was beautiful and vibrant if one ignored Bowser
dumping it up. Larry cruised away from the tower and they were
turning heads where ever they rolled in the grass, as there were no
streets built yet just pure lush fields. Larry increased speed as he
drove by a new fortress build site. Morton handled the blue prints
with his remarkable speed reading. One glance and he'd memorized all
the details from the size of a bolt to the slab of concrete needed.
Lemmy's lazy eye gave him double vision frequently so it made the
best choice, but it also meant he spotted two copies of Larry plainly
escaping with the princess for triple the heart rate increase and
quadruple the urgency to stop it.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Catch
that car!&quot; Lemmy blared.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Zealously
their builders including the monty mole controlling the crane
abandoned the site to give chase. A huge block of stone swung around
and into the wall newly constructed with a crash. The wall adjacent
disconnected and mounted on it were the Bowser family chests,
heirlooms and treasures. Morton dove forward just as the wall leaned
down and caught it so that it didn't crack open the centuries old
keepsakes.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Run
ahead! Expediently! Godspeed!&quot; Morton strained under the weight
as Lemmy rolled across steep hills becoming larger and more arduous
as they went. Larry repeating 'oh crap oh crap oh crap' kept on and
Peach held the coat rack to stabilize, fearing how they'd make it all
the way across the kingdom with the mob behind them and the car
struggling with the incline. Peach didn't know about motors much but
she feared that backfire every five seconds wasn't a good sign.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>...Meanwhile
Bowser had the castle's throne room decorated with tables and
arrangements about 109 percent there. That meant- the Koopa king
counted on his claws, only forty-three percent thingys to go before
he'd be happy. They installed an ice sculpture of himself and a lava
fountain across from each other. Shortly a table clothe caught fire.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Ahhg!
Why didn't I see that coming?!&quot; Bowser exclaimed.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;On
it!&quot; Tanner hurled himself on the flames to snuff it out.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Bowser
gave a thumbs up. &quot;Great! You always were the best.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Tanner
smiled back despite the pain.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Who's
gonna make me this?&quot; Bowser waved around the scrap of paper with
his measurements. Fangirl? Are you a qualified seamstress for the
King of Dark- I mean Sky Land?&quot; Bowser addressed the toad girl
who rose her hand.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Nope,
but I watched a Youtube video once!&quot; Emery held up pins and
yarn.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>The
work kept going until it started getting darker outside unnaturally
early. Bowser called all his children up and the princess to see the
work so far. While waiting things got more strange, as bad weather
rolled in. Eventually the wind could be heard howling through the
walls. Bowser stepped outdoors to find everything shady and darkened.
All wind but no precipitation. He craned his neck to see an object
that wasn't clouds blocking out the sun. &quot;The heck is with this
place?!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Right
then Roy and Wendy came running up from the tower that lead to the
cloud realm, sending up poofs with every frantic step. &quot;Daddy!
Daddy! That brat Junior didn't bring Peach back!&quot; Wendy
screamed.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;And
that lil punk Larry took the our new car!&quot; Roy said.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Bowser
whipped their way just as a thunder like voice came out of the sky.
It seemed like mumbling from a giant. Wind roaring, Bowser and
everything around were swept right off of their feet. He only caught,
&quot;...CANNOT ESCAPE!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>...Back
on the ground, Larry continued to flee from the horde as the weather,
explicitly wind but so thick it was like a mist, aggravated until he
could hardly see. Bowser Junior dropped a banana peel through the
sunroof which slipped up Lemmy and caused a small pile up. They burst
through a wooden boarder to some adjacent kingdom. Peach was
terrified but hopeful. But mostly her eyes were closed. Toadsworth in
the bench seats noticed someone's brandy in the drawer of the limo.
He took a sip, then two, then three and suddenly this was a run ride!
Now they were reaching forest with no accompanying path for the car.
That didn't stop Larry though, he'd never win backwoods drag races if
he paid attention to 'safety'. What stopped him instead was an object
causing the limousine bump off of something, hydroplane and then get
wedged in a tree tilted upwards. The car shook violently for a minute
in the mist and then it was over as they only caught a fringe of
whatever terrible storm happened. The area around them brightened up
quickly. The land was as flat and barren as Dark Land. All of
Bowser's minion's work was ruined, the fortress crumbled, the tower
was damaged heavily, and in the skies above the castle had taken a
brunt of the hit and only the foundation was left in the clouds.
Bowser himself was still flailing in the sky. He curled up
defensively until he landed somewhere in Giant Land's forest...</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Larry,
what were you doing? This is the most jerk thing you've ever..
Jerked!&hellip; I didn't mean it like that! Ugh!&quot; Red faced,
Lemmy yanked opened the door on the drivers side. The car was still
between two willow trees and all four passengers were fine, aside
from their underwear. The surviving members of Bowser's forces
surrounded them.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;You
will be going with us to find King Dad,&quot; Lemmy told them very
stern like. Wendy, Roy, and even Morton were there and not happy.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>&quot;That's
right, shrimp! March!&quot; Roy kicked Larry into the forest. Peach
and Toadsworth were detained and the surviving army marched on. They
found Bowser easily by first finding his random junk. He'd lost his
phone which was now dead, the tie he was getting fitted with, and an
extra sign saying 'this land property
of Bowser',
like a treasure map all leading to a clearance with a small crater
marking his spot.</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;WHY
WERE YOU IN A CAR WITH OUR CAPTIVES DRIVING AWAY?!&quot; Bowser
bellowed the moment he came to.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Larry
sat on his butt before an explanation that came natural to him
slipped out. &quot;I was trying to be a pimp?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Bowser
held his aching head. &quot;Report!&quot; he groaned.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Sire
we lost everything,&quot; a koopa troopa reported.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Then
Bowser spotted a part of what was going to be his new tuxedo flowing
freely in the wind. Something rung over and over in his mind, the
weird talking or voice in the clouds. No he had to have imagined it,
so back to square one. Of course&hellip; they were already in a fresh
new world to pillage&hellip;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>...</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Luigi
and Captain Toad were stopped outside the warp pipes in the back of
the Mario bros house. The plans, after some bickering, were to go to
Sky Land like Morton's note suggested until Mario texted Luigi
urgently. Instead they returned to Southern Mushroom Kingdom. The
younger brother gawked at the blacked out helicopter that had landed
in someone's unfortunate prairie, moo moos grazing around it. A
particular barn seemed like a ufo spectacle, a green glow radiating
through the windows and in between the wood paneling.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Luigi
approached it after a gulp. Inside, an X-naut PhD was adjusting a
large green tube while four other doctors were crowded at a table.
The three other doctors were a normal toad, a hammer bro, and a
goomba with Mario who spun around when Luigi came in.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Bro?
Perfect. We need all of this stuff for the cure.&quot; Mario handed
over a list. Luigi held it up and it unfolded many times until it
touched the floor. There had to have been nearly a hundred or more
ingredients on it...</span></font></font></font></p>

<p>
<p>&quot;Stardust,
Black apple, bros flower, ice flower, cake mix, carrot, cobalt shard,
coconut bomb, mango, dayzee syrup, dayzee tear..&quot; Luigi stopped
to adjust his reading glasses, not yet halfway down the list
unfolding around his feet, around Mario's two left feet, over Captain
Toad's head, out of the door..</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;The
list would be shorter if we had Dr. Mario's documentation from when
he handled this issue in Dark Land,&quot; Dr. Toad explained, simply
a red toad in a doctors coat. His stone like disposition and dry
monotone commanded respect and implied seniority compared to his
associates.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Right
then a X-naut doctor slipped off of the rounded edge of tube standing
as high as the ceiling and plummeted into a bale of hay, sending it
up in the air.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Morris!
Careful!&quot; warned the hammer brother in a tie-dye colored coat,
Dr. Topper. Meanwhile Dr. Goom, a shady goomba, was off in the corner
with eyes glued to a white board, seeming to ignore the antics on
purpose.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;What's
that crazy contraption for anyway?&quot; Luigi asked.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;To
infuse the cure I think that x-naut guy was saying.&quot; Mario
pulled his brother side to a quiet corner. &quot;About those old
notes? Don't ask how I know but Bowser has it somewhere stashed with
his other treasured items. I bet his family still has it with them
and if you could find it-&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>The
barn doors opened wide with Jr. Troopa standing in the middle.
&quot;Cavalry's here and ready 'cause of my training!&quot; Outside
were Peach's toads, a few of the southern nurses and staff
volunteering, Dr. Toadley's intern representing him, and least
expectantly to Mario's request post on the Toad Town message boards,
former MK East staff member Dave the pilot.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>The
boom boom whipped off his sunglasses stylishly. &quot;I really like
to fly helicopters. Just let me know where to go and I'll do it.
Ka-pow!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Mario
clasped his hands together. &quot;Perfect!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Luigi
silently stood back and his brother get the attention, when in the
corner of his eye he noticed a familiar yet foreign face from the
farthest reaches of the group. Their eyes locked and the person
bolted.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Buddy!
Wait!&quot; Luigi chased the boo into the middle of empty farmland
until he had to give up. He slung his hat to the ground in defeat.
One his way back he found something in the dirt, the green Bowser
racket Mario once borrowed tossed aside, paint chipped and handle
wraps frayed.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Later,
&quot;How did you get this?&quot; Mario seized the racket in
recognition, then in a sudden fit prepared to destroy it by snapping
it over his knee.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Bro,
chill out!&quot; Luigi lunged for it back and held it over his head
so Mario couldn't reach.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;...Yeah
you're right. I just don't want old memories being brought up,&quot;
Mario admitted. &quot;Well, you came back just in time.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Dr.
Goom continued the painfully dragging lecture, detailing every tidbit
of the densely scribbled on white board. &quot;The key components for
reversing the gastronomic disease Mushroom Flu are the stardust
powdering agent, the dayzee tears, cobalt shard crystal, and black
apple juice along with mystery component X-&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Which
my brother will snag for us all,&quot; Mario cut in.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>Had
Luigi not been so stunned he'd slapped Mario or ran away again. Maybe
both. If it wasn't a hole being stared in him from the crowd it was a
weak frown implying 'how could the younger brother possibly do this?'
or an eyebrow cocked quizzically. Then he tuned them out and could
only notice Mario smiling wide at him, picture perfect. Not smarmily
or to flatter, but earnest, he could tell, and perhaps coolly. As in
'I know you got this, even if they don't know that', Luigi could hear
him thinking almost. He had to do this job now, not just to stifle
doubters of his heroic capabilities but to not let Mario,
and others of course, down.</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>A
bus fetched the toads and brought them back to Peach's Castle to
estimate the damage and search the garden for dayzee tears while they
were a it. There was some talk that they'd take residence again, but
Toadette the self proclaimed castle junior manager highly doubted the
home of their kidnapped princess would be peachy. Stone riddled with
cracks, the once stunningly beautiful building was sunk down in a
dozen feet of water spurting from exposed pipes. The moat no longer
lined up and required a small jump to cross which everyone eagerly
did. In fact, Toadette was left in the dust with Alagold.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Like,
come on people! Take turns!&quot; she vented.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Let's
pick up that item while we're here,&quot; Alagold said, stumbling
aside her. The twitching he did when his item detecting skills went
off was subdued, but present.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>She
made the hop inside and splashed in puddles filled with crunching
items, tiles that had fallen from the ceiling and vases shattered.
&quot;What again?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;The
one from the stars, brah. Send Mario and folks Peach's jewel..&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Unsettled
she took the hint, remembering she was authorized to enter the
princess's bedroom on the highest floors. The princess owned gifts
said to hold the powers of the stars she knew from Mushroom College
studies and word of mouth, albeit always in a hushed fashion. Under
Peach's bed inside a shoe box like Alagold tipped her on was the most
beautiful stone she'd ever seen. Irregular shaped, it was a light
pink color that glowed in the dark room. She felt like she stared for
hours.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>...</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>At
Club 64, Kylie Koopa cracked her fingers and began to jot her
outline, settled in her favorite spot next the long fish tank that
always got her in a productive mood. The tank was drained today
however and consequently issues sprang up before she was done with
her header. Her story was old news and now the local gossip was that
Bowser jumped ship to Sky Land. It was moments like these when she
really missed Mitch. Her ex and rival always stayed on top of every
happening everywhere. She had one lead to get some info from, his so
called intern who ditched her. A dry cleaning receipt due today was
folded up in back seat of the Aston Mushroom the noki left behind,
signed 'Jeremy N' at the bottom. There was some kind of connection
obviously and even an amateur sleuth could figure where to go next.
Toad Town had one dry cleaners.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>...</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Luigi
and Captain Toad hit the warp pipe zone for Sky Land. When they
landed on the other side signs of Koopa Troop activity were as subtle
as a giant barking chain-chomp next to their ear. Under a smoke
filled haze the mushroom homes were lifeless husks. There were
discarded spears, spiny eggs, Bowser flags on fire, and a half
constructed fortress. Decidedly Luigi suggested they split up in the
ghost town. Captain Toad's attention was drawn to a whimpering noise
in the charred remains of a toad house. He tip toed inside to find a
buzzy beetle flipped on its back and squashed some heavy stones and
tarmac.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;D-d-ark...&quot;
the small creature whispered, a red streak running from his mouth.
&quot;...s-s-sta- ar...&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>The
Captain crouched down. &quot;What?&quot; He wondered what that was
about as he saw their gaze glassing over. With little trepidation, he
snatched a heavy pointed rock and put them out of their misery.
Besides that event, he found neither life nor treasure anywhere after
venturing into other nearby decaying buildings.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Luigi
dropped to his knees in tears once they met at the rendezvous. The
Captain was betting on how long a breakdown like this would take to
happen..</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;We
completely missed them! Tower's empty and the Sky Castle's gone. I
just don't get it!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Don't
get what, Mr. Luigi?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>&quot;That
Bowser could do this! What if we can't catch up and can't find his
notes? What if our friends don't make it?! What if Daisy doesn't?
What if-?&quot;</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>Captain
Toad pat his shoulder. &quot;I get it. On my crew's last visit to the
Jade Jungle caverns for an archaeological haul, I meet the most
wonderful woman. So adventurous, so spirited, lovely on the eyes, oh-
and speaking of caverns..&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Luigi
tilted his head up, eyebrows furrowing. &quot;Where are you going
with this?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Ah
right-&quot; Captain Toad focused again. &quot;I had a severe
disagreement with Bank Toad about whether it was appropriate to snap
her pictures. Think Mushroom Geographic stuff. It wasn't, and that's
how he 'slipped' off of that cliff...&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Luigi
stood up, confounded. &quot;Captain..&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>The
toad stepped back again. &quot;Listen, if something is holding you
back, you best to shake it off. Just telling you as an acquaintance I
suppose. Bowser would rip any of us limb from limb to get to who he loves,
the princess. It's vital you match his energy..&quot;</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>Luigi
pondered, glancing around him one more time before resting his gaze
again on the toad. &quot;-Let's go then. Also.. I don't want to be on
your bad side ever.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Wise
choice.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Luigi
thought he caught a genuine smile from The Captain.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>...</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Mario
patrolled for baddie activity where dusty red roads met black paved
highway, along the South to Toad Town boarder. He found no additional
signs of other enemy spies which prodded a round of applause from
witnessing town folk, yes inwardly disappointed Mario. Toadette
confirmed over phone that they successfully foraged the dayzee tears.
The flaky seeming Dave proved him wrong by flying his helicopter all
the way to the Beanbean Kingdom for the stardust and returning with
the powdery substance coating him and his vehicle. Dr. Toadley called
an old friend Prof E. Gadd inquiring of cobalt stars. Fifteen minutes
later the professor had Parakarry send over a bag of shards he was
freely gave up as surplus.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Hmm,
what about the black apples that only grow in the Overthere?&quot;
Mario thought out loud. He walked into something going on ahead of
him, a southerner at the gate meeting up with a sizable truck.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Howdy
Mr. Hero.&quot; Probabilly shook Mario's hand. &quot;This is that
help I called.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Yep.
Dat's in our scope.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Mario
snapped towards to the monty mole outside a truck he'd missed. &quot;What
is?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;The
apples! We've health inspected the Overthere before, it's just matter
of attaching our cloud-traction tires,&quot; the snifit Sebastian
said, still seated in the MKDCU's truck. &quot;Hey is my old
classmate Emery really working for Bowser now?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Mario
was suddenly lifted off his feet and cradled by a tall wiggler with
an iron like grip. &quot;Whoa! What are you doing?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Unmoved,
Wiggletron sat Mario down again. &quot;Patient's health is at
acceptable levels..&quot; he droned. &quot;He could stomp two-hundred
goombas in his state.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Watch
it!&quot; Richard, a mega goomba inside the truck, made a face.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;My
apologizes,&quot; Wiggs muttered, flushing.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;If
you guys wanna that's super. No, we're not paying you though, sorry,&quot;
Mario had to add.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Sounds
like a deal. This one's on the house just for you,&quot; the final
squad member Parabilly, twin to Probabilly except with a clean shaved
head, said from the passenger seat of the truck. Soon the MKDCU truck
sped off again, kicking up red dust in its wake.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Mario's
nerves calmed for flicker, but then the usual again. Being a shaken
can of soda, hopefully not Fungus Up though, ready to pop. Sitting
around at the hub or base and giving orders instead of being in the
center of things was as unnatural for him it would be to wear green
all the time, or yellow, or purple. No offense to lovers of those
colors! So yet again he was anxious to become occupied with
something. He decided to get out of the hot sun. Back inside the
southern hospital Mario heard disturbing banging on the doors from
the sick coma walking patents locked in rooms. The toad guards that
belonged to the Mushroom King had left them abruptly and could offer
no help. To drown it out Mario tuned into a station reporting Bowser
activity on a transistor radio. Soon Buckenberry rushed inside,
excitably jumping up and down.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;A
Toad Town spy contacted ME! Yeah, me when I claimed to be your
secretary! I hope you're not mad I fibbed about-&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;-What's
the report?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Bowser's
left Sky Land for Giant Land now.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Mario
dragged the toad across the table and into his face. &quot;My phone's
still charging in the recovery facility across the field. Room 02.
Call my brother. NOW!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Jr.
Troopa came up next with an ugly look. &quot;I don't trust Drew,&quot;
he said spontaneously.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Who?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Dr.
Toad. Never mind, it's silly.&quot; The teenager softened and hung up
his cowboy hat, once again resembling the kid Mario remembered.
&quot;Guess what else?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Mario
shot up at the sight of his dinosaur friend. His green skin seemed to
be covered in dust. &quot;Finally! Heh, girlfriend kept you in all
day?&quot; The plumber feared that was an ill timed joke by the look
on the dino's face.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Remember
Dr. Prof. Koopa?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Mario
hesitantly inched closer. &quot;Why? You have word on him?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Yoshi
nodded slowly. &quot;He was trying to escape the kingdom. I don't
think he ever will again.&quot; He plopped down on a diner bench.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;That's
one good thing out of this then..&quot; Mario trailed off before he
said something to further sour the delicate situation. &quot;Well I'm
glad to see you made the trip anyway!&quot; He smiled and sat down
across him. &quot;I guess it was a bad fight? With Birdo, not old
doctor creep I mean.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Yoshi
continued to stare at or rather through his menu. &quot;Yeah.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Mario
reached over and held Yoshi's forearm gently. &quot;I'm sorry to
hear. This time, right when we get Peach back, I'll send you off for
a much needed vacation away from us crazy folk. You and-&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>Yoshi
brought his head up suddenly. &quot;No need. Mario, she was right. At
some point during the last few years I stopped being honest about
what I want, or how I feel, or anything really, and that was unfair
to her. So now I'm here. Doing what I truly want to do with who..
or those that I want to rather..&quot;</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>...</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>A
giant para-beetle was leisurely flying in the sky when she noticed a
distinct pattern of flattened forest. It started from one direction
then made a huge circle. The winged koopa returned to the village to
warn the others, evading detection.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;I
wish I'd tagged with Luddy.&quot; Wendy pouted for the one-hundredth
time. &quot;Even his nerd talk beats this. I could be getting a
pedicure, sipping fine sparkling beverages, having a hot dinner..&quot;
Her heel got stuck in another viscous mud puddle, leaving her with a
bare foot. &quot;Daddy! I can't walk anymore with one shoe!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Bowser
yanked the old map he and his army were using away from Kamek with
ferocious growl. &quot;IT WAS UPSIDE DOWN THE ENTIRE TIME!&quot; He
spun around to the rest of his forces. His battalion had diminished
so that he could actually see all of them at once and even the hairs
of their heads, if they had any, standing up.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;I
NEED A REPORT! A REPORT RIGHT NOW!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Sentry
11 answered, &quot;There are about five-hundred of us lost in this
forest, boss.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;GAHH!&quot;
Bowser kept stomping the ground over and over. &quot;Forget this
kingdom's castle! We find the nearest civilization, take it over, and
I marry the princess!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Bowser,&quot;
Peach plead, advancing towards him as much as she could with the
chain around her leg. &quot;You have to stop! Entire kingdoms don't
get uprooted twice in a row!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;What
is your point, princess?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;YOU
are the common denominator...&quot; Bowser's soldiers standing back
watched and listened closely. &quot;What of that voice your heard in
the sky? Perhaps the stars are punishing you!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;HOLD
IT!&quot; Bowser bent to her level with a growl. &quot;Your fairy
tales and wishes and whatever aren't true! There are no stupid stars
doing stupid crap for us like you and your stupid toads like to
stupid believe! Don't bring up the Star Rod either because.. that's
different!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;But-&quot;
she tried to counter.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Bowser
turned around. &quot;Shut up Hotness. Now what?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Lemmy
and the other koopalings that had been sent ahead reappeared from
around giant tree trunks. &quot;King Dad! We found a village!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;But
it don't got no electricity,&quot; Roy added sourly.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Noooooo!&quot;
Wendy wailed.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;We
go. MARCH!&quot; Bowser's army invaded the village where small cabins
were the size of large homes to them and nicer homes the size of
mansions. The Giant Land natives were larger than even his biggest
hammer bros, but in Bowser's favor there were few living in the rural
neighborhood and whomever they encountered chose to run instead of
fight. Effectively they partitioned an area with a dozen homes and
structures as property of Bowser.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>The
Koopa King fixed his attention on what seemed to be a frequently used
storehouse with a large spacious interior. &quot;Somebody, move that
tractor out of the way. No not you Larry, you're still triple
grounded.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Somehow
Tanner got to be the lackey to climb in despite never touching such a
thing before, not even a normal car. Inside it to him was like a rust
covered but advanced alien spaceship. He pulled levers until engine
roared to life and the tractor's humongous threaded wheels rolled
backwards. &quot;Oh, I'm doing something!&hellip; Sir? Wait I can't
stop it!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Bowser
was busy scoping the place out while the koopatrol kept rolling
backwards and away. Now with the storehouse empty, he had soldiers
get to work creating provisions from scratch using the natural
materials around. Any baddie with arms and even some without relayed
planks of wood down a line of assembly. Rocky wrenches handled bolts,
thwomps, bob-ombs, and blasts from magikoopas knocked down trees and
hammer bro hammers were repurposed to be&hellip; hammers..</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Oh
dear! We cannot get married in there!&quot; Peach poked her head
inside to see the work. &quot;I am allergic to barley, and hay, and
bundles of seeds!.. And carpentry!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>The
sweat on Bowser's forehead sizzled. &quot;Hold on, Hotness. I thought
Mario was a carpenter once? Whatever, bring Toadsworth up here.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Peach
hadn't seen her old man since the failed escape and wondered why he
swayed in his steps while Emery dragged him to the storehouse. She
was sort of the elder toad's keeper now. Bowser asked him about Peach
being allergic to anything.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Of
course not, *hic*&quot; Toadsworth replied right away. &quot;Is that
a dance stage? I am the best at the waltz. Watch me!&quot; The
mushroom did a few steps and did tripped on his own toes, inebriated.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Peach
covered her face and blushed while Bowser grinned toothily. The
marriage was on again. Bursting with excitement, the Koopa King
couldn't help himself. He called and left a 'cute' little message for
his favorite plumber...</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>...</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>Taking
up a VIP space, Kylie Koopa hung outside the Toad Town Cleaners in a
limbo, watching their steam machine press white dress shirts from the
clear windows. Captivated by the inner workings of the mundane
operation, she didn't see at first someone pulling up in the spot a
lane across, a blacked out later model sports car. An orange yoshi in
a dark suit exited and paused before her Aston Mushroom with a
peculiar look. He did a sort of hand sign involving one index finger
on the right hand raised and an 'o' symbol on the left hand directed
to someone in the tall hedges. Either he was reminding the bushes
what the number ten looked like or it was an <p>arcane
gang symbol<p><span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>.
Either way Kylie hopped out quickly.</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Sorry!
Is this your spot-&quot; Kylie noticed a prick in her shoulder, the
tail end of a little dart. She felt dizzy and then blacked out...</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Next
Kylie felt the warmth of a bright light on her face. Cracking her
eyes open blinded her. She shielded her face while noticing two
figures near her.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;N,
she's waking up.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;You
don't say, Spy Guy,&quot; a matter of fact voice replied.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>The
green shy guy with camouflaging leaves on his head cut off the
overhead lamp. Kylie was on her back atop pastel colored tiled floors
with carnival music in the background.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Is
this a joke, brother?&quot; she groaned, leaning up.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;If
stealing Agent 0064's car while he was missing was a joke, then yes,&quot;
replied Agent N, the yoshi in the suit from before.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>She
blinked again. &quot;Hold on, you're the Toad Town spies and- I'm in
your base!&quot; Location: Shy Guy's Toy Box as evidenced by the
indoor train tracks and fun miniature locomotive inspired props
hanging from strings. The secret hide out was right under her nose
the entire time, she realized embarrassingly. Judging by their house
manners however, it was probably best she didn't just drop in to say
hello before. &quot;You protect Toad Town citizens right? Well I'm a
proud one and where were your agents when the Bowser freaks got the
jump on me last night? If I didn't know kung fu to fight em off-&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Busy.
Don't get it confused sister, we aren't a super hero group or a
rescue option for the clueless, we just happen to be interested in
Bowser at the moment,&quot; N replied sassily. &quot;The only reason
you're still alive right now is because you're on our approved ally
list.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Kylie
raised her hands in acquiesce. &quot;Alright, I just wanted to find
Mitch Toad and your noki detective was the last to see him!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>His
heavy eyebrows tilted further down. &quot;Jelectro Bond? Why did you
have his car?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;He
told me to dispose of it before he kidnapped and ditched me. He flew
into that MK East hospital. Anyway I thought why let the car waste?
Feels good to not use the bus for once. Why was your receipt in his
backseat?&quot; she couldn't resist adding.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Because
it's actually OUR car,&quot; the yoshi replied. &quot;And stop making
me document myself- or dox, whatever the kids say these days.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Too
late, Agent N.. or Jeremy Ninten.&quot; Kylie's hands sprung up again
when Spy Guy aimed a poison dart gun her way. &quot;No trouble, just
the truth!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Well
good for you. You've been unconscious for hours and in fact, here is
your noki.&quot; Agent N stepped aside, letting her see newly freed
jailbird Jelectro stepping up in a surreal moment. Missing his
sunglasses she could see clearly his round tanned face and beady but
cloudy eyes. He wore a numbered orange jumpsuit and still held her
office's stolen landline under his arm.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Jelectro
sneezed and dropped the phone with a clack. &quot;I know what you
want and I don't like it, mon ami!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Agent
N gave Jelectro a look Kylie couldn't discern, then diverted his
attention idly to a radar screen, arms folded. &quot;First of all,
what's that heap of junk?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Proof
that the staff of MK East were part of Bowser's conspiracy, or his
minion's conspiracy rather. Hm? Hm? I cut my vacation short, et cette
attitude amour?&quot; Jelectro slung his arm around the yoshi while
the radar was but a bright glow before them. Spy Guy notably excused
himself from the room. &quot;They may or may not be currently fleeing
to Sarasaland now.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>&quot;Duly
noted,&quot; N muttered. He turned to the noki sharply. &quot;Now
help her find
whoever else you dragged into our company's business. That's final.&quot;</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>Kylie
grinned when Jelectro's nose wrinkled at her. Later, said nose was
starting to run when he clicked his seat belt on angrily. &quot;I
think I'm catching a cold,&quot; he grumbled to the koopa reporter he
hurried along into the car belligerently. They sped along on the
streets again using N's black vehicle. &quot;...Now what? Save that
face madam, I'm only doing this so that I don't have to sleep on the
couch tonight.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;You
catch an attitude with that cold?&quot; Kylie's intentionally
uncomfortable gaze bore into him, but he never reacted. Finally she
blurted out, &quot;What ever happened to that 'ol Mitch?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;He
got hit by a bus.&quot; And that cut that conversation short.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Jelectro
stopped the car at MK East, a shell of what it was just yesterday
with only the first floor open, few patients, and fewer staff with
the newly crumbling infrastructure. Kylie left Jelectro behind to
sprint in. She saw a green spotted toad in the front waiting area, as
if she was perfectly anticipated. Wheelchair bound, a thick blanket
on his lap is where many sympathy cards lay.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Kylie,
late to the 'scoop' as always, babe,&quot; he laughed. &quot;Our
whole press found me and sent me stuff- except Jessie. Wonder why..&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Kylie
wrapped her arms around him. &quot;I'm going to punch that noki.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Why?
Ouch! Watch my broken.. everything. Anyway it's not my 'intern's'
fault. Zoo followed you to the tennis stadium but I intervened. Once
he was off your tail he must of followed me and then I was on the
road and-&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot;
She pulled back.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>&quot;But
Zoo's dead now anyway.&quot; Mitch paused reflectively. &quot;Nah,
not what you're thinking. I wish I
could do that sometimes though. Heh. But something offed him Friday
night I'm sure. Every living thing gives off energy I can feel...
Floosh, and his is gone-&quot; He sensed Jelectro walking through the
automatic doors. &quot;<p>Sure,
show up only after Kylie drags you in. If you aren't man enough to
help just walk right back out, French Boy.&quot;<p></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>Jelectro
stopped three steps in and perceivably tensed up. <p>&quot;No
apology for sending me here right before those guards stormed in and
tossed me in jail? I lost an entire day! Quel Salaud!&quot; <p><span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>He
cleared his throat and relaxed. &quot;Bonjour. Are you well?&quot; he
spoke out loud.</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>Mitch
with some difficulty showed no outward reaction. &quot;Fine just
fine.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Flushing,
Kylie glanced between them. Something had went down with the two men,
the tension near tangible in the air. That, and men in general were
just not as subtle as they thought.. &quot;Lemme cut to the chase. So
I'm here Mitch because Steve is on the mends and gave me a recent
riddle I can't quite crack. Since you specialize in getting the scoop
outside of Toad Town, what's your take on why Sarasaland got a
replacement leader all a sudden? Who is taking Daisy's place
unannounced?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Babe,
I'd figure it out but A: still waiting on that insurance claim. B-&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Kylie
sighed. &quot;There you go sittin' pretty like I knew you would. You
know what happened last time! I'm still banned from Chinese
restaurants! What's your real excuse?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;This.&quot;
Mitch calmly removed the covers and let them fall to the side. His
legs were so tightly wrapped in bandages and gauze they hardly
recognized the stumps as such.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>...</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>As
the sun set in Giant Land, the excitement of the Koopa Troop rose to
dizzying levels with the imminent union of Bowser and Peach. Minutes
before the planned marriage, two koopalings with a lost sense of time
scurried around where ever a handheld WiFi-analyzer took them, even
if it lead to a certain fortified cabin at the very edge of Bowser's
territory. 'Richard Goomba Sr. MD' was on an old sign tacked to the
high barbwire fence and one of the lower windows of the cabin had a
blue glow coming from it.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Here?&quot;
Wendy nervously played with the strings of her yellow sundress. She
knew they were time crunched cutting so close to her own dad's
wedding but she just had to catch up on some friend's social media
walls and start some drama, especially since some of them were the
same ones kicking them out of Dark Land this morning. She prodded her
brother in a black tie for an answer.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Oooh!
I'm picking up wireless internet waves, microwaves, gamma-waves,
infrared waves, light waves, somebody doing the wave- all in there!
Some party.&quot; Iggy checked a watch with a sheepish look. &quot;Also
we have like ten minutes.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Ouch!
Well I took typing classes. I can cuss out at least a few friends in
my cliques with the time we got left..&quot; Wendy and her brother
climbed through a gap in the fence. The weeds in the yard were at
waist levels and the stairs creaked when they approached the front
door. She knocked while polka music blasted inside. Then it stopped.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;WHO'S
KNOCKING ON MY DOOR?&quot; a voice bellowed. The door swung open and
a mega goomba with a dark face, bushy down turned eyebrows, bloodshot
eyes, and a black goatee filled up the entire doorway. &quot;GOSH
DARN KOOPAS BETTER GET OFF MY PROPERTY!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Screaming,
Iggy and Wendy ran for their lives. The goomba grabbed his hunters
cap and started chasing them all through the forest.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>In
the storehouse, Bowser had every one who could fit as an audience.
Some baddies even hung out in the rafters to watch the union to take
place. Bowser only wore a black cape and Peach her usual attire as
she was dragged down the aisle. The floors were littered with fire
flowers Bowser Junior chose for some reason. Junior was best man.
Morton, Roy, and Lemmy were the other groomsman, all in a line on the
little stage hastily created with blocks. They never planned for
Ludwig to be away but Lemmy held his brother's violin to represent
the military commander and Roy was videotaping the whole thing for
his return. Larry and Toadsworth were seated in the audience with no
input. Last, Kammy was the only bridesmaid because Wendy hadn't
showed up yet. She stood with a tissue constantly patting her makeup
heavy face.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Does
anyone have any objections?&quot; Kamek asked.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;I
say!&quot; Toadsworth firmly stood up.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;You
don't count.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;I
do&hellip; have an objection,&quot; Peach spoke up.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Nice
try, but no,&quot; Bowser chuckled. He thought of something according
to custom which also reminded him that he hardly knew Mushroom King,
Peach's father even though he was well known to be alive still
somewhere out there. When Bowser first started to kidnap her, he was
missing from the castle without explanation. &quot;I think I'm
suppose to formally ask your pops for your hand or something. Not
that I care about what he thinks! But I wonder what he'd say..&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;He-
It would be a no obviously,&quot; Peach fumbled to answer.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Bowser
shrugged. &quot;Just asking. Maybe we'd get along!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Peach
begged inwardly for the conversation topic to change. Her wish was
granted as Kamek returned to his book, Koopa Kingly Law XXI.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Place
your hand please,&quot; Kamek said. Bowser placed his right hand on
it and his left on Peach's so that she'd have no choice but to place
hers too. &quot;Do you take Princess Peach Toadstool as your wife?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Yes!&quot;
Bowser answered.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;And
do you take King Bowser Koopa as your husband?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Peach
clinched her eyes shut. Stars, please save her she repeated inside.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Daddy!
Heeeeeelp!&quot; Wendy screeched, running in with her brother and
expelling attention from the stage.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Richard
Sr. knocked the doors down. &quot;IS THIS A KOOPA CONVENTION? I KNEW
IT!&quot; he screamed with a mouth rivaling Bowser's.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Bowser
let go of the book. &quot;Who are you?!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Richard
Sr. MD. I used to be a village leader and now I walk out of my door
and your brats are trying to steal my internet and you koopas are
driving out my neighbors and stealing my storehouse and moving my
tractor and my barley and my hay and my seeds!?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;&hellip;
W-WHAT?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;YOU
HEARD ME! You promised to never invade Giant Land again!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Kamek
calmly recollected himself. &quot;I have been with Lord Bowser
forever and I remember no such pact.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Richard
Sr. marched up to his face. &quot;I remember you, nerd. Class of
195X. Now you're his butler?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Kamek
scoffed. &quot;Me? I run the castle practically! Plus I wooed all the
magikoopa chicks and my wand was the best!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Everyone
in the room except Kammy reeled in disgust. Peach took that
opportunity to inch backwards, then to the right, then to the left a
little, then took a step off the platform. Immediately the groomsmen
blocked her way and besides that, she was on film.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Bowser
swallowed his own vomit. &quot;YOU'RE ALL RUINING MY WEDDING!&quot;
He stomped the ground and a foot went through the weak platform,
creating sparks which hit a fire flower and ignited the stage.
Everything went red!</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>...</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Wendy
sat down on a dead log, amber hues flickering across her visage while
the lingering flames from the storehouse danced several yards away.
It was near midnight.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Lemmy
skipped over and sat beside his younger sister. He Ludwig's violin in
his lap. &quot;I guess we'd better delete that wedding footage so
Luddy doesn't see it and yell about how we can't do anything right
without him,&quot; he jest.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>She
turned and faced him, unexpectedly serious. &quot;Hip. I know Peach
is NOT a reliable source of information and is totally problematic or
whatever but... Is it really a coincidence that we're destroying
everything we touch all a sudden?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Despite
fire so close, he got a chill. &quot;Wend, what's going on isn't
normal at all!&quot; Lemmy cradled the violin closer. Temporarily
taking Ludwig's role as commander, he had so much responsibility he'd
almost forgotten he was a part of the incident involving Ludwig and
Zoo, and Iggy, or his footage on the laptop, or however it really
went. Now Ludwig was unavailable, and Iggy? He couldn't get time
alone with him, being required to manage the Koopa Troop under
scrutiny usually, and besides that Iggy gave off a silent treatment
vibe, at least when not engrossed with that dumb watch thing.
Reflexively Lemmy checked his wrist watch then to be disheartened
that he'd sweated the drawing off from yesterday. Now he'd never know
how many zeroes of minutes and seconds he been sitting on that log
stalling out his sister and suffocating from the vacuum in the air
he'd created with his own diffidence.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Boo!&quot;
went Bowser Junior, rambunctiously emerging from some tall grass
behind their shells.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Junior,
please excuse us for a second,&quot; Lemmy said. &quot;We need to
talk about grown up stuff.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;But
but daddy said to tell you all he's putting the wedding off 'a good
minute'. Wanna know something? I decorated with the fire flowers,
hehehe! And that explosion was coool! Just as I was told it would
be!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Lemmy
sighed and stood up, about to shoo him away before it hit him. &quot;Wait.
You! What?! That's not funny. Unless...&quot; The circus performer
felt his stomach drop again. They were now dealing with two defectors
in the royal household.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>...</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Mario
had a blank expression upon the fruit being placed in his lap. There
were a basket of them. &quot;You guys really went thought all that
trouble! I don't know what to say..&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Doth
not sayeth aught, we art just doing our job.&quot; Parabilly tipped
his straw hat before blinking twice.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Sebastian
gave a start. &quot;We linger'd in the Overthere too long!&quot; The
rest of the MKDCU glanced at each other in confusion.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Whatev'r.
Alloweth's receiveth out of hither. MKDCU out!&quot; Jimmy announced
with a yawn.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Mario
bolted cross county, literally, in the middle of the night. He barged
into the science barn to show the Special World doctors the items.
Their work so far was hectic with equipment sprawled everywhere and
papers scattered. He dumped it all on the only clear table as the
doctors crowded around.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Wonderful
Mario. We'll work through the night doing what we can-&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;We
will?&quot; Prof X-Naut protested.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Yes.
We. Will!&quot; Dr. Toad grumbled. &quot;But we will need Dr. Mario's
old notes detailing the last thing. Is your brother still working on
that?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>...</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Hello?
Oh hey bro...Yeah... everything is okay...going to camp in Giant Land
with The Captain...yeah he did that a couple of times...I have bug
repellant...&quot; Luigi continued conversing over the line. Mario's
call to him stretched to an hour before they knew it, taking turns
combing over every detail they'd missed in their very different
adventures today. Luigi seemed especially concerned hearing about
Yoshi, considering him one of the most grounded people he knew, not
withstanding a few understandable outbursts here or there. Mario
admitted he could see signs of trouble in paradise. No one knew he'd
been privy to one of Yoshi's and Birdo's augments when Yoshi forgot
to hang up on a call. Mario just never felt he knew how to interject,
being terrible with his words, at least in sensitive situations .
Luigi stated his arms were about to give out then, as he'd been
clinging on a phone tower for better reception the entire time. &quot;So
that's it then, big bro. Bowser better watch out tomorrow. No mercy.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Mario
laid back on his ranch bed down South, just like how the day started.
Jr. Troopa allowed him to rent the room. He'd rather be among the sea
of countrified mostly strangers than home and uncannily alone. Not
particularly tired he stared at the ceiling fan until he remembered
he had an old message to check. It was from this evening today. His
heart skipped a beat.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>'Mario,
I'm looking at my wedding venue right now. You cannot stop me this
time. Bha ha ha ha. Just. Give. Up!'</p>

<p>
<p>Ludwig
felt rejuvenated for the first time in the last twenty-four hours.
Spending the afternoon in stiff economic class benches did nothing to
take away from it. He was not one to penny pinch on the regular or
ever if given the option, but he had little recourse when he'd left
his wallet and the credit cards inside in the ruins of Bowser's
Castle. He wondered if in Sky Land his father had taken over and
claimed the kingdom's castle nestled gently in the cloudy aerial
landscape by now. Wonder grew into worry and worry towered and became
fear and then fear toppled over into crushing dread... With that he'd
successfully drained away all of the tranquility he'd built up over
the train ride. Ludwig knew he was adept at sabotaging himself out of
happiness but he was really out doing it this time.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Ludwig
rose his head from the travel pillow as a yawn escaped him. Get a
grip, the general reminded himself. He was traveling to Poshley
Heights to meet the revered 'Villain Council' by way of the Excess
Express. Now get excited already! -The way his brother Lemmy, his
secretary, might chime over his shoulder in his uniquely half
irritating half adorable way. He took an sip from his sparkling
beverage in the cup holder. They were reaching more upper scale
territory he noted. The ride was getting smoother. Indeed he had
reason to be ecstatic. This honor that would have obviously been his
years ago if 'Super Mario Maker' had not ruined his life that fateful
day. Curses to Mario and that 'undo' button shattering the dreams of
his perfect castle level... Soon Ludwig spotted out the window a
marble water fountain embedded among rows of neatly trimmed green
grass and vibrant genetically altered purple fire flowers. He was at
his destination and he couldn't wait to shed the Phantom of the Opera
like disguise he'd used to keep out of the public eye. At least it
worked well, repelling other passengers and causing the attendant to
stare at him strangely.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Perhaps
they weren't so judgmental, instead perplexed at last passenger
exiting the locomotive with their arms full. Ludwig was trying to be
generous for the family with the bags of goods, so stuffed it towered
above his tied back blue hair. Swaying back and forth and vision
hindered by the mask on his face, his foot caught a high spot on the
brick road and he dropped and busted what would have been Wendy's
sparkling water. Ludwig caught his reflection in the sizzling mess
and scowled, feeling absurd. That was why he did not 'do' generous.
Disguise free, the remainder of the time before his special
appointment he spent on himself. He explored beautiful multistory
Victorian buildings, the stores, the inns, the clubs. Oddly he never
spot buses or taxis. Some posh walker would spot a koopaling in their
midst occasionally but the zapper he carried with him would seal
their lips in a hurry. He discovered a humble library tucked away
from the touristy areas. His attention was caught by the 'EX' on a
book jutting out a corner shelf but it was no 'Ex spatio obiecti
specialem'. It was a cheesy book on exes. He chuckled dryly and then
drifted into dejectedness. Nothing a jog couldn't fix.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Sprinting
in overhead sun, Ludwig was starting to perspire as he crossed a
stone bridge leading to a granite polished city building. His moment
had arrived. He weaved between various flag poles erected. Some toad
officers allowed him into the empty halls of the building where each
step of his echoed.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;This
way Commander Ludwig Von Koopa. We apologize for the promised banquet
being canceled. What was going to be our food truck was reportedly
hijacked by the team of doctors that used to work at that Mushroom
Kingdom hospital. The one the princess use to own.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;That
is no issue.&quot; Ludwig ignored his stomach rumbling, the small
meal from the train thoroughly worked off while running all over town
to clear his mind.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;The
Council is impressed that your forces have the princess apprehended
even with your restructuring situation,&quot; the magikoopa
continued, leading Ludwig up some spiraling hardwood stairs. He
turned his head with a smirk. The koopaling tensed but his guide
moved the light conversation along, eventually escorting him to the
top floor where there was only one large imposing door ahead.
&quot;Usually those Marios would have made a move by now.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;They
are likely occupied with the Mushroom Flu problem. All according to
plan,&quot; Ludwig replied. He shook the guide's hand and that was
that, so he entered on his own. The eerily featureless wood panel
room was medium sized with a high ceiling but no furniture. In the
middle stood the Villain Counsel, magikoopas in robes of red, blue,
green, and white. They spontaneously clapped when he entered.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>The
koopaling flushed. &quot;..I don't suppose I was expected to have an
acceptance speech, was I?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;No
not at all,&quot; they assured him. A magikoopa with a long grey
goatee approached with a box containing a gold badge with a detailed
engraving of a skull and crossbones, aventurine accents in the
backdrop and a ruby in the eyes of the skull. 'Mega in ultimum
exitium villian' was etched underneath. The thing Ludwig sought for
the last five years was now in his grasp.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>And
he felt...</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>His
cursed brain was at it again. At a time he should feel triumphant and
proud a question was burning through his chest. One he might finally
be able to get to the bottom of due to being at a specific place at a
specific time.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Ludwig
glanced back up at the counsel before he could talk himself out of
it. &quot;Thank you. Very much. May I ask, does so-and-so permit
visitors?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>The
group of elders paused with some suspicion. &quot;You can find him
at...&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>...</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Ludwig's
snout was carpet burned, royally so. The sting took away from the
throb radiating from the back of his head. He resisted glaring at the
guard that bludgeoned him after his opening statement of 'We have
your daughter so answer my questions right now' was.. the wrong one.
Ludwig rose to his knees and remained there to conceal anymore hint
of fiendishness in his demeanor.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Let
me try again. I am aware I am the son of your daughter's kidnapper
but I am not here to pester you. I only have a question.&quot; Ludwig
then bowed respectfully, wary of the spears aimed at his back by
guards. Everyone knew The Mushroom King lived out of town in Poshley
Heights, but no one including himself knew that the precise location
was not in a castle but a lavishly furnished albeit hidden inn. Very
curious. &quot;A certain person worked for Bowser Castle when I was
just a small child. Though few records show this, I can testify that
he worked closely with the philanthropist Dr. Mario to alleviate my
people from the first outbreak of Mushroom Flu. Eventually he went on
his way, but I recently found that he worked in your castle before
coming to us. Why did you fire Dr. Theodore V. Koopa?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>The
Mushroom King, a hefty human with a dyed black beard, spotted
mushroom hat, and red robe sat lazily in a cushioned chair listening,
strikingly calm in the face of an adversary until the end. The
mentioning of Dr. Professor made his face harden and after a long
moment he answered, &quot;Dr. Koopa was the best in his field, very
meticulous and quick. Well spoken. Learned.&quot; He paused with a
flicker of dread. &quot;But soon I could notice insidiousness
flashing in his keen gaze before his manner returned to the state of
which I allowed him in my castle among my household, a jovial and
talented individual who happened to be a koopa. He was even a
wonderful cook! But soon enough, my suspicions were proven about ways
of your kind.&quot;</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>Ludwig
slowly rose up. &quot;So what did he do exactly?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>The
king sized him up steely. &quot;Is this much undeserved attention
inadequate for you?&quot; He sighed. &quot;The young doctor bedazzled
many with the heinous proposal that he could prove the link between
toads and humans. I caught a glimpse of his upcoming vile experiments
and knew I had to protect my family from him or anyone of
his sort. Away he went!&quot;</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>Ludwig
grinned, impishly seizing the opportunity to draw out what was now so
obvious beneath the King's clean pious surface. &quot;Of course,
King. I shudder to conceal the defects in Dr. Prof. Koopa's
character, however I can't help but to also be very appalled that you
subtly attribute such atrocities to his koopa nature and not his
isolated wickedness. Think of life from an 'enemy species'
perspective. We were only allowed full integration in the Mushroom
Kingdom a few decades ago, and in some of the more remote Mushroom
territories it is still said that those retched monstrous koopas will
kidnap you in your sleep or some such other crime. How does that make
us feel?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Koopa,&quot;
the King said sharply.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>Ludwig
stood up straight. &quot;-Free willed adult toads who thank the stars
that they're 'good' people so-called entertaining, yes, their young
children with <em>scary</em> tales
that deface us! -And we are expected to be tolerate with it lest we,
well not I as
I am not a citizen of the Mushroom Kingdom and would not wish to be,
but you get my point, be labeled as one of the 'bad' koopas. My point
is, we have a life of <em>brutality
and complexity</em>,
forced to choose between our dying Old World Koopa Kingdom ways or
assimilating into the hypocritical 'I see no species' moment and your
Mushroom citizen's customs are major component of it. Now imagine the
irony of I, a commander for Bowser, advocating the fact that not all
koopas and koopa species are soldiers of Bowser and do not deserve to
be treated as such and that you and the toads should not be allowed
to mask their prejudice under their nationalism!&quot;</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Koopa!
Get out of my sight!&quot; The King interjected violently, resembling
a venomous snake ready to strike despite what his slothful exterior
usually conveyed. Six guards closed in on the Koopaling who bit his
tongue.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Ludwig
steadied himself. &quot;My apologizes! One final question, pertaining
to the tale tales mentioned before. You see in Dark Land we actually
have a similar urban legend. They say that the real reason the Koopa
Kingdom at the time fell ill with Mushroom Flu was because... your
toads poisoned us.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>That
created a cacophony so great, Ludwig wasn't sure if a bomb had gone
off or not. He'd later rationalize something like such may have been
a better escape strategy and wouldn't have concluded with being on
the losing side of whatever happened, blacking out for a moment then
waking up tangled in his own jacket on the scorching sidewalk of the
secret passage the Villain Council tipped him on. He crawled onto his
feet and dusted himself off, the aching sensation all over eerily
similar to when he tried once and only once to crowd surf during one
of his concerts. Adrenaline still pumped through him from the raw
emotion he was able to spout and before a powerful political rival at
that... So that nagging feeling was correct. Peach's family had
secrets. Normally he would think of devious ways that could be
leveraged in the future when he was back with the Koopa Troop, but
just then the Mega Villain badge sprung to mind instead as he brushed
against it in his pocket while wandering in the streets. He'd
forgotten about it. It was all that consumed him forever it seemed
and, less than an hour after obtaining it, he'd forgotten...</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>He'd
consider the ramifications of such after he stopped wandering around.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Trying
to find a point of reference in the surprisingly massive city, Ludwig
noticed he had unchecked messages on his phone, his backup one
rather, since the first was lost somewhere in Toad Town.. It was a
roaming one way message from a tower labeled 'WW63195x'</p>

<p>&quot;BZZT-Hey.
This this on? Listen, you koopas will get enough of taking over my
land and stepping on my property. I can't wait 'till you're gone. My
shed that your father used as a marriage hall burned down and you are
ALL playing for it! FYI I'm doing this favor for ya, firing up my old
radio tower that sucks up all the electricity because some brat,
Larry I think, paid me gold coins. Think it was supposed to be
secret. Now his message to you, punk: something big attacked Sky Land
and your shipping truck slaves got washed away at Isle Delfino.
Bowser is now in Giant Land, my home, where they DON'T belong!&quot;
<p>The
message terminated.</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>Ludwig's
head was spinning still when he found the library again. He lunged in
for local newspaper up front and emitted a loud exclamation skimming
the topic of Sky Land being victim of that 'Bowser Bomb gone wrong'.
The editors noted that that explanation was starting to seem less
accurate when Isle Delfino reported the same unnatural sky phenomenon
and yet had no weapon sightings. This occurred all yesterday for a
greater shock to Ludwig. On autopilot he found a cab waiting the
library's curb and got inside the late model sedan. &quot;Take me to
the Mushroom Kingdom!&quot; he ordered, and it drove off, the
koopaling never recalling that Poshley Heights wasn't supposed to
have a taxi service.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>...</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Secretary
Ming of the Chai Kingdom, a short roketon scurried on foot to the
backside of Daisy's castle, now home of a two-hundred foot deep
trench excavated by servants in a mad treasure rush. Daisy's dozens
of hired hands, paid workers and not volunteers as Sarsaland had no
toads to be toady, kept digging in a perpetual motion, not responding
to Ming's calls. If he needed proof they'd gone insane, he had it. He
would normally request help from the other generals, Yura, Roar, and
Tao, but since their temporary replacement 'General S&#464;w&aacute;ng'
entered the scene he couldn't get them to do anything but drool,
sometimes literally.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Accustomed
to being ignored he returned to Daisy's castle and his office when
someone knocking on the front bamboo doors forced him back to the
front. Eagerly he swung it open and there were three haggard looked
individuals, a whomp, a toad, and a shy guy.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;N&#464;m&eacute;n
h&#462;o?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Why
you just standing there? You need doctors don't you?&quot; Dr.
Terrace spoke up.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;MKDCU?!
No!&quot; Ming shook his head, flashbacks of that time Daisy only had
the mildest sinus infection playing in his mind. That group flipped
the entire castle upside down.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Nass
T. nudged the whomp to shut him up. &quot;I'm nurse Nass Toad, head
nurse of Isle Falsa and this is my crew. We are not invasive- unless
we need to be. You've never heard of it? Here's our representative.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>A
fourth person revealed themselves from the side and it was a
Sarasaland boarder officer that smelled about as bad as the other
three. &quot;Daisy approved of us- I mean them some time ago.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Ah.
Go go. But not there!&quot; Ming dragged them all inside and away
from an ajar door he'd only then noticed. Officially hiring
additional help was perhaps the most authoritative thing he'd been
allowed to do in a while. He could continue the trend by being extra
responsible and figuring out who meddled with that door.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Inside
that room Ming could see a red led clock on the wall blinking
'00:00'. He flipped a switch, illuminating the storage room with
Daisy's still new vanity that didn't match the color of her room, a
present box from the Crystal King, and a punching bag, also a dusty
key rack labeled 'Weapon Storage' with the sliding card key missing.
Ming kept the keys to the actual switches for their artillery so why
would only the card be missing?</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>...</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Mario
sprung out of bed at the sound of banjos, not wanting to be ice
bucketed. &quot;I'm awake!&quot; He sighed in relief and then dropped
back under the covers for a few more minutes of rest, unsure when
he'd ever dozed off. Thank Eldstar it was only the radio alarm this
time.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Soon
a group gathered at the barn to meet the doctors. The lab was
somewhat cleaned up from last night to be presentable and
demonstrative. Tables were filled with test tubes on racks, a green
liquid bubbling fiercely with in. The capsule what occupied the back
left corner of the barn had grown a posy of red and yellow wires
since yesterday, looking ever more completed yet dangerous. The white
boards were etched on from top to bottom in various formulas and
notes in various handwriting.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;We've
compiled it the way Dr. Mario would have. I totally met him one time
and he loved my work,&quot; Professor X-naut boasted smugly.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;He
was such a great guy to help the old Koopa Kingdom back then. What
does he do now aside from the Smash brothers thing?&quot; Dr. Topper
wondered out loud.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Why
do you need to know?&quot; Jr. Troopa countered.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;It
doesn't matter, associates. All of our work will mean nothing if
don't have his notes..&quot; Dr. Toad crossed his arms, the most
gaunt of the doctors.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Meanwhile
there was some whispering from the back of the pack. There were a
slew of uninvited attempting to take peeks in the barn, precisely
where Yoshi was chaperoning. A bumpty in a lumpy wintry coat and a
lined fur hat waddled out the doors while writing something down on a
yellow legal pad. Yoshi kept on his heels, hunching down to blend in
with the green corn stalks. The bumpty froze skittishly after stalk
was snapped.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Stop!&quot;
the dino yelled. He scared away the goonies nearby. The bumpty ran
and five steps later was smacked in the back of the head with a
spotted yoshi egg, making him eat a mouthful of soil.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Shortly
after, &quot;Why were you listening in on us, huh, baddie?&quot;
Mario planted himself face to face with the shivering penguin chained
to the wall of the old western prison cell. The entire village
seemingly gathered around at their wall of Koopa Troop spies, the
bumpty and the two koopas held since yesterday. Shy Guy ranchers
riding ostros were tutting to and fro spreading the news like a
wildfire.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;This
was on him.&quot; Yoshi shook the jacket and a plethora of little
things flung out of it, keys, sticks of gum, coins, breath mints, a
suspicious radio, and notes.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>One
of the papers being scattered around brushed Buckenberry's shoe. The
young helper of Mario caught it. &quot;Let me get Toadette.&quot;
Toadette had been moving back and forth from here to Peach's castle
with the other toads all morning to manage their clean up effort. She
texted him back instantly saying it's Koopanese and that it was a
rough translation of the science formulas from the white boards.
Buckenberry relayed that info, sending a shock wave through the
crowd. Professor X-naut broke from the crowd to lock the doors on the
barn with a heavy old bolt.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;I
knew those blasted computers would do it one day!&quot; the x-naut
exclaimed wildly.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Dr.
Toad groaned, &quot;Morris, he didn't use a computer to steal our
notes! Just his eyes.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Dr.
Goom added, &quot;And if we actually used the PCs as I proposed to
contain our notes, this wouldn't have happened.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;You
know darn well one of us would have flushed a flash drive down the
toilet, or done something else to screw it up!&quot; Dr. Topper
teased.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Momma
mia!&quot; Mario exclaimed. &quot;Focus everyone. We'll just put he
bad guys in the- Hey are you listening?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;-We
got a spot on Mt. Rugged where there's this big 'ol overhang and we
dangle criminals over the canyon and whack'em with sticks,&quot; Vick
said, one of many hospital staff lingering around for drama. &quot;The
kids used to be all over it like 'lemme whack 'em pard!' Think
that'll work?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;I
remember that.&quot; Jr. Troopa nodded. &quot;But, nah. Too much set
up. I mean I could totally lift those iron bars if I had to but it's
been a long day. Yep. I'm definitely didn't sprang something the
other day because I didn't have a spotter for my dumbbell set. No
siree!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Blast
you, Junior,&quot; the patooie plant shot back. &quot;We can use the
Mecha-yoshis then, pard. They ain't gonna glitch I promise.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;We
ain't saying nothing!&quot; The hammer bro Bowser spy said.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;We
don't know nothing either!&quot; the other added.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>A
small white boo with a black ten gallon hat and a red bandanna over
their mouth appeared on the scene with a cool 'whoosh' effect. Mario,
forgotten about by then, saw trouble a mile away. The boo's
expression was passive but something about them silenced everyone
they crossed. Soon all eyes were on the boo diddly.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Watch
this,&quot; they said, low gritty like. &quot;You wanna see someone
talk? I can make them.&quot; The boo spun to the prisoners and back
again to the crowd, gaining a smirk that twisted into something more
cruel. &quot;By the power of Eldstar!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>With
a clap of thunder out of place for the sunny sky, a bolt of lightning
came down and struck the spies with a bright flash. Spectators
uncovered their faces. All three were burnt badly, the bird without a
protective shell taking the brunt of it and turning completely crisp.
Witnesses gawked before it became rousing praise around the morbid
sight, half out of wonder, half of fear.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>The
spectacle became more intense when the two koopa spies had barely
survived after all. Desperately they scurried through the crowd and
into the prairies. Vick whistled and engines revved up from a stable
nearby. Cyborg dinosaurs knocked the doors down with their squeaky
wheels and tracked the trail of the escapees. Mario heard a shrill
zapping noise. Wheat stalks began to fly up from an isolated spot in
the field, then another. Lasers were being shot, fires were starting,
people were panicking, ranchers were carrying water buckets and
everything became chaotic in the rural square.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;TriggerHappy
McBoo, we
need to talk,&quot; Mario said, calmly tapping the fiend from behind.</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>The
boo diddly spun to him, nodded once and vanished.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>...</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>A
blanket of dew covered the ground and insects buzzed. The air was
clear and new grass sprout under the ashes of Bowser's storehouse
fiasco from last night. Warm rays were broken up by the canopy while
Peach planted herself in the fragmented light. She had this solitude
because of an emergency family meeting being held off somewhere. At
this point, she dropped pretending to be imperturbable and she didn't
want Toadsworth to see her so unprincess like. She was longing for
Mario now. Despite her being the native and him the foreigner, it was
he that anchored her, so lost in her own world before. Furthermore
she was plain frustrated, witnessing Bowser's forces botch the
execution everything from the sleeping routines to the bathroom
situation made her want to scream. She would have if far enough away
from camp. She returned before that creepy Sentry #11 watchdog could
rat on her and sat at the camp fire indignantly. She almost
discreetly made a call to her father, no one seeming to realize she
clearly had a working cellphone with battery, to let him know she was
okay. Eventually she decided against. Something had changed from two
days ago when she so eagerly extended her affairs to him for support.
Now it felt like she needed to get though a problem on her own for
once.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Deep
lines in his face, Bowser plopped down on a stump, far enough he
thought for privacy with the family. &quot;A bunch of ya'll wanted to
discuss some things, so let's do it.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Larry
and Junior are both trying to sabotage your plans,&quot; Lemmy
tattled. &quot;Together even!&quot; He felt he was almost becoming
Ludwig, a nightmarish realization, and he would have to get on a
trampoline some time and dance to techno to gain his old jive again.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;I
know. Larry is grounded forever. What else?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Junior
doesn't get a punishment?!&quot; Larry blared.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Bowser
sheepishly spun to him in the far rear. &quot;Oooh yeah him too. Got
thrown off for a second. Junior rarely misbehaves. Next?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;I
got something to say. King Dad, I'm getting annoyed that you don't
let me do nothing!&quot; Roy said. &quot;Dis kingdom or any of 'em
coulda been in the bag if you'd lend me half da army!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;How
are you gonna do that when I don't even have enough minions to keep
the outhouse's toilet tissue stocked? Huh?&quot; Bowser barked back.
&quot;What did you really have to ask?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Roy
paused for a long time before leaning back against a tree 'cooly' and
turning his head. &quot;Nothin'...&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Morton
closed shut the diary his face was buried in moments before. &quot;May
I mention that I have a startling discovery like when I found
Junior's missing pet chomp by reading every morning newspaper for a
week until that one koopa reported Mr. Chomper as lost? Zheng Koopa
was a quizzical author and explorer and his life parallels ours.
Remember when I was in the book club that was down the block, not to
the left where someone stole my wallet, but to the right where I
found a one-hundred coin bill? Long story short, I received this book
and would you know, the exact terrors of Zheng are our own? He was
stalked relentlessly, King Dad and us too! What tragedy, calamity,
disaster will happen next? An earthquake? A bomb?-!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Morton!&quot;
Bowser shook him out of the daze. &quot;Last I checked we ain't him
so it's fine! This isn't the first natural disaster and we're not the
first kingdom relocate a few times either! Those mythical old stories
don't make sense, so get your freaking heads on straight!&quot; He
stooped to one of his sons in particular. &quot;I haven't had any
trouble out of you the whole time now that I think about it. He's now
y'all's role model.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Iggy
kept tinkering with his watch project. Progressing ever closer to
competition, no one knowing what that might entail but Iggy himself,
the wires from it were tamed and the watch face could open to reveal
circuitry. It would almost seem he was detached from reality utterly
but he did a quick thumbs up letting them know that he was only
slightly detached, his normal.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Lemmy
rose his hand. &quot;King Dad, I agree! He shows the true Koopa Troop
spirit, resilience, fearlessness, and he loves being mean!&quot; He
glanced over to his 'twin' who did not even acknowledge the comment.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Wendy
had a stank face him that became into a cute little pout when Bowser
turned his head. Lemmy wanted reprimand her for being unctuous but
was cut off- &quot;Me too daddy, don't I? I got everyone flagged for
the fake articles. And and- oh let's forget about rebuilding here and
just move over to Water Land. Peach might warm up to it since it's
not filled with disgusting bugs and crazy people and etc,&quot; the
koopaling princess explained, nervously playing around with her gold
bracelets.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Bowser
stood up from Iggy. &quot;That's&hellip; not stupid!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;But
daddy! I don't want more brothers and sisters!&quot; Junior whined,
stomping his feet in miniature imitation of his father.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Bowser
picked up and cradled the six year old. &quot;Aww, that's all you're
worried about? Don't son! (Anytime soon at least..) Okay? Now we know
the plans so let's get back!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Larry
watched them leave. He miserably kicked a rock so hard his foot
stung. The oblong pebble skipped across Iggy's feet, the older
brother ignoring such.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Larry
sat next to him on the fallen log and sighed. &quot;Iggy. Do you want
dad to marry Peach?... Bro, listen to me!&quot; Larry waved a hand in
his face. &quot;If you're now out here ballin' as they flippin' role
model or whatever like that makes you an enemy to me now 'cause they
ain't getting married not on my watch! Ya feel me?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Iggy
turned to him. &quot;Would a gearmo and a X-Yux ever go on a date?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;...I
can't control that?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Correct.
You can't control things in life sometimes.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>One
by one droplets rolled off of Larry's cheeks and pattered on the
woody forest floor, all of the tears he'd held in since yesterday and
frankly even longer. He shook trying to hold them back in vain.
&quot;Dude! Shut up! This could mean my future right now and.. and no
one gets it!&quot; He sighed heavily. &quot;Ya probably think I'm
just trying to be an annoying brat but it's not like that! I actually
want dad and all of us really to be happy for once. Dad thinks he
wants Peach. I've really spoken to her now and she's actually cool,
but they wouldn't be a match. I think dad like, just likes the ideal
of having her, you know? And all of us are conditioned to be yes men
to dad's stupid plans so that this thing never ends. We could really
be doing something other than kidnapping princesses. I paid attention
in school. There's no real reason why we need to do that. It ain't
medieval times..&quot; He turned to his brother. &quot;Like, Iggster,
don't you wanna be rich? The amazing junk you build all the time
could do that. All we do in the Troop is break it cause we're stupid
or leave it forgotten in the basement because it doesn't destroy
plumbers good enough. And personally I wanna be a.. forget it. I
missed my chance wasting time pretending to be something I'm not!&quot;
He squeezed his eyes shut. &quot;It's all freaking stupid! I'll be
stuck here forever as a loser!&quot; Larry was jolted by someone
patting him on the shell.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;You
didn't let me finish Larry-chan,&quot; Iggy said soothingly as he
could. &quot;As the anime Cowboy BoomBoom teaches, if the universe
doesn't want something to happen, you punch the universe in the face.
-Okay maybe that is not perfectly applicable but I have translated
all scientific principles from that totally realistic fan favorite
show that was appropriate to my project, and some not appropriate,
but this invention when completed might prove if since the universe
is really really old, to put it in laymen's terms, it may or may not
be malleable by minuscule entities like us. Such will be definitively
determined if I prevent what happened on the hill Friday!&quot; he
declared, voice steadily raising to a exuberant shout.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Larry
sniffled his nose and nodding to whatever that babble was, Iggy's
energy contagious. &quot;Now you really got me tripping. What are you
talking about? In English!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Iggy's
wide smile waned. &quot;...You confided in me so let me be 'straight'
with you as you'd put it.&quot; He sat the invention back into his
lap and paused with foreign sobriety. &quot;Two nights ago...&quot;
he abridged the tale of Friday, &quot;and long story short, Zoo had
an item that a Dark Star spawned from. It attacked that night and it
only logically makes sense it attacked Sam and Slam and us again at
Sky Land. I guess King Dad shuffling us around like Morton's broken
iPod is good actually because we can dodge it if we're quick enough.
I know we totally can't keep running forever, like a season of a
great series.. Sorry sorry,&quot; Iggy went, catching himself. &quot;So
I'm going to try to fix that night.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Larry
picked his jaw off the ground as it set in. Anguishing, and he then
buried his face in his palms. &quot;Even if we have to move around we
could have went over this crap back home! We could be traveling
around in an organized fashion, not this hot steam'n mess!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Iggy
quickly draped his arm around him. &quot;It's okay. Reason with me, I
was not sure about the attack pattern until now and I'm close to
completion so it may not matter! Even if I knew immediately at the
outset when we had our full Troop, imagine the chaos. It's like
opposite day with us sometimes, we would have killed each other
infighting before the dark star did it. One of the top Dark Land
professors once said advancement is a slow process and the direction
not clear until it smacks you in the face. Or maybe Kammy said that
when she forgot her glasses.. Anyway, you can't go from zero to
160,495.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Larry
said after a pause, &quot;A car that fast would be pimpin'.&quot; He
smiled at his genius older brother cheekily. &quot;But I get it. I
guess it's easy to mouth off 'bout what we coulda shoulda in
hindsight so don't get too twisted over it.&quot; Larry got off the
log and crossed his arms. &quot;And thank you for being real with me.
I, I really appreciate that. Do I want to know where that oddly
specific number came from?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;The
theoretical max velocity of my rocket prototype I was working on
before our castle combusted irreparably. It would have impressed all
of the attractive females and Lemmy had already promised to test it
for me with that giant circus helmet he has..&quot; Immediately that
name sparked something them both. Iggy regretted it.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>Larry
began to look peeved all over. &quot;Uhg, I wish that Lemmy
heard
what I said. That dude will bend over backwards twice to not offend
anyone and yet he was there with you and Luddy and ain't said crap?
Freaking circus loving dweeb keeping his lips sealed to look good...&quot;</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>Iggy
flushed. His reservations with Lemmy manifested not in any direction
confrontation, not his style anyway, but by him ignoring Lemmy. He
was actually surprised none of the family noticed their distance when
they'd be stuck to the hip every typical weekend. No one was really
themselves lately, explaining the phenomenon. He just hoped Lemmy
didn't become the clown in the family in a different way than
intended.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>...</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Back
in the village forces surrounded a solder under suspension of
espionage. After Bowser pushed through the crowd he approached Thwomp
#3, apparently an imposter caught by Sentry 11. The lakitu handed
over an electronic messenger from the thwomp, undoubtedly well used
recently.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Bowser
growled while pocketing the device in his shell. &quot;Be honest and
things might be a little less painful, spy. How much did you spill to
Mario aligned idiots? Did you get into our treasury chests?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>The
thwomp resisted the urge to shudder. Upon closer inspection he was
much to aged to have been a legitimate hire. &quot;I don't work for
Mario and I wasn't interested in your tacky junk treasures.&quot; His
tone was guttural with an unanticipated Mushroomy accent. &quot;I
wanted dirt on you and
it's been relayed already ages ago. The world knows you're stinking
up Giant Land. You freaks do what you want now!&quot;</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>Sentry
11 flashed a crooked grin, missing a few teeth on the sides. &quot;Hey
Boss, let me handle this one. I use to be a hitman before I joined
the troop and there's a.. special technique I haven't gotten to do in
much too long.&quot; He rubbed his hands together.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Great.
Get lost with the traitor. The rest of us got new plans-&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Oh
and I found this too, Boss. The princess was using this thinking we
were too dumb to see her.&quot; The next object the sentry presented
was pink with rhinestones, Peach's cell.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>The
princess on the outskirts of the wicked gathering felt the ground
give way under her.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Bowser
gawked at the glittery phone before pocketing it as well. &quot;How
did this go on for so darn long? Kamek? I thought you could detect
sneaky stuff? Eyes in the back of your head, or third eye or however
you said it?!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Lord
Bowser, that was me in my prime and in our comfortable castle with
all of my books and scrolls and helpful sticky notes on how to do my
rites. Now I'm doing well if I can keep my specs from fogging up.
Besides,&quot; the magikoopa replied with mild offense, &quot;I had
to leave behind my scepter back at the castle. Without it I'm-&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;-Yeah
yeah. Forget I asked ya, gramps.&quot; Bowser waved him off in
irritation. He would leave Camp Bowser as is for now while moving his
personal fleet, princess included, to the tropical paradise of Water
Land as his daughter suggested. She was rarely one to get so involved
lately but he didn't think it over too hard. Change was good and
things could only go up from there.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>...</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Ludwig
played around with the weighty Mega Villain badge in his paws during
the lengthy taxi ride. At first it began to pall him and now it in
fact spawned contempt. Everything leading to this moment now was of
questionable worth and finally Ludwig was brave enough to not force
himself out of that state of mind. A bump in the road made it fall
from his loose grip and bounce under the seat in front of him. He
shed his jacket so he could stretch and blindly reaching for it,
eluding the crumbs and dust caked down there, he brushed against
something black and spherical, a bob-omb. Reluctantly Ludwig ignored
the implications of his cabbie, a stubbly faced but mundane red boo
having that. The sooner they got to the Mushroom Kingdom the better.
Then he could stealthily use one of their warp pipes to get to Giant
Land and.. he wasn't sure.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;-Tell
me something, Prince. How did you invent that tornado thing that
flipped Dark Land upside down?&quot; the driver asked, curiously
eyeing Ludwig from the rear view. He lowered the volume on the talk
radio station.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Ludwig
felt a wave of heat in his face, scrambling for the least
incriminating explanation. &quot;Don't let the rumors mislead you. It
was not a projection or a subordinate of mine, though I venture it
was perhaps sentient, but what happened was real and out of our
control. Very much so.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;I
hope that badge was worth this big ol' mess! Sucks even your workers
Sam and Slam payed the price too.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Ludwig
tuned it out that as a long river running along the road sparked
something in him.. &quot;...Please, stop the vehicle!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>They
skid to a stop on the road's shoulder. Ludwig rushed out and ran to
the water's edge, launching the forsaken Mega Villain pin as hard as
he could. In slow motion it sunk into the water and disappeared.
Everything about him in that instant felt lighter, like the noose
around his neck loosened he could breathe again. Taking just another
moment to collect himself he leisurely returned to the car, fiddled
with the greasy tattered backseat belt, avoided the suspicious stain
in the seat- and glanced upwards to find his very own engraved orange
NES zapper aimed eye level.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Nice
heat you're packing buddy! I like how you can really feel the weight.
Solid trigger too.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Ludwig
took a deep breath. &quot;I fail to understand why you choose now to
rob me. I do not possess much. Not anymore!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;You
got enough for
me, hehe. Plus river's convenient for your body. Now GET OUT!&quot;</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>Ludwig
slid out and trudged towards the grass shore, arms raised.
Instantaneously the red boo was at his back.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Now
what did your janitor have to do with the first storm?! How did he
win your competition? How is Bowser controlling it?&quot; the boo
snarled down his neck. &quot;Speak up!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Ludwig
wasn't sure he was more dazzled by the robbery in broad daylight or
the assailant's insistence on that other matter. &quot;Easy I beg of
you! You lack perspective, the underling Zoo didn't mean to- We
didn't- Okay, it was all a mistake! It was all a mistake and it is my
fault and I would have fixed it possibly if-&quot; The koopaling's
eyebrows lowered. &quot;-If you didn't ruin my day further. How are
you privy to these facts?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Ha
ha ha. Bout that. I've been tracking your scaly behind since you left
Sky Land. Anyway, there's a few hundred miles of water here and it'll
be hard to find aaaalll your pieces scattered about!-&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;You
are despicable!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Thank
you.&quot; The boo bowed. &quot;Last words?&quot; he laughed.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Nearly
at the water's edge already, Ludwig dared to turn his head at the
boo. Seeing him so clearly now he was underwhelming. Just a middle
aged and slightly sloven if unhinged red boo. &quot;May I get
acquainted with you before the end? Name?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;What?..
Oh it's Trevor.&quot; The boo pressed the zapper into his back.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;You
look like a Trevor.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Ha
ha. That's what my parents said. Know what else they said I looked
like? A problem. Know where we're going with this? I get you're
stalling for your life because they all do that,&quot; Trevor
continued clinically. &quot;-And it makes sense. I find much delight
in getting to know the victim now that I think about it. Makes the
souvenirs in the back of my freezer more memorable...&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Ludwig
struggled keep his poker face. &quot;..So my question was who do you
like better? Mario or- who's that green one?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Green
Mario.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;That's
not quite right.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Aren't
they both Mario?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Ludwig
took another breath before his trembling became too noticeable. &quot;What
is the full name of Mario's brother?&quot; he pressed gently.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Just
messing with ya. He's my fav. Mario's brother is Luigi..Mario!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>A
loud violin chime startled the boo, originating from Ludwig's phone.
The koopaling activated the voice assistant when he first got out of
the car and catching the term 'Luigi Mario' it did what phones did
best, at least according to Ludwig. Make annoying noises at the worst
of times. Ludwig brought his elbow down on the boo's head and flung
him in the water. Ludwig bolted back to the car to find the keys
missing. He jumped back out and began to trace the ground for them,
getting blindsided by a hard punch. Ludwig's head smacked backwards
on the pavement.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Geh
zum Teufel,&quot; he groaned. He knocked Trevor off and shot a fire
ball his way. The boo turned invisible and reappeared on the other
side of him. Ludwig kicked him against the car and something clicked
loudly. The wheels began to roll on the car, like the brakes where
shot the entire time. It gained speed quicker than they could chase
it down the steep hill and bounced off the curb, careening into the
water. It splashed and sunk quickly.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>They
both stopped in the middle of the street, Trevor in particular
panting heavily. &quot;That was a company car, idiot! I am so fired,
man.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Ludwig
turned to him in disbelief, cursed, and then punched him straight in
the face. &quot;Listen carefully scoundrel! I do not care! I must
prevent a super powered being from taking away everything and
everyone I love and I'm running out of time due to people like you!
Piss off!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>The
boo got off the asphalt, rubbing his eye placidly. &quot;First of
all, nice hit. Secondly, we know buddy. This was just my signature
interrogation technique. Don't tell anybody but I'm actually Agent M
of Super Spy HQ in Toad Town. We were trying to make sense of what's
going on with you and your family and I was doing better than any
other agent until whatever just happened. That wasn't scripted! Now
we have a long ways into town. Drats. I hate freaking walkin..&quot;
he trailed off.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Ludwig
felt a dizzy sensation watching the boo float down the street. It was
just too much, but by Eldstar's will he had to go on. He had to, he
repeated to himself, if only to mend what he'd so callously shattered
two days ago.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>...</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Down
South any and all enemy species dwelling in or around the shanty town
and even north into Toad Town were briefly under suspicion of being a
secret spy. Old prejudges threatened to ferment but there was no real
basis for paranoia many concluded. Crop fires were extinguished,
robotic yoshis were locked back up, a certain patooie nurse was
reprimanded again, and everything calmed down. Mario closed in on the
boo in the ten gallon, waiting until the best time to confront them.
They were hiding on an abandoned ranch tossing axes into an old
rotting fence for practice.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>The
plumber approached with extra caution. He'd met up with Yoshi about
this and what they discussed completely changed his direction.
&quot;Excuse me. Hi. It's me Mario. Just wanted to talk to you.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Booigi
slowly spun around, face flat yet still giving off that chilling
sensation like before.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;So..
Aren't you Boo? Boo Diddley? Before I sent Luigi off he was worried
sick over you and he'd be glad to know you're okay. If you'd calm
down and head back with us at the-&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;It's
Booigi the Second and I'm fine here.&quot; Booigi tossed an axe and
struck the bullseye perfectly. &quot;What did you think of my
performance before?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;It
was something alright, but you know that's not our style. Luigi would
agree.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Booigi
was about to toss another axe when they froze, weapon in the air.
&quot;Gaaah! Shut up! I do everything for him!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Fine!
Fine!&quot; Mario fled the scene before he got zapped or impelled. He
returned to the Southern Hospital where Yoshi waited under the shade
of its porch. Mario leading him back out onto the streets explained,
&quot;I located the guy with the hat and scarf! You were right, it
was Boo all along.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>They
continued to the sorta creepy trail leading to Booigi's hideout. It
was away from the shanty town or hospital or any cabins and thus away
from any sources of help. Mario shook his head when they got there,
and hesitated to step on it again, as if it was a booby trap rigged
to go. &quot;We can't have a loose cannon like that. They had the
crowds mesmerized at first then wild next. It was crazy, like a
Bowser Party.&quot;</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;I
agree but at least the Bowser spies aren't an issue anymore.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>&quot;Only
because TriggerHappy McBoo murdered that
Bowser crook.&quot;</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;So
that's an issue?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Mario
whipped his way and stared at him. &quot;...Yoshi, yes, yes it is!
First I'm forced by an injury to sit around in hillbilly county
managing groups of others like I have some boring office job and now
I can't even keep everyone organized and safe 'cause of killers like
that!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Melting
into the ground almost, Yoshi said, &quot;I'd know about that,
wouldn't I?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Mario
softened, regretting his blunt tone as usual. &quot;It was different
for you. Besides when I say killer I don't mean literally anyone. I
mean... Forget it.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Yoshi
sighed. &quot;Right, sorry to be a drag. After everything that
happened just yesterday I'm still, you know...&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Yoshi
found himself in Mario's embrace, the only thing so far he discovered
that could break up the dark cloud within him. &quot;And I'm here to
help with anything you need.&quot; Mario then slyly added, &quot;Now
let's pay Triggerhappy a visit. With body armor this time.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>...</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Mario
was running late. Kylie Koopa wore a trench in the ground pacing
under the local water tower. Sometimes she'd enter the spy car that
brought her in the rustic territory for some air conditioning. Mr.
Jelectro waiting in the drivers seat did not say a word to her. She
supposed the noki was indeed exiled to the couch last night. What a
bump on a log. By contrast she could nearly burst like a bulky
bob-omb from excitement. She dashed to meet her guest half way.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Mario
great to see ya. When I first got in town why was there a mob of
folks carrying torches and pitchforks and scythes?! I know a lot of
the locals are farmers but.. So anyway we got Sarasaland on the line
brother, from Daisy Castle. I worked with some Toad Town spies to do
something special and who else deserves the honor than Mario!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Flabbergasted,
Mario took the receiver from her. He didn't attempt to explain why he
had bruises all over from some recent altercation with a curtain ten
gallon hat wearer. He could make out General Yura, Roar, and Tao in
the background.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Hello?
It's me, Mario.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;MARIO?
HA HA OLD CHAP, JUST GOT THE WRONG NUMBER. MEANT TO GET CASTLE KOOPA.
TA TA,&quot; said a grating unfamiliar voice.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Mario
froze, eyes darting between Kylie who mirrored his expression, to the
unreadable noki and not getting the announcement he wished for that
this was some sort of joke from either. &quot;Who is this? And how
did you mistake my number for Bowsers?!&quot; he demanded the beeping
disconnected tone.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>One
possible explanation came to him quickly. He lost an old cell phone
of his years ago in enemy territory and some of its data got leaked,
including his address book. For a little while there was some mix up
because he had Bowser's number saved under his own name as a crazy
idea to keep his friends from knowing when he was calling his rival.
Well he shouldn't feel too bad. Bowser told him once he had Mario
saved under 'Buttercup' to throw off his family. Now that was a dumb
idea, and also a strange tangent just then...</span></font></font></font></p>

<p>
<p>Captain
Toad reached around blindly before he found the lantern switch. Its
orange glow exacerbated his dull headache. That was probably the best
he could hope for after yesterday's events with Luigi. Speaking of
that plumber, he was quite a partner and he'd leave it at that,
uncannily good at following maps a consistent amount of degrees off,
redolent of someone too comfortable with improperly calibrated
compasses. He noticed Luigi's empty green sleeping bag besides him.
The toad unzipped his red sleeping bag and slowly crawled out,
covered in day old cuts and bruises. His bandage wrapped feet had
stopped bleeding which was great, their adventure was long from over.
It was foggy in the south western quadrant of Giant Land, nothing
above but white. Everything felt more uncharted than usual without
the brigade The Captain was accustomed to, more perilous in the face
of obstacles and trials. Giant Land had no lack of such.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>A
twig snapped. The Captain paused his set up of the camp as something
rustled in the bushes. He scanned around pickaxe in hand before
something yanked the tool from his palms.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Gotcha.&quot;
Materializing behind him, Luigi dangled the pickaxe from a handmade
green vine lasso. A bandanna of blue denim was wrapped around his
forehead and he was topless, only sporting some spare pants he'd
brought along, tucked into his hiking boots. &quot;You have to stay
vigilant!&quot; he advised cheekily. &quot;.. Not a morning person?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Captain
Toad's countenance became even more flat and dead like a Mummy-me. He
jabbed a stick into some meat on a plate he'd prepared and held it
over the fire bouncing in his humble little firepit. &quot;I suppose
so, Mr. Luigi.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Luigi
sat opposite side of the fire crisscross style. &quot;We're better
off than you think. All Mario and I use to have were rocks to sleep
on. Rocks! Well, you slept into the afternoon and we need to move on.
How much longer is that Tayce T. impersonation gonna take?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Until
this thing I killed yesterday isn't raw.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Luigi
watched the flames jump around and gave himself the time to rest from
training all morning. He'd dread the pressure of living up to Mario's
work in any other situation but this adventure felt different for
reasons he couldn't discern. Maybe it was the high stakes, but he
really had to give it his all. &quot;Hurry up already. You know I ate
something raw a few minutes ago!&quot; Luigi subtly puffed out his
hairless chest.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Don't
do that. You might get sick,&quot; The Captain droned.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;I
was talking about berries you spoilsport!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>On
the hunt for Bowser they continued. Hidden piranha plants clamped
onto their legs while they avoided suspicious huts nestled among the
forest on the way to for the river ahead, the body of water flowing
through the kingdom of Giant Land. Luigi and Captain Toad hauled a
small raft of logs they spent the night on to the river bank and took
the plunge. They were violently pulled a five miles down by
unpredictable rapids. They became drenched hanging on for dear life
and avoiding Boss Bass. Quickly they approached a tall dam of rocks
and were going to crash.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Abandon
ship!&quot; Luigi let go to dip in the river while the raft was torn
apart by the boulders. He rose and paddled, looking around. &quot;Stan?
STAN?&quot; Heart in his throat, he spotted the Captain atop the dam
and rushed to his aid, tossing rocks aside to uncover the toad from
the pile, then shaking him.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>He
regurgitated a stream of water. &quot;Mr. Luigi..thank you... But
it's..Captain Toad..&quot; he gasped. &quot;And what is-?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>He
lifted up from an old thwomp camouflaged underneath him. Their two
black eyes fluttered, coming to. Branded on a spike was a faded
Bowser emblem reminding Luigi of a temporary tattoo. It took them a
dozen tugs to eject the stone baddie from the rubble and get him on
the muddy shore line.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Thanks,&quot;
the thwomp grunted, groggily righting himself. He saw the duo and
looked at them funny. &quot;Lemme take you two to Bowser's camp right
now!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Still
shaking the water out his ear, Captain Toad mirrored the expression.
&quot;Excuse me?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;You
coming or what?&quot; The thwomp rose in the air a short distance and
slammed back down, 'walking' deeper into the forest.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Soon
they followed the path of thwomp sized intentions in the ground
heading north and close the boundary line of something guarded by a
barb fence and cameras. A bright spot light aimed around in an
erratic pattern. Eventually Luigi had to 'go', just missing the
opportunity in the water. He trailed behind to finish business, then
sprint to catch up. One step on the main path again and Luigi
wandered past a laser, causing an alarm to sound.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;For
the last time get away from my house and stop stepping on my property
and stealing my land and peeing in my plants!&quot; The house rumbled
as someone charged down stairs and then out of the doors with massive
earth quaking steps.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Having
nowhere to run, Luigi braced himself and got ready for the medic
bill. &quot;I'm here for the princess and not Bowserrrrrr!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>The
goomba skid to a stop a foot away from him. A switch flipped he
became a flat faced yet brilliant looking mushroom, believably
responsible for the impressive array of electronic surveillance and
satellite dishes in the middle of nowhere. &quot;I see you are indeed
a hero with such outerwear. Like an action star! I would know my
guest, I incessantly watch reruns of the old classics. Please excuse
my spectacle before, the oppressive Koopa Troop are utterly
detestable to me!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Shivering,
Luigi peeked through the crack in his fingers. &quot;Umm. Who are
you?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Richard
Goomba Sr. PhD and not the one that visited Mushroom Kingdom hospital
East, that was my son with the MKDCU. Is there anything you need my
guest?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Luigi
observed that the doctor's yard was like a jungle in itself, high
grass and curious antiques spread about. Something caught his eye.
&quot;Well..&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>A
deranged shirtless man on a vintage chunk of steel, a WW63 era
motorbike with an engine roaring like it was born yesterday, burst
into camp making enemies squawk and flee. All they had against him
where slingshots at best as he rode by jousting them with a heavy
duty plunger, also an WW63 antique. He was Rambo
Mario,
not leaving a single baddie standing without a face full of decades
old toilet water.</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>A
hammer brother stumbled out of the outhouse. &quot;That's Luigi! Get
backup!&quot; Captain Toad then swung down from the tree above
knocked him out. The toad had been waiting for Luigi to show up,
imagining the delay was bad berries.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>All
of the foes at the camp's gate defeated, Luigi revved up the bike
before the astonished toad Captain. &quot;Pick your jaw up and hop
on!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>...</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;...That's
how you lose fingers, trying to peep into boss' treasures while I'm
in charge.&quot; A long jagged edged knife lay beside him as a silent
warning. The actual chests were tucked away deep in the room, in a
'safe' place and away from the inquirers.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;B-but
we're running out of toilet paper! Please please please please-&quot;
the koopa subordinate continued endlessly.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>He
paused, taking a deep breath that made his listeners on edge. &quot;Open
it then. Keep bothering me and I'll-&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Be
my guest, Sentry,&quot; the third person in the cabin snapped. &quot;Tell
me. What is your real job?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;-Terrorizing
you all!&quot; The lakitu suddenly stabbed the wooden table before
him with the blade, making the koopa and magikoopa jump. &quot;Now
scram! I claimed this cabin because someone left a pedicure kit in
here and I'm gonna use it gosh darn it!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>The
koopa and a magikoopa stumbled out of the deepest cabin in Camp
Bowser, near the storehouse that burnt.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Nice
try!&quot; Luigi knocked their heads together while Captain Toad
kicked the door open again. They both caught the grizzled lakitu
hitman gingerly filing his ugly curled nails.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Sentry
11 lifted his head up, only mildly alarmed. &quot;A half naked Mario
brother and a toad. Interesting.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>They
both charged him so he rolled backwards, knocking the pink foot tub
containing nail files and bath salts in their way. As they climbed
over the clutter, the lakitu nimbly sprung onto his cloud to attack
with spiked balls. He went around the table, to them the size of a
huge dinette set. Luigi ducked and used his lasso to knock away the
spikes raining down. As his kind was known for, the lakitu got the
slip out of the window. A second later, they heard a click on the
door. Captain Toad rushed to it and tugged. Locked. He swung his
pickaxe but it bounced off and created a thin spidery fracture
through the steel.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Captain
Toad groaned at first but then changed subject. &quot;Since we are
immobilized Mr. Luigi, where'd your motorbike come from?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;A
Mega Goomba recluse that's a retired doctor, has a skeleton of a
human in his home, suspiciously next to the photo hung up of his ex
wife, collects war memorabilia, has a pretty good stereo, and watches
people take a leak in his garden..&quot; Luigi knocked on wood to
feel how dense the door was. &quot;Ever sent off a flare before?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>...Leaning
around a tall, old, and tired oak even older, taller, and more tired
than him, the liberated thwomp was flabbergasted how quiet the camp
became in mere minutes. Just last night he was cooped up with the
Koopa Troop on night watch as so-called 'Thwomp #3', gambling for the
prize of the peanut butter sandwiches someone snatched from Kammy's
picnic basket like the rest of them, inwardly wishing Bowser went
down in the fire at the store house. It'd had been easier that way,
but espionage in Dark Land was never easy. He made his way past the
unconscious koopa bodies until the ground shook. He gaped at a the
old BeanBean battle tank rolling through the camp gates.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Tally-hoooo!&quot;
Richard Sr. screeched. The tank spun and fired at an empty hut that
exploded into flames higher than the canopy.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Crazy
loon!&quot; the thwomp barked, picking himself up. &quot;This is
Agent 999 of Super Spy HQ, stop that! Stop that right now- hey!&quot;
The agent squeezed his eyes shut as another golden bullet bill
whizzed over his head and exploded on a building.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;I'm
on a koopa scum hunt. WHERE THEY AT?!&quot; Richard went on
belligerently.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>...Some
distance away, Luigi put his ear to the exterior wall, occasionally
fanning the smoke leftover from their homemade chimney flare. &quot;You
hear something? Just want to be sure since that lit bob-omb you
handed me without warning made my ears ring and-&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Captain
Toad stifled a laugh as he 'strategically' chipped at the rotting
chest they'd found in the corner next to the bathroom stall. &quot;Do
not interrupt Mr. Luigi. This is delicate, one wrong move and-&quot;
The axe handle snapped and the flat heavy blade smashed his toe. He
cursed loudly.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Luigi
darted from the wall to the opposite corner. &quot;Sounds about
right! Quick get over here!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>There
was a huge bang at the wall being torn in two and falling flat,
taking half of the roof with it and sending the mega sized bricks and
logs in the sky. Once the dust cleared there was the cannon of the
tank aiming at the opposite wall that remained standing. Luigi's back
was against it and his chest rose up and down rapidly, teeth in his
head clattering.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;T-there
were no koopas here. It was us, doctor!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>The
small circular hatch opened and Richard Sr. in a combat helmet
emerged after a tight squeeze. The pipe fell out of his mouth. &quot;My
goodness! This is where they kept you captive?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Yes!
Locked us in. Thanks for.. Oh snap!&quot; Luigi saw a little pale arm
sticking out under wreckage. He slung off what he could. The Captain
was found on top of the wooden chest, shattered from the force of his
body into a pile of gold coins, broken glass, and a wad of old notes.
&quot;Captain!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Call..Me..Stan..&quot;
The most important pieces slipped from Captain Toad's hand. There was
an old map of Dark Land, Magikoopa rites, and a yellow writing
tablet.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Luigi
was just noticing Dr. Mario's signature on one of the papers when
Agent 999, the thwomp they'd just rescued, barged through the door
frame still standing somehow, eyes bloodshot. &quot;You're all under
arrest!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>...</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;If
you think the disasters follow you buddy, are you bringing it to Toad
Town on purpose? You know I have family here. I take offense to
that.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;-Well
I-&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Nah
just kidding. They're all dead.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Well
I!-&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Nah
just kidding again. Ha ha. They moved last year. Ha ha...&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Ludwig
then needed some fresh air, cranking the window to let the warm
breeze flow through his hair. His company was not his ideal, but he
was assisting him in traveling to Toad Town in their replacement
ride, a large company truck. A part of Ludwig was content because
despite the weighty matters on his plate the light was on the
horizon. A sad flicker, but illumination regardless.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Ludwig
spoke again, &quot;-Agent, I never explained did I? I need
cooperation from Mario and associates, as you informed me that Mario
is still in town and he sent his brother in pursuit of my father in
place of himself, so I need to pull an assembly together to tackle my
mysterious foe collectively-&quot; Ludwig paused while the owner of
the vehicle they were 'borrowing' made a sound from the trunk.
&quot;Speaking of which, he can breathe back there, correct? I refuse
to share a murder charge with you. I am not fully convinced you do
not already have one, Agent!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;...&quot;
Agent M began to giggle behind the wheel. Flying down the road they
passed under a sign stating that the next exit was 'Starman Lane'.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Never
mind. Take... that road!... Then let's travel along so and so..&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>The
pink boo pulled off the exit and into Toad Town, driving along until
they were a block away from the post office. They parked on the curb.
&quot;Here? You sure buddy?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Ludwig
exited the vehicle, lingering in the door. &quot;I'm sure. Thank you
for this favor you were under no obligation to do for poor me, but
I'm not your buddy. Please, don't start,&quot; Ludwig nearly laughed.
&quot;Oh and can you perhaps wait for me?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Toad
Town was not demilitarized like Poshley Heights so he had a bullseye
on his head the moment stepped away from the car and everyone could
get a look at who he was. A koopa jogger with a bandage on the back
of his head going down the sidewalk pointed at him and jumped on his
phone. Rotten mushrooms spontaneously battered his head from out of
thin air, or more specifically from the apartments above his head
occupied by toads glaring at him from the windows. He dashed inside
the post office. Parakarry was behind the desk dealing with high
stacks of overfilled cabinets towering to the ceiling. A bulging
satchel ready to go hung on a rack to his right.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Rain,
snow, sleet, you get it,&quot; he greeted, busily grabbing letters.
&quot;What do you need to send off?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;My
message to Mario: I, Prince Ludwig must meet with them urgently!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>The
mail carrier gave a start when he rose his head and faced the
koopaling for the first time. &quot;..I'm really backed up. You will
have to deliver that on your own, sir,&quot; he advised, trying to
mask apprehension.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Ludwig
put his claws to the desk and leaned forward. &quot;Are you certain?&quot;
he pressed.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Parakarry
pulled down a black mesh visor over the desk, closing up right in
Ludwig's face. &quot;I am indeed, sir!&quot; With a mischievous
smile, the mail carrier whisked himself out the office. Ludwig was
forced to egress and discover that his 'buddy', the secret agent's
vehicle had vanished, leaving only the oil puddle.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Ludwig
muttered in German as someone was rushing him from down the block.
The snifit in police uniform then revealed a taser. &quot;...Oh, what
is- bbbbbbppppptttttttttt!&quot; the koopaling sputtered while
electricity ripped through his entire body. His blue hair stood up,
he wet himself, and seconds later he was out.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>...</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>The
yellow faded notebook was plopped on a table after the trophies and
war conquest medallions were brushed aside, also the ashtray, the
remote to the alarm system, and the other remote to the other alarm,
the remote to the remote, and more clutter. Sadly this was the
cleanest room belonging to the goomba doctor.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>&quot;'I
want tuna for today, I want a sandwich too.<p><span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>&quot;
Luigi read a little farther down Dr. Mario's stream of consciousness
in written form. &quot;Last
week's pay only fifty coins, but this is the recession&hellip; Items
used for Megavitamin X: Sulfate, so and so.'</p><span style="font-variant: normal"><p>
"That last one. The secret ingredient is koopa scales!&quot;</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;I
could see that..&quot; Richard Sr added. The mega goomba the checked
under newspapers covering his windows in a paranoid fashion.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Yep,
they didn't have the technology back then to- Why am I speaking to
you people?&quot; the thwomp agent complained, tied up on the couch
with extra thick extension cords. &quot;I knew you were looking for
that missing part for Mario and now you have it, so let me go!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Luigi
discreetly folded the note. &quot;So you were pretending to work for
Bowser to get it yourself?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Not
exactly, I do this in general to keep HQ on top of the fool. Bowser
has no records so no one ever notices an extra thwomp. Only got
caught cause this new situation put the troop in closer quarters than
usual.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Mmmm
mm mm?&quot; asked Captain Toad, muffled by a suffocating but
essential neck brace Luigi was kind enough to make for him. He'd
never question the green plumber's abilities again, at least not
outwardly..</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;What
about the storms, lil toad? HQ ain't cracked that code yet. To be
honest I was offsite 'n I didn't see roofs peeling with my own eyes
either. I just know it comes out of no where and includes lots of
thunder.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Hmm.
So you're Agent 999 at your HQ, but who's Lieutenant Stone then?&quot;
Luigi held an ID they'd combed from the rock baddie.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;I
am. That's my real title and even when I slip, the koopa's dumb as
bricks. We're done? My butt itches and I want to go home.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Luigi
checked his watch, remembering green pipes in Richard's backyard.
&quot;Doctor, thanks for the hospitality and the cool bike and the
tank rescue and this weird bullet souvenir you say you pulled from
your own heart in the war, but we're on an urgent mission and all and
I noticed you had something we can use to get out of here quick...&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>...</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>&quot;Be
on guard, pards. We were once delivered a barrel of Ukiki and I was
the only guy that could keep the lid down,&quot; Jr. Troopa said to
Mario and a few of his staff lined up against the South gate that
split the territory from Toad Town. The teenager followed up with
additional tall tales as they half paid attention, impatiently
awaiting for a mystery crook to be handed over by the Toad Town
justice enforcer Snifit
Patrol.No
one knew much of the masked vigilante's origin and were only told to
keep an eye out for a silver futuristic car, precisely the one
speeding closer down the dusty path. It missed their wide open gate
and smashed through the sturdy closed one beside it.</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Dern
it! I just fixed that!&quot; Probabilly yelped.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Mario
coughed from the red desert dust while the window rolled down.
&quot;Mario! I caught a good one this time!&quot; the snifit inside
the vehicle said. Mario's memory was jogged only then.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>The
plumber then shifted towards the dark tinted backseat window. &quot;Is
it that thing with people like Birdo again? It better not be!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;No
no no no no. I, yeah, I learnt my lesson! And the restroom thing
too...&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>&quot;And Peekaboo
badges aren't illegal either, even if you can kinda see people in
their underwear with it!&quot;</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Nooo!
Ha ha. Just see! Drum roll pleeeease!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>The
window rolled down and they gave a start at Ludwig von Koopa's dazed
and slumped over figure.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Ludwig?&quot;
Mario began, &quot;Why aren't you with Bowser?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>He
snapped awake. &quot;Mario!? I mean, of course! Uh- I will explain
and quickly: There is a 'dark star' we are quarry to, we being
everyone involved in my Mushroom Flu plot that was fulfilled Friday.
This includes even Sam and Slam, remember what happened to Hotel
Delfino? Maybe not, the local news is congested and someone would
rather hear a tawdry sales pitch than incline the ear to the pain and
suffering of islanders thousands of miles away... So where 'we' go is
marked to get attacked by catastrophic gale forces and I need your
help to resolve this and save my family's lives. I'm alone because I
decided to travel to Poshley Heights for an award, one that is in the
company of cheep cheeps currently and I no longer care about such. I
WILL fix my mistake. Whether I intended to or not it began with me
and now it must end with me. Am I clear?&quot;</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>Mario
and Jr. Troopa continued to stare.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Soooo,
want me to bring him into town down here?&quot; Snifit Patrol
inquired.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Yoshi,
the blue and yellow toads, and Toadette were at the checkers table
for a team game out at a isolated area of the land, in the shade of
the water tower and away from the bustling town square or Southern
hospital. The game was Buckenberry and Toadette's red side verses
Ala-Gold and Yoshi's black side. The dino was having much more fun an
expected, and it took his mind off the stinging electric burns from
confronting Booigi. Yoshi made random moves whenever it was his turn
and judged if it was a good or not from their reactions. The thought
it might be checkers they were playing, but then again they were
stacking pieces up to five high and incorporating extra parts he
didn't think belonged, like promotional figurines.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Gold
Fish!&quot; Buckenberry said, shoving his Mini Peach against a Mini
DK.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Toadette
made a face. &quot;Wrong game, Blue. Anyway Mr. Yoshi, what's wrong
with living with us at the castle? I heard you're already searching
for something down town?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;I
love helping you all restore it, its not that, but Peach will get
rescued and might not want an old dinosaur around.&quot; Besides the
place was half underwater currently, he thought, and these toads
loved the party at night.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;I
understand. Avoid Hotel Mario for sure! There's Melon Bugs all over
the darn place and they don't care.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Oh
I will.&quot; Yoshi made another move. His side had more than theirs
so that had to be good he guessed.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Mr.
Yoshi,&quot; she approached shyly, &quot;If it's not intruding...&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Yoshi
tore his gaze from the cluttered game board. &quot;No, it isn't. We
just broke up is all.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Buckenberry
gasped. &quot;Nooo way! The rumors are true? You must have choose
wrong, cause no sane girl would dump you. You are a super popular
hero and a friend of Mario and green? That's the second best color
after red. You know that makes you a ten, right?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>Yoshi
smiled uncomfortably. It was more like <em>Birdo</em> chose
wrong in him. His heart was with someone else and always was, even if
he was obscuring that fact from himself. Now he wasn't entirely
superficial like she had the impression, judging from how they'd
spoken that morning to discuss splitting property. Maybe he didn't
know her favorite color- not pink apparently, and take shots in the
dark with his gifts to her- she preferred Android phones in actually,
but he did pick
up on the big details. She knew her priories of a stable life, she
was introverted, she had a rare true grace, even when infuriated with
a knuckled headed fianc&eacute; like him, she valued the small things
like a beautiful view of the sunset over a home that was closer to a
convenience store. Most importantly, she was content to make a guest
appearance in a game or two of Mario's, but not ALL of the main
series ones. She was a
catch and someone out there was perfect for her. It just wasn't him.</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>That
was quite a package for a bunch of toad kids, so he condensed it to,
&quot;Just make sure you are being honest with who you are and what
you want.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;...Hear
that brah?&quot; Alagold, who seemed to listen the closest, asked the
blue toad. &quot;I saw your latest profile on LevelGrindr.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Buckenberry's
eye twitched. &quot;I'm all those things.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Oooh,
I'm looking at it now. It says you're six-two and 250lbs? -What,
soaking wet and in heels?&quot; Toadette laughed, scrolling on her
phone.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Grrrrr!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;You
know we love you,&quot; she teased, pinching his blushed cheekes.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Yoshi
made a move on the board before Buckenberry could flip it in the air
and ruin the game. Based on Toadette and Buckenberry's simultaneous
groan, the dinosaur realized that he'd just won that very interesting
game.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>The
noises they'd been hearing for some time got louder, pipes clanging.
Yoshi craned his neck upwards at the water tower where the vibrations
originated. They abandoned the game at the table and leaped out of
the way as the tower emitted a deep gurgle. A spot on the ground got
darker before a spout of water shot up high in the sky. It happened
in another spot as they ran frantically towards the nearest help,
which was a phone booth a block down caked in dust from lack of use.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Yoshi
and all the toads crammed inside while geysers kept popping up. A
notice stamped inside stated 'Need help? Holler at Mario here... Or
here, pard,' with two numbers listed. One number was Peach's castle
phone and one Mario's cell. Yoshi shoved a coin into the receiver and
made his call. &quot;Mario pick up! The pipe's gone bad!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Hello?
Yoshi?&quot; Luigi answered on the other end. Yoshi forgot that
number also routed to a house phone of theirs for backup. &quot;Cool
timing, I just got here. What's going on again? Actually, listen,
tell Mario the secret thing is koopa scales! Okay? Koopa-&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Yoshi
couldn't catch the end, the old phone blared static in his ear. The
call disconnected when a geyser erupted underneath them all, sending
the booth up and away to the 'moon'- actually a nearby billboard
advertising a Broadway adaptation of Super Mario Galaxy. It still
hurt though.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>...</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Splash!
Lemmy rose to the top of the water. &quot;Geronimo!&quot; he said
after the fact. Deep in paradise, this was the Koopaling's fifth dunk
in the water with a palm branch as his spring board.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Lounging
in a beach chair planted on the largest cay, 'Bowser Island' now, the
King Koopa stretched his arms. Roy was still out with what was left
of his army and his other kids were doing whatever. He grew tired of
reflecting on what to do. It gave him a headache. It was so much
easier to not think, just do. Just doing meant things got done, and
getting thing done was the point of life, right? Bowser turned to the
princess to his left, chained to a identical beach chair. She
gingerly pat her forehead with a white cloth. She'd liquified nearly
as the tropical sun beamed down, yet she'd adamantly refused to
change out of her long pink dress.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot;
Peach replied to his gaze curtly.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Getting
uncomfortable? Want a fan or somethin'?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;I
could use less 'fans' if you are included in that.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Bowser
gave a snort. &quot;Cute. Anyway, we can't sit on our butts forever.
I'm tired of swimming everywhere so let's start with some transport,&quot;
he ventured. &quot;Er, I heard there's a legendary canoe around. Ever
considered like a love boat or something?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Toadsworth's
tiny hands squeezed the bars of his cage. &quot;Don't pestering her,
you mad man. Tut tut! Give her a break.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Shuddup
old man!&quot; Bowser rose, fist balled.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Kamek
under a palm tree was snoring in his snug wearable blanket.
Subconsciously the magikoopa shut up.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;-I
mean my future old man- forget it! Gahhh!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Roy
and the squad marched through the shallow blue water connecting the
various islands raising their spoils: palms, paddle boards, small
crates of supplies, and lastly the Water Land king's long green robe.
Roy dropped it before his father, letting it gently fall into a
bundle. &quot;We ran 'em out so quick dey were just diving into da
drink to get away. Then we chased 'em some more, beat em, etc. So,
yeah..&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>Bowser
examined the garment with nods of approval. &quot;That's golden 
son.&quot; He noticed Roy sticking around digging his feet into the
sand. &quot;So what's the problem? I gave you stuff to do like you
wanted and now you're looking being a sourpuss yet again.&quot;</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;..It's
nothin'.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Then
act like it.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Lemmy
swam backstrokes around Wendy who floated on a tube sipping lemonade
and Morton silently tubing and reading a novel. He swam back to shore
and idly dried off his body and long rainbow hair with a towel, lost
in thought as some of the Troop marched around gathering resources
from the island. He couldn't shake it or ignore it. He'd quickly
developed a big brother instinct and it was going off. Maybe it was
something else too. Guilt.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>...On
another Water Land cay a fifteen year old leaned against an empty
ramshackled toad house. Larry watched rolling waves or fantasized
about being in a speeding sports car, waiting for a call back. Iggy
kept his company earlier before walking off with his ambitious watch
invention thing. That fringe of hope his older brother had didn't
totally convince him, but it was a dampener over the blaze inside of
him. When this was all over they'd have to hang more. They had all
the important shared interests: video-games, internet, hot girls,
gadgets, fighting, and pranks-</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;-BOO!
Hehehe! What are you doing?!&quot; Junior popped out of nowhere.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Heart
racing, Larry shoved him back. &quot;You little dweeb! Quit doing
that!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Oww!
You were gonna be a- what's that word? Re-bal, aren't you? I'm gonna
tell!&quot; the koopa child countered.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Larry
squeezed his eyes shut, counting down from ten to calm down. He only
made it to five. &quot;Again just shut up you stupid brat! If only
you knew who's really rebelling around here! Tell on me then! King
Dad takes you to a retarded little beach now you're back on his side?
Just GTFO. I never needed your help anyway!&quot; He heard his
screech voice amplified by the water around them. He had an epiphany.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Junior
covered his mouth with a flush. &quot;You're being so MEAN!&quot; he
squealed.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;I
know. I'm sorry. Whatever. Don't piss me off then,&quot; Larry
attempted to backtrack. Of course Junior wasn't the real problem
here, just a repeater of family rhetoric. &quot;Shh!&quot; He picked
up his cell as it rung with a simple bell noise. He was basic like
that. &quot;Hello Mushroom Caterers? Yeah put the order in for the
wings, the ribs, the booze, everything. Bring it to Water Land, can't
miss us. Gotcha baby. Bye.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Sentry
11 slowly rose over the horizon. His balaclava was missing, revealing
a round and very pale middle aged lakitu face graced with a greying
fuzzy little mustache. It was too late to hide for both koopa
adolescents.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Instead
he floated by. &quot;Just wait till boss hears how Green Mario found
the old base and I had to lock him in with our loot,&quot; he
muttered. &quot;The Kingdom's budget? Zero.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Larry
slowly followed him, waddling though the shallow water connecting the
kays. &quot;Well that's what's credit cards for! You know bout that
don't ya Junior?&quot; he tackled on to humor his little brother, and
also dissuade tattling on him for 'bad words'.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Oh
yes, I love those.&quot; Junior cheerily flashed his father's Master
Plan card. Many expensive toys were snuck onto the platinum slab of
plastic without Bowser noticing.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>When
they met back at base Bowser had decided to not cry over spilled Moo
Moo milk and would make Water Land the new Dark Land. He directed a
layout where a platform could go, a fortress, and more, before
learning that his stuff was looted back at Giant Land and his army
was halved yet again. The island shook like a volcano awakening and
the flames from Bowser rivaled the heat of one.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;I
knew it! Mario was practically next door and you thought I was
overreacting!?&quot; Bowser lashed out. &quot;EVERYONE ASSEMBLE.
NOW!&quot; The tropical island got packed with every mook the Koopa
King still had to his name. &quot;We're having the wedding to night
and NOTHING will stop it. NOTHING!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>...</p>

<p>The
koopa paratroopa slowly approached the dark spider web filled
corridor. He had a limp from an old injury but his stance was strong.
The human plumber gave him a nod and then closed the door, sealing
them in. A broken valve was just before them, gushing and flooding
the room.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Then
Mario turned the valve with light effort. Something rumbled before
the water stopped. One eyebrow rose. &quot;...That was easy.&quot;
All of the plumbing jobs he'd taken on were. What was more concerning
was how numerous they were, the backlog of work orders going back
years.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Probabilly
wrapped half a roll of thick duct tape around the dripping spot.
&quot;Usually is, Mr. Hero. If half the folks 'round here had a
brain, I wouldn't have a job!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Mario
gave him handshake, pitying the single janitor of the entire region
it seemed. Once out the corridor they received a round of applause.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Mario
rushed to one of the tallest in the crowd, hugging him tight.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Big
bro, all these acres of outdoors and somehow I knew you'd be inside
instead, fixing a toilet or something,&quot; Luigi teased. &quot;You
told Yoshi to call for me?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;No.
Thought he was with the toads. He stays at the castle now. But I've
been busy. Someone apparently dropped their Mario Galaxy Note 7
cellphone down the city's main septic tank or- or something.. Who the
heck would do that?&quot; People began agreeing with the famous hero.
Vick at that moment quietly escaped the utility home, whistling and
hoping no one would notice. Mario shrugged. &quot;Ah whatever.
Mistakes happen.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>...Eventually
they spotted their friends twenty feet in the air, stranded on a
Mario Galaxy billboard walkway. No one knew where a ladder was
because they didn't use them down South ever, except maybe Probabilly
who was on lunch break and without a phone. Mario personally searched
until he found a ladder stored away in a barn two large prairies
away. It seemed old and wobbly but it was 'reliable as they come,
pard', he was assured. He thought they'd just said they'd never seen
it before.. So the four standing and shivering in front of the
colorful Broadway show graphic could be rescued at last. The plumber
wanted to shoot up there himself, but was advised it was better to
let them descend. He could see the impact impression on the billboard
from the ground, cringing. Like a comet hit it, to fit the theme.
Blue and Yellow Toad slid down the ladder daringly and Toadette
hesitantly. She insisted she didn't have a heights problem
afterwards. Last was Yoshi, missing a boot.</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Mario,
it's all right. We're okay,&quot; Yoshi said with a smile. He latched
on to him, ignoring the sweat Mario was drenched in from running all
over the place. &quot;You did what you do best. Thanks.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Luigi
gracelessly walked up in the middle of their moment, got too close to
Mario, then held his nose. &quot;Umm.. whenever you're ready can we
get on that koopa scale secret ingredient thing? And someone just
told me Ludwig is locked up down here right now. What else did I
miss?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>...</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>That's
when Kylie Koopa gave up eavesdropping on Mario and crew from a
secluded bundle of desert cacti and bushes that aggravated her
allergies. The water tower area was her old hideout before the
impromptu waterworks, now too soggy to be of use. As evening rolled
over the South, there were little to no lamp posts for her to see her
strictly handwritten notes, never getting big into the digital thing.
'Prince Ludwig visits Toad Town' was a head line cooked up as she
checked her phone messages. She had a cryptic tip to meet someone in
the moo moo field..</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Babe.
Aren't ya happy to see me?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Kylie
almost turned around and left without a word but something in his
tone convinced her otherwise. &quot;I didn't need your help, Mitch.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Any
word on Sarasaland?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>She
put a hand on her hip. &quot;I was busy dealing with local stuff. But
no.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;You
needed my help,&quot; the toad chuckled. He rolled his wheelchair
over the uneven terrain, dirt furrowed for future crops.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Kylie
trailed him, carefully stepping over the trenches. &quot;How'd ya
even get here?!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Babe,
it's 2019. Everything is wheelchair accessible now..&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Mitch!
That ain't what I-&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>The
toad stopped and smiled inexplicably. &quot;Boo, there you are, bud.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>At
his prompt, a boo diddly appeared before them a rosy face, shivering
in the air. &quot;Uh, I knew Luigi was back and I wanted to see him
but then.. I messed it all up earlier when I got mad and&hellip;
D-don't tell Luigi I'm here! I'll figure something out!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;I
know you will. Now scram, kid.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Kylie
blocked her ex's way before he could move on. &quot;The heck is going
on? 'TriggerHappy' is now another intern of yours?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>He
shook his head seriously. &quot;Nah. We're hitting our deadline and I
need to do something dangerous, maybe impertinent, but it needs to be
done 'cause I'm the only one who knows how deep we really are in
this. As usual. I'll probably get hurt again too knowing my fortune
lately.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>She
breathed out slowly and fixed her gaze off at the jagged silhouette
of the hills. &quot;And that's the problem, brother. When Jelectro
was playing games with me I was madder than a red chomp, but then I
found out it was all because you tried to protect me from that Zoo
freak. That rocked me like Corona Mountain! I can't lose you after
all we've been though! Even if we went our own way years ago, can't
you see that we need to work together on this one? Whatever's going
on is crazy brother, so let me in before
you finally kill yourself! You aren't invincible. You aren't no
starman!&quot;</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;You're
right, babe,&quot; he started gently. &quot;I'll share my 'scoop'
with you. Just this time. Wheel me up to the top of Mt. Rugged and
then you'll see exactly what my research topic has been.&quot; He
tone eased into something darker, intoxicatingly alluring.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Kylie
fought against the tear threatening to roll down her face,
emotionally conflicted with him as routine. He still did this to her
embarrassingly. &quot;We'll see then.&quot; She flushed. &quot;Five
minutes at the top and by then you better catch me up or I'm dragging
you back down.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Up
the winding path they went under an orange red sky. After the trek
and with the assistance of some elevators, they were at the flat top
of the mountain, devoid of tourists for the hour, and could see the
vast landscape below, only a few lights twinkling from the rural
landscape.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>&quot;Happy?&quot;
She panted, leaning on a tall boulder. A visitor's sign on it stated
'<p>Watch
yer step, pard!'</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>Mitch
rolled a little farther towards the East with his eyes closed. Kylie
could then feel energy in the air. He'd done such a thing to solve
the mystery of the mystery boxes when they were still dating in
college, but she didn't know his abilities were still <em>that</em> sharp.
She dove down right away.</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;YOUR
MEDDLING IS FOOLISH, MORTAL.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>An
invisible force knocked them both back, tumbling many times across
brambles and pebbles. Kylie tucked in her shell could have taken a
power nap she felt in the time it took to plummet into a little
drainage pit at the bottom of the mountain. Adrenaline pumping she
saw an outline in the dark of a wheelchair bent in half and a body
sprawled face down next to it.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Mitch
groaned when she eased him out the trench. &quot;I'm o-okay, babe.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Kylie
scanned him, chest thumping. Her hands were damp. &quot;Mitch you're
bleeding!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Like
I said I'm okay.&quot; Kylie thought she saw him smirk. &quot;Hardly
felt it. Half of me is paralyzed anyway, remember babe?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Then
she rolled her eyes.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>...</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>On
the other side of the globe General Ming had done every unimportant
activity he could to pass time. The missing card key would on intrude
his thoughts once or twice while dusting Daisy's sports trophies or
filing paper work, but it was never a priority until work was
finished and he could evade it no longer. He decided to risk going
outside and checking their weapons bunker a short walk from the
castle. Immediately something sidetracked him, dark cloud like smoke
right over an old crumbling temple. He'd never worshiped there and
didn't think anyone had in a long time, yet someone had the audacity
of burn something there and likely get him blamed? Not on his watch!</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>He
marched up the stairs where moss and smooth stone intertwined and
then in between cracked stone columns where there was the center
roofless opening. He smelt no smoke and heard no crackling as he got
closer to the swirling formation in sky.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Ming
froze. General S&#464;w&aacute;ng was at the eye of the vortex above,
a bombshell koopa with a monocle and a dark goatee in a Victorian
suit. The rocketon had a few seconds to discern that this was an
ambassador and that he was making a bad first impression before he
was struck with a bolt of black lightning.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>General
S&#464;w&aacute;ng leisurely strolled up to the unconscious secretary
of Daisy's with a ornate walking stick. &quot;Jolly good. I was
looking for this!&quot; he said in a deep but posh and decidedly
English tone. He pocked gladly the key to the missile launchers in
the weapons bunker.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>...</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Ludwig
had hummed Reprisal in A minor from start to finish for the second
time, indicating he'd been locked up in Southern Mushroom Kingdom for
hours given how long his piece was. Not being taken seriously made
him seethe until the crack of light grew from the closed cell door.
It was Mario.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Turns
out you're promoted, koopa! Come on!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Ludwig
was dragged outside and to a peculiar barn, the agricultural building
glowing faintly green. Ludwig, despite his intellect, could not
fathom any feasible reason why that would be so.</span></font></font></font></p>

<p>
<p>&quot;Mario
Mario, I will tolerate your bullheadedness no longer!&quot; Ludwig
refused to budge just outside the barn door, the first time they'd
stopped scuttling through the village. &quot;Have you forgotten all I
have said? Now the sun has nearly set. I regret pleading my case to
you, for I could have ventured across two kingdoms by now!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Mario
placed one hand on the door handle. &quot;Sure you would have, or
maybe you would have been arrested immediately just like you were for
being a subject of Bowser,&quot; he replied exasperatedly.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Ludwig
seemed as though he was about to strangle him but wisely reconsidered
at the last moment. &quot;You. Do. Not. Get it! I would not deceive,
the Mushroom Flu plot bringing us to this present moment involved no
deception. I would not be so foolish as to detach myself from my
family, my support, and tread weaponless if my hands were laced with
nasty tricks. Everyone I care about is in grave danger here!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;You
poisoned sodas that innocent people drank and had your Zoo Diddley
freak pulling pranks no one found funny.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>&quot;-Well,
that's not
deception.
That's
called being a villain.. Besides, Zoo paid the price for his
questionably comedic contributions undeservedly by the dark star that
<em>I</em> spawned-
essentially,&quot; Ludwig admitted, his voice missing the boom it
normally had. A dark wave came over his features and his gaze frosted
over. &quot;-Plumber, I will beg no longer because you've forced my
hand. Keep me imprisoned if you want. If the Dark Star targeted Sam
and Slam thousands of miles away it will inevitably follow me right
here! I will go down and so will you.</p>
<p>
<p>Mario
settled one moment longer to rid himself of the palpitations that
statement brought. No way he'd show weakness to a Bowser minion. &quot;Let
me go back for a second. I wasn't trying to be a douche, we had to
tackle one issue at a time. I didn't realize all of that was going on
with Bowser so I thought Peach would be okay until we took care of
all of the sick people here literally dying before our eyes. You
know, priorities.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>The
koopaling's eyebrows rose then dropped then settled in-between. &quot;So
you really cured it? How? I mean I am impressed but-&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>&quot;We
had some smart folks from out of town people figure it out along with
some notes from Dr. Mario. You might know about it. Luigi infiltrated
your camp and beat your solders up! So, actually,&quot; he sighed
deeply. &quot;We need your koopa scales as the final ingredient and
we're done. Then we'll cure the sick and while they're recovering
think about that other stuff..&quot;</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>Ludwig
seemed to retreat within himself. &quot;So ein Mist.. Very well.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>The
koopaling stepped inside where his nose was bluntly impacted by the
smell of the barn turned mad laboratory. Typical for Special World
doctors. Ludwig on occasion attended their workshops located near
Star Road. As they refused repeatedly, even with enticement of
ludicrous amounts of gold coins, to duplicate Dr. Prof. Koopa's
teleportation potion Bowser made famous in Super Mario 64, his
feelings were quite lukewarm and not just because of the over
inflated travel costs. Only one narrow space didn't have buzzing
equipment or chemical filled tables in the way.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Prof.
X-Naut blocked his path. &quot;Ludwig Von Koopa? Ha. I knew you were
behind this with your unprecedented ability to reverse engineer virus
samples for evil!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Amused,
Ludwig decked the smaller man then stepped right over the grumbling
body, his least favorite to listen to during workshops. &quot;I
reverse engineered nothing this time, Morris. What I needed to do was
plainly written out.&quot; The other two doctors, Dr. Topper and Dr.
Goom he recognized in passing when he noticed them scribbling on
whiteboards in the far corners. Last was Dr. Toad approaching from
the opposite end of the corridor, wooden clipboard under his arm.
Ludwig actually hit it off with him, well 'hit off' by his standards
which meant they occasionally associated at some intellectual
recreation space in neutral territory. No telecommunication however.
He was.. not at that stage yet-</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;We
appreciate your cooperation, Ludwig,&quot; he said rather lively. &quot;I
will personally make sure you're much less uncomfortable than we keep
our patients usually.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>After
a moments hesitation, Ludwig bent down to the toad and lowered his
voice. &quot;You must assist me, Drew. Well, first of all I've been
meaning to tell you your last piece was splendid, I saw it at the art
gallery last month-&quot; He grabbed him. &quot;But more presently
I'm being held hostage!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;You
know that's exactly our style,&quot; Dr. Toad replied, easing out of
his grasp. &quot;Get the restraints!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>Before
Ludwig was tackled and tied to a table where horrors would unfold, he
tossed his <em>Ex
spatio obiecti specialem</em> book
to Mario guarding the door. The book, stiff and moldy from being wet
recently, smacked him in the face. Grumbling he picked it up. The
book naturally partitioned in the middle where a page was dogeared.
It held this passage:</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>'Star
beings mold the world with wonderful chaotic purpose or wonderfully
without perceptible purpose. Dark Stars hold similar power and, aware
of the greater forces, have been recorded as doing the same for their
own sinister motivations..'</p>
<p>...</p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>One
island of a tropical hemisphere called Water Land glowed orange in
the night from hundreds of burning palm branches, each individually
engulfed in time for Bowser and Peach's wedding. The bride and groom
stood on a sand mound altar with accessories of colorful flower
necklaces and the remaining Koopa Troop were the audience on the
beach. Peach faced her koopa tormentor and no one at all at the same
time, so distressed she was in another world. This just couldn't be
happening. Bowser had never gotten so far before, so close to
winning.
She had nothing left but to keep wishing fervently for something,
anything, to end the nightmare.</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Finally
I can see!&quot; Kamek received a silver electronic torch from Iggy.
Its blue beam when switched on illuminated their entire vicinity
awesomely, swallowing up the amber lighting and assaulting many
eyeballs. Peach then had to add blindness to her current predicament.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;This
device is splendid, Lord Bowser. Ah, I had a vision of something this
amazing. -Or maybe it was an as seen on TV commercial-&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Bowser
shielded his face with one hand. &quot;-Old man, are you alright?
Calm down, shine that stupid light the other way, and start the
ceremony!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Kamek
jut the Kingly Law book out. &quot;Do you take Princess Peach as
your- Ah, I forgot something. Any objections? Speak now or forever
hold your peace.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Steam
shot out of Bowser's nose. &quot;I don't care what any of you think!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;I
have objections anyway, you brute!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Bowser's
teeth grinded against each other, inclined to snatch Toadsworth right
out of the audience and pulverize him.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Rather
predictably old mushroom wasn't the only would be wedding crasher.
Morton rose up, &quot;King Dad, I must object! We cannot settle here!
I know you attempted to abate me this morning but I can not let it
go, drop it, or forget it. We should be using this time to get to the
other side of the globe, vacate, leave the premises just like Zheng
Koopa does in my book!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Lemmy
glanced over his siblings in disappointment. &quot;Not again!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Roy
stood around at the end of the front row with the zombie like
demeanor he'd had all day until then, when Morton's grating speech
opened the floodgates. &quot;Alright! I agree with 'em. I'm missing
home real bad, okay? Why can't we just go back? I'm tired of running
all over da place and I miss all my old Koopa Ball buddies in Dark
Land. I left my gal back there! Here we have nothing and I'm sick of
waitin' for whatever else is gonna go wrong!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;AAAHHHHHGG!&quot;
Bowser growled.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;-Daddy,
he's right. We should have set up somewhere else,&quot; Wendy cut in.
&quot;This is the blandest island and the pictures are going to be
fug! Also it's late, it's hot, so yeah, like, let's reschedule. Maybe
even, I dunno, go see if we can go back to Dark Land?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Lemmy
seated closest to her had a double take. Running his hand through his
rainbow hair, he couldn't understand why she'd say that genuinely. He
glanced backwards at the wedding crowd for confirmation. Had no one
else caught 'Miss Perfect' Wendy actually disagreeing with her
father?</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;I
caught that,&quot; Iggy said to Lemmy uncannily, the first words
they'd shared since the morning after the 'incident'. He was seated a
row behind his brother. Lemmy spun to him as he continued, &quot;Lemmy
I need to tell you something.&quot; Iggy scratched the back of his
neck nervously as his brother became more bewildered and concerned.
&quot;Actually uh, I don't know how to put this but-&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Why
ARE we sitting around on our tails? We'll just be picked off like fly
guys!&quot; a large mook next to Iggy roared. A murmur of agreement
came from around them, increasing in volume by the second. No one
could hear their selves talk or think.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;YOU'RE
ALL RUINING MY WEDDING! AGAIN! Is there really a reason why I should
not marry Peach?! Right! There isn't!&quot; In rapid stomp mode
Bowser made torches fall and leveled the sand props.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Bowser,
you forgot about the most important objection!&quot; Peach yelled
over the commotion.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Bowser
stopped and looked her in the eyes earnestly, shaking in irritation.
&quot;What what what?!&quot; he cried.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Mine.
If you really care for me, you will know why.&quot; She boldly spun
on her heels and walked to the shore alone, leaving a vacuum in the
area. Bowser witnessed her strutting farther way, immobilized by some
abhorrent part of him that was intent to remind that he would always
be a loser, the third wheel between Peach and-</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Mario..&quot;
Bowser's bitter anger mellowed into deep sadness. He remained planted
in that spot, facing where Peach left.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Lemmy
instantly left Iggy to rush up to the foot of the altar. &quot;King
Dad, don't worry! Everyone is going to apologize and then we'll get
Peach back!&quot; he sputtered. He tugged on the closest sibling.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Wendy
turned bleached white seeing Bowser crumbling up there. All that
defiance from somewhere unknown drained away. &quot;Oh we HAVE to
make this up to daddy or we'll be ultra grounded. Come on then!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Far
enough on the shore to not be deafened by the Koopa Troop's
cacophony, Peach noticed a speck on the horizon. Attracted by the
torch Kamek had shining far up into the sky was an unmarked white
boat. With an enticing scent it sailed to the the short island dock.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Sentry
11 lurking in the shadows lowered his binoculars. &quot;Boss! Food
catering's here!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Who
wants those hot wings?!&quot; A speaker announced from inside the
motor craft. Dozens of the Koopa Troop stopped their screaming
matches and frantically waded over to the boat. They brushed beyond
Peach to where an unseen person loaded up their plates, hands,
napkins, empty shells, whatever, with wings, drumsticks, ribs, and
barbecue.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>While
the Koopalings were standing around trying to figure out where
everyone had went, an ice cold blue can labeled '3 Moons'
materialized in Bowser's hand.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;It's
on the House. Chug it, dad!&quot; Larry winked. The fools, they'd not
even noticed him stroll up at least until then. Roy promptly put him
in a painful neck lock.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Lemmy
gave a start. &quot;King Dad, read the label!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Bowser
crushed the empty can woozily. &quot;Three.. MOONs! Duh!... Urp.
Excuse me&hellip; 100% alcohol. 100% sugaarr...!&quot; His children
kept drifting away but in actuality he was wandering around and
stumbled into Peach at the shore. All he made out in the dark was the
red and blue of her flower necklace and so inebriated he couldn't bat
away another loathsome facet of himself coming to surface.
&quot;...Marrrio?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Excuse
me?&quot; she exclaimed.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;..You're
looking... hot!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Peach
side stepped when he lunged for a kiss. Bowser tumbled forward and
off the pier into the water. Peach slung off her high heels and
sprinted down the dock. She hurled herself onboard into the boat. The
interior was filled of high-tech radars, radios, and mounted weapons.
A young red capped toad dressed in all black at the controls spun his
chair around. Without a word passing between them he took action.
Their ship drifted away from Bowser Island as Peach remembered
something missing, as essential as a hand or foot. Toadsworth!
Despite very much buoyant she felt herself sinking down the deepest
depths of the ocean. It was too late to return to the island!</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>On
Bowser Island, Roy tossed his brother before the others like a rag
doll. Larry rolled to a stop on the raised altar area, his back
smashing against the sand podium. The Troop had dispersed due to
their surprise visitor and they were the only ones hanging around the
wedding spot. Larry spat out some blood as he crawled back up under
the furious glares of his brothers and sister. &quot;...Heck YEEEAHH,
I PUNKED all y'all! You notice me now?!&quot; he screamed, voice
breaking. They could see the ship shrinking on the horizon.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Lemmy
tiny fists balled and shook, his face flushed over. He rushed up to
him, though he reached Larry's chin only. &quot;LARRY! WHY WOULD YOU
DO THIS?!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>&quot;Because
I've told you a million times and you don't freaking listen!&quot; he
screamed back into his face &quot;I don't wanna be a Koopa Troop!
Last month, after Mario came and beat us all up and we were aching
and miserable, I'd flippin' had it with this crap. I was gonna puke
if I had to sit around in World 1 and guard another fortress
pretending I actually cared. My grades have been dropping from
stress. Every professor notices and I can't tell them the real
reason. I was gonna run away and live somewhere else under disguise
or something and finish school and run an underground club- Don't ask
me how that was supposed to flippin' work, I had to just get out of
here!&quot; He panted under their stunned silence. He felt lighter
than air. A new wave came over him. &quot;But then Ludwig had his
latest new scheme. it seemed to be too much going on, so I thought I
could pretend just a little longer. Now I don't need to do I? So, if
you're expecting an apology I ain't got one. I'm happy we
just failed.&quot; He smirked then. &quot;Welcome to my world.&quot;</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;...Larry?&quot;
Wendy, Roy, and Morton exclaimed at once, even Junior if to fit in.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Lemmy
wearily stepped back. &quot;Everyone, stop! Stop!... Let's find King
Dad and then Larry we'll.. talk about that.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Lemmy-sama,&quot;
Iggy spoke up quietly. &quot;Maybe Larry-chan won't apologize, but as
I was trying to communicate to you before my eardrum was ruptured,
really I think you should.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Lemmy's
eyebrows furrowed. &quot;This is a bad time to joke around. What?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Iggy
rubbed his tired overly worked eyes behind his glasses. No more
beating around the bush or some other distraction would be around the
corner. He'd seen this situation before in too many TV shows.
&quot;Nevermind. Behold my!-&quot; he reached into his pocket and
presented in their faces a completed supped up gold pocket watch. It
opened to flashing circuitry that gleamed in the night. &quot;-Way
Awesome Intelligent Futuristic Utility! Is it familiar, Lemmy-sama?
It came from a place that was creepy but also an epic place for an
anime battle. A place where we-&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;-Yo,
excuse me but I can't get over the fact that you made a W.A.I.F.U!&quot;
Larry gave a snort.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Oh
gosh darn it Larry-chan,&quot; Iggy went in a sudden fit, &quot;now
you're the plot device that's gonna stall me out before I can explain
to the rest of them that Lemmy, Ludwig and I knew what was going on
the entire time and I've been building this invention to go back and
reset that Friday night where it started and we released the Dark
Star that's been attacking us!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Wendy
gasped, hurt in her eyes, then searing anger. Lemmy shrunk a few
inches. Morton, unnaturally silent, was shaking his head with a look
that seemed half pitying half someone else.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Roy
snatched Lemmy by edge of his shell behind his neck, dangling him. &quot;I
knew somethin' bout this situation stunk extra bad. Any more secrets,
pipsqueak? &quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Lemmy
gulped. &quot;N-no, I kept getting swamped by all of my
responsibilities. I would trying to think about it but it got harder
to accept the deeper we got into this. And then King Dad just kept
pushing us forward so... Yeah, I'm guilty. &quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Wrong
answer!... I mean, right answer! I mean-GAH! Get crushed!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Lemmy
then decided, not! He shot his legs up against Roy's hard abs, and
kicked do an acrobatic flip backwards out of his grasp. Lemmy
continued flipping off the alter and landed on his ball arms raised
and eyes closed, almost involuntarily shouting 'tada' for the perfect
landing. But then he opened his eyes and squealed. Roy was barreling
at him mach speed. He rolled away. Wendy entered the fray cussing him
out and Morton was running along as well. Lemmy fled to the beaches
where the Koopa Troop were lounging around obliviously. He called for
help and zig zagging around the soldiers for his life. He was
practically invisible to them. He wasn't a worthy substitute for
Ludwig all along. Maybe he should have taken a hint from Larry.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Iggy
stood at the X spot that marked where Kamek was to stand behind the
podium. It was as good a spot ever for his hail mary test run. All of
this drama was nothing for him really to worry about. It was his
least favorite genre, after 'western' and 'hurt/comfort', wait, wrong
application. But anyway due to two days straight of diligence he held
now in his palms another time machine! He was officially 'OP'. He
wound up the crown and let it go, bracing himself. Spring retention
slung the hands backwards, stopping time in the island's proximity
for ten seconds before it ran out of power. Time spun in in turbo
mode to catch up. The disturbance created a wave of water crashing
over the shore. Iggy took in a gulp of air while he could and thanked
himself for making the watch water resistant.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>By
then Larry had snuck away to the other half of the island when two
mooks emerged from behind some tropical vegetation and onto his path,
a koopatrol and toad. They were joking and laughing and eyelashes
were batting. Both shuddered at him.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Tanner
then saluted rigidly. &quot;Larry, sir! I was just showing a fellow
soldier all of the Prankster Comets known to circle in this
hemisphere, sir! And nothing else, sir!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Not
knowing what else to do, Emery copied what he did. &quot;Yep. No,
seriously!&quot; She turned then the Tanner. &quot;Wait, isn't he on
the traitor list? Shouldn't we like, do something?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Larry
folded his arms and laughed. &quot;Heh heh, from you toady? Miss
I'mma quit Peach's hospital and then join Bowser?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>Emery
frowned slightly, but kept saluting. &quot;I was fired,
not the same thing. Besides, didn't betray the princess because I was
ever really on her side.&quot;</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>Larry
kept chuckling giddily. &quot;Good point, toady. Guess I was never
really on Bowser's either. Let's pretend we didn't see each other,
'aight?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Larry
kept on through shallow water and to the closest island where it was
pitch black. This new independence was so fresh to him yet automatic.
He was imagining somewhere cool he could live next as a refugee, like
Neon Heights or Music Park. On reaching a new area he trampled fresh
vegetation and island flowers. There was another dock with something
waiting for him. Water Land's legendary canoe. He raced down and
grabbed the edge, pinching himself. It was real. Climbing onboard he
severed the rope keeping it tethered and drifted away, grabbing a set
of oars get further into water. He paddled around for a while until
he bumped something, his father's dazed body drifting around. He
panicked until he saw his father breathing. He pulled Bowser's body
on the legendary canoe and sighed. It was like Bowser still kept
track of him, even unconsciously. A giant wave slammed the boat then,
sweeping him right back towards Bowser Island, or what used to be.
The land mass disappeared as if a hurricane hit it. Bodies flailed
about everywhere, familiar ones. Larry snapped an oar in frustration.
He just couldn't get away from these people!</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Help!&quot;
Lemmy yelped desperately from a few feet away. Some debris, an extra
chain chomp chain caught his leg and was dragging him down.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Larry
glared at him hard, breathing heavily. A second later he reached his
arm out to help.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>...</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Mario
caused such a stir in the area he had to confirm he didn't
accidentally announce a new game. In spite of the hours growing later
the South was hectic. He wondered if they'd be as enthused if they
knew of the less than family friendly way it came to be, the
countless translucent blue scales the doctors forcibly scrapped off
of Ludwig's back. The screams of terror still echoed in his mind...
Mario kept the unfortunate koopaling's involvement secret, even from
his brother, explaining to others that he imported some at the last
minute to stifle questioning. Now the work was complete and
Sarasaland's young ruler was first to be cured. Daisy was laid into
an invention designed to emit a vapor on the subject. Mario guarded
the door again and only let a few in to watch this private and
discreet event, yet he suspected Buckenberry of live-streaming it
anyway...</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;If
this crazy thing launches into space or explodes, I'm gonna get you,&quot;
Luigi threatened.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Prof.
X-Naut calmed him with a thumbs up. There was a pop then a bang as
the inside of the chamber clouded up. After a few agonizing seconds
the doors were kicked open from the inside.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Did
you smoke bomb my bedroom? Again?&quot; Daisy wailed, flinging on to
Luigi, the nearest person, and rolling together to the ground.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Daisy,
yes you're okay!&quot; He embraced her as Mario, Yoshi, Buckenberry,
and Jr. Troopa gathered around.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;W-where
am I? What happened to the tennis game?&quot; the princess inquired.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Toad
Toad was next, wheeled inside the chambers to get his steam
treatment. Peach's loyal secretary stumbled right back out, fanning
away the mist.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Ha,
ha, who burnt that pizza, homeboys? We won the game, right?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>More
were cured one after the other. Those in coma like states would leave
the machine walking and talking with no seriously ill effects other
than losing track of the last three days.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>&quot;This
is almost going too well..&quot;
Dr. Toad whispered to his crew. &quot;Two days here and no health
inspectors? We didn't even have the correct paper work so it would
have been justified for once..&quot;</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Drew,
we've worked our butts off. Stop giving yourself grey hairs and
celebrate.&quot; Dr. Topper pat him on the shoulder.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Dr.
Goom in a rare moment nodded pleasantly for a shady goomba. &quot;At
last a favorable report might be obtained for our Special World
Hospital.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Ah
you think? Even after that controversial surgery on Tubba Blubba?&quot;
Prof. X-Naut thought nostalgically.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;-Morris
you were the one who screwed that up by swapping the wrong heart! And
don't say that too loud!&quot; Dr. Toad hissed.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Hate
to interrupt over there, but I think we're done doctors.&quot; Mario
waved from the other side of the lab. All of the sick patients were
taken care of and sent to the sea of spectators collecting their
loved ones. The news was already on the Toad Town message boards.
Mario then held up a select few, Luigi, Yoshi, Captain Toad, and fan
Buckenberry (actually uninvited) to divert to a quiet corn field.
Quickly he regretted that disserted location choice.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Luigi
stepped forward. &quot;Bro, what is going on? You've been weird since
that package with the scales arrived..&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Mario
shrugged. &quot;There was something about that package.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;It
got damaged in shipping? I told you to always pay the few coins more
for insurance, especially the way Parakarry rushes,&quot; Yoshi
lectured in jest.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>A
chuckle escaped the red plumber. &quot;No no, not that. Yoshi! I'm
serious! They came from Ludwig von Koopa. I took him out of jail and
he has something to tell us about what's going on with Bowser. &quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Mario
whistled. Ludwig very slowly, movement hindered by the bandages all
over his back, emerged from a row of the produce with a zombie like
gait. His face was overly puffy due to anesthetics wearing off and
eyes red. As he inched closer grimacing, Luigi, Yoshi, and
Buckenberry had an expression as though he was the Underchomp seeking
to take away all of their extra lives. The Captain on the other hand-</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Golly!
A Koopaling!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Ludwig
muttered curses against Mario and scuttled back into the field. Deep
in a mental fog from pain killers, the corn maze thwarted his mind
utterly. He smacked against dead end after dead end. A light switched
on and he could see his tall silhouette before his path. He spun to
face the light.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Captain
Toad then switched his headlamp on a lower setting. &quot;What were
you saying, sir?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Regarding
what, little toad?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>&quot;It's
Captain
Toad,
and it's regarding your information on Bowser.&quot;</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;That
intel is for Mario.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Fair,
Mr. Koopa. What about your special objects lexicon then, the book you
let Mr. Mario barrow? I had Hint Toad send me a complete PDF for my
own enjoyment and I was reading it for the last hour.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Sobering
up, Ludwig was intrigued of where this might go with the parvenu of
Mario and company, but that meant showing his hand to someone he'd
never met before. Still, the opportunity to converse with the only
other person who had read his book was too strong for the koopaling
to ignore. &quot;Reluctantly, I will elucidate. My father is in
danger of a threat called the Dark Star. Now that you have cured all
those I afflicted with Mushroom Flu, we must communicate this to them
and then hypnotize a way to mitigate its destructive and persistent
force.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>The
Captain nodded. &quot;But you know how already. It is in the very
book we speak of.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>The
koopaling frowned. &quot;Why do you speak as such? I have extracted
all particulars from those beige crinkly pages. Surely you don't
suggest I am a poor student!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;I
am afraid so, Mr. Koopa.&quot; He watched as The Captain fiddled with
his tool belt. Ludwig then caught the moonlight glint off of a shiny
blade. His mouth went dry as the toad added, &quot;And don't call me
Shirley.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Captain!&quot;
Ludwig gasped, his tender shell smacked against the stalks. He was
cornered.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Let
me quiz you. The star section of your book states this: 'Ownership
[of a star endued item] can pass on through physical possession or..'
What? What was the requirement?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>&quot;I
cannot recall,&quot; Ludwig mumbled defeatedly. He was certain he
knew it all. However despite the book being on him for days, the last
time he'd actually read it was that Friday night. Some sort of
subconscious trauma made him shy to thumb through it since.
Regardless he found this situation reprehensible. After his
'selfless' sacrifice of his back scales he was still being treated
like low life dirty Bowser mook by this toad pest. No one had to like
him but he could, deserved, be
respected. Masking it under indifference, he was going to test him in
return. To see if a Mushroomite raised under such speciest and
nationalistic tyranny could grasp that truth. &quot;I will say no
more, little toad.&quot;</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>Something
moved in a blur. Ludwig felt a painful sting on his left arm,
accompanied by thin line of blood running down from the cut. His
nostrils flared. &quot;Cease this game already,&quot; he growled,
clinching his arm. &quot;-Eldstar, why do I keep meeting the insane
ones?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>The
Captain seemed shocked for a flash, the first piece of evidence he
wasn't a sadistic toad shaped android. He then tried just as quickly
to hide that under a neutral veil. &quot;Perhaps I was in too jovial
a mood.&quot; He strapped away the knife, trading it for his more
signature pickaxe. &quot;The answer was 'death'. Death was the
alternate condition to rid oneself of any attachment, positive or
negative, to the stars. Since, if I understand correctly, the owner
of the Dark Star, or the item that spawned such is dead, that Dark
Star has no attachment to any one and is thus in a position to be
permanently conquered. This ends the cycle a dark star normally
experiences, that of attaching itself to someone with a psionic link
and influencing them for destruction until it is physically
separated, typically by being buried deep somewhere underground.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>&quot;Where
have I heard that before?&quot; Ignoring his injuries, Ludwig grabbed
him close. &quot;This IS the
missing piece!
The steward, Zoo Diddley. I respected his privacy, but I always knew
there was something about him that-&quot;</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Break
it up!&quot; Mario shouted, shining a blinding light on them both. He
was waving the other arm in the air like a maniac, but they could no
longer hear the rest of what he said, voice buried by the obnoxious
drone of a helicopter somewhere near.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>...Just
on the other side of the same field, &quot;-Cut it out already,&quot;
Dr. Toad groaned.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>He
and Jr. Troopa were entering the gates to the field that held the
Special Hospital's ride. While Jr. Troopa disliking Dr. Drew Toad was
no secret, the reason why was. Junior's colleagues assumed he had a
good explanation but he knew himself he didn't.
Junior typically had the endurance to annoy people indefinitely but
this time he was drained. That's what he got for starting a bitter
one-sided rivalry.</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Wake
up, Junior,&quot; Dr. Toad stopped where there packed up supplies
were held. Long propellers ahead were rapidly spinning up, flatting
out corn in the maze and whipping about his oversized lab jacket. It
became ear-splitting, so the toad doctor had to lean in towards his
ear.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Snapping
out of those thoughts, Jr. Troopa gave a curt nod and held on to his
cowboy hat. &quot;Yep, partner?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Ease
it down some! You do an excellent job to be so young! I mean it! But
stop being so clingy!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Jr.
Troopa blinked at him. &quot;What?!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;I
mean it! Hey, sorry I denied your request the first time. I was going
through things. I'll readd you if it makes you feel better!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>A
smile grew on Jr's face before he could stop it. &quot;Y-you will
partner?!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Yeah!
Soon as I'm back at my office computer... Assuming Morris hasn't
unplugged the wireless routers again!. Okay, associate? Farwell!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Jr.
Troopa watched the helicopter take flight, shortly becoming invisible
against a black sky speckled with stars. He fist pumped. He finally
would have a instant messaging friend that was close to his age, in
the medical field, and free of time wasting girlfriends! Not that he
cared about- never mind.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>...</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><p><p>&quot;So,
some 'historian' came to my castle one day and said he did free metal
detecting crap. He picked up something in my backyard and I was like,
yeah see what it is. That was a few weeks ago. Everyone I asked to
help agreed at first but then like, dawg, they when treasure crazy
over it, digging and digging!&quot; Daisy explained, seated on the
bed and hugged up in covers to suppress her constant chills, one of
the milder side effects. She continued, &quot;I felt so bad because
they just went bonkers.
I thought they'd dig through the planet until they stopped at a tomb.
It took dynamite to blast the sucker open and what was inside
vanished out of thin air. It was hard to see before going poof but I
think it was an old rusty bell..&quot;</span></span></font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p>
<p>Mario
nodded. &quot;I think our toads saw that item in the hands of Zoo
Diddley.&quot; He stood at the door while Luigi, Yoshi, and Toad
gravitated towards the back wall where the cowhide rug and seating
was. &quot;It gets worse, a mystery general of yours thought my line
was Bowser.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Daisy
slapped her head lightly. &quot;That's another crazy thang. He
invited himself around but I couldn't deal it because the tennis game
was coming up and-&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;-I
know, I know,&quot; Mario repeated. &quot;I screwed this all up by
scheduling that tennis game without thinking. All I cared about was
getting back at Bowser, making you collateral damage and I'm sorry.
Finally though, we've solved this mystery and this mess will be
over.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Really?&quot;
Luigi raised one eyebrow.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Yeah!
We know what to do, thanks to this.&quot; He revealed the Ex Spatio
Obiecti. &quot;But as if I know what I'm talking about. Let me get
someone so who does.&quot; He then surprised them by turning around
to the window in the room and sided it up with a loud creek. Someone
was standing outside they noticed then, covered in outerwear that
obscured their features.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Don't
freak out this time. It's Ludwig. He's wearing that so people don't
notice him.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Yoshi
stared at the figure. &quot;In a neon yellow poncho?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;And
why is he here roaming around here? You never got to that, Mario,&quot;
Luigi added, defensively standing near Daisy.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Attention!&quot;
Ludwig spoke at last. His poncho rustled as he slid close to the
cracked window pane. &quot;I know I am gaudy right now, don't rub it
in. Anyway-&quot; He explained everything he knew laconically but it
still look quite some time, concluding, one finger raised with, &quot;So
we need to combat a powerful force with an equal one. Crygor's Law of
Relevancy!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;...Can
you run that through me again?&quot; Toad asked with a burned out
look.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;NO!&quot;
everyone went.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Luigi
wearily plopped down in the room's standard issue La-Z-Boy. &quot;It
is a lot to take in though.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Take
your time,&quot; Ludwig said flatly. &quot;We only have very little
of it left...&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Mario
slipped on his shoes and grabbed a travel bag. &quot;We have to go go
go!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Luigi
watched him dash out. &quot;Mario! He's going jackrabbit again,&quot;
he told Yoshi and Toad.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Yoshi
sighed. &quot;Let's get him..&quot; He left with Toad.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Luigi
got up when he remembered Daisy. &quot;Daisy, you'll be okay? I'm not
sure what's about to happen right now honestly. I thought we were
near the other side of the tunnel honestly.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>The
desert princess gave a start. &quot;OH, did I zone out? Yeah. I just-
I know I'm supposed to be recovering but I'm worrying about my staff
and generals at the castle, and I'm outta minutes.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>He
returned to her side. &quot;Here, call home.&quot; He eagerly handed
her his phone.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Weegee,
you're the best. Just stick around. It'll be a sec.&quot; She hugged
him and then dialed her castle's front desk phone. Both of them
leaned over the bright screen while it rung. She didn't want her mind
to go there, but being alone in the room for the moment was intimate
in a way she hadn't felt with him in a while. She wasn't sure if the
heat on her face was from that or her low-grade fever. &quot;Hey,
this is your Princess Daisy.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Oh,
princess!?&quot; the unfamiliar lady on the other end exclaimed. &quot;I'm
Nass your new in house nurse and assistant.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Daisy
rolled her eyes. One would think she left the doors of her castle
wide open with how many unwanted guests it was attracting these days.
Actually maybe she did do that sometimes- &quot;Just let me speak to
whoever's your superior...&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>The
nurse switched the line. &quot;HELLO? ARE YOU BACK FROM 'TENNIS' SO
SOON, PRINCESS?&quot; the English voice bellowed. &quot;YOUR AFFAIRS
HERE ARE AS SMOOTH AS A WELL OILED MACHINE. DO NOT WORRY ABOUT A
THING.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Daisy
flushed angrily. &quot;What the heck is this? Freakin' jerk! Get out
of my castle! Where is Ming? I'll only trust him at this point.
Straight up. In fact slick, I don't care how crappy I feel! I'm about
to fix a flight home right now and kick you out personally. How 'bout
that?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;HAHAHAHAHA.
GET ON MY LEVEL, MORTAL. TA TA.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Luigi's
violently emitted a black mist from the speaker holes. They jumped
off the bed as it sizzled and the plastic melted into a charred lump,
burning through the mattress and down into the wood flooring. A fire
alarm blared. Daisy clung to Luigi, wrapping her arms around his back
and watched over his shoulder.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Oh
gods! Sorry Luigi did I hit a wrong button or?.. I hope your private
pictures of tropical beaches were.. 'backed up in the clouds'?
Whatever that means.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Luigi
turned around and pulled her close, drawing them away from the mess.
&quot;I'm just glad you're okay. What if whatever this was is
connected to that Dark Star? We have to find everyone.. And apologize
to the room service.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>They
sprinted outside, both very disoriented of where anything was in this
Southern park of the Mushroom Kingdom. They split up to see who would
find a phone booth or source of help first. Luigi went to the left
where eventually along the road was a golf kart inexplicably parked
there. &quot;Yo, Green! Where's Mario? I wasn't snooping or anything
but me and that ol' Mitch and I found out-&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Luigi
swung into passenger seat with Kylie Koopa &quot;You can tell me the
scoop later. Get a fire wagon! My phone blew up!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Nice!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Luigi
gave the koopa a tired vexing look. &quot;Not in popularity..&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>...</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Mario
ducked under the hanging model airplanes in Jr. Troopa's private
office. The head nurse healed up a mysterious cut on Ludwig here
after they met in that corn field. Mario didn't know why, but Junior
was in a mighty good mood and let him stay there, at least until
Mario snuck him back out to talk with his friends. Mario approached
the corner near Junior's computer where Ludwig had jot impressively
for a few minutes. &quot;Darn, it's in German.&quot; He flipped from
page to page worriedly, comparing them to the Lexicon.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Want
me to get Toadette to translate it?&quot; Buckenberry asked over his
shoulder.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Mario
jumped. &quot;Cool Blue?! I thought you went back to the castle with
the rest.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>The
young blue toad shrugged. &quot;I was waiting for Yoshi cause he'll
need a ride. So do ya? Wait, Mario that is in English, just neat
cursive.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Mario
pulled his hat down over his eyes some, blushing. &quot;I knew that..
Then what does it say?&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>He
squint at it and then smiled apologetically. &quot;Never mind. I
still can't read it.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>The
Koopaling hobbled in at last, dropping that hideous poncho as he hit
the door. He found amusing their buffoon like expressions sh he eased
into Junior's La-Z-Boy. Again, those things littered the south.. &quot;You
would have never understood Mario fiends, it's in neat cursive
German! There are star endued objects that can assist in the
incorporeal warfare we find ourselves in, so cease disorganizing my
journal please.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Hey!&quot;
Buckenberry tugged on Mario. &quot;Saturday when we were cleaning up
the castle, Alagold told Toadette to salvage a jewel of Peach's.
Today we put it in storage down here. That's totally it I mean it has
star in the name, right? She studied this in college.&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Ludwig
spat out his hot tea. &quot;We must possess that instantaneously!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Mario
visited a store building that had been rented to them, housing random
things from the toads for convenience, clothes, valuables from the
castle, some powerup items, the green Bowser racket Luigi added
there, and more. Buckenberry pointed out the shoe box. They brought
it back to Ludwig and together opened it up. It's light filled the
dim little room and the pink hued diamond shaped gem had a
magnetizing pull. Ludwig was leaning in, and then recoiled quickly,
blue eyes sparking in some sudden realization.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Plumber
and little toad,&quot; he explained urgently. &quot;We are not the
'owner' so it is important that we do not touch it.&quot; He watched
them not react to his words, growing closer. With a shudder, he had
to get up and stop them. The knocked back the blue toad but was too
late for his greatest rival. &quot;Mario!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Mario's
head snapped upwards. &quot;What, Ludwig?&quot; he asked, casually
holding the gem.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Ludwig
paused with bated breath. Maybe it didn't mean- Oh, never mind he
corrected. It did, as Mario let the gem slip back into the box. The
plumber's mouth hung open in horror.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>...</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>The
next wave hit the boat so hard Peach would have flipped out was she
not already buried under all of the equipment that shook off their
mounts and toppled over her. Agent Toad or Sonny as he casually
introduced himself, fought to keep them on top of the waves. The down
pour beat them down like a waterfall and she couldn't discern a
direction they were trudging, only a light source behind thickened
fog. Another splash shook her up again, bringing to the top of the
pile a warp whistle. Immediately she tried to use such, but
waterlogged it made no noise.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Mayday!&quot;
Agent Toad yelled over the winds of the typhoon. He donned complete
scuba gear in flash. &quot;Mmm mm mm mm?&quot; He lifted the snorkel
up. &quot;Sorry. Do you think you could swim to the nearest continent
from here? No? I'll do what I can but uh I'm kind of new on the job
and-&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>There
was another crash as the object following them with the light rammed
them. Hull breached by the large canoe, the their spy boat fell apart
in seconds. Peach grasped on to a paddle. It lifted her up and
onboard to a sight worse than the storm.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;I
found the princess!&quot; Lemmy and a few others hurried to get the
drenched and shivering princess and onboard. Iggy's flashlight was
the only light in the night storm. In her extreme fatigue she
couldn't make out any faces and fell unconscious.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Row
row row,&quot; koopas droned, a drilled in habit if they didn't want
fire breathed on them, even doing so when their king wasn't actually
conscious to force them to do anything. Bowser was just as motionless
as Princess Peach as the legendary Water Land canoe rocked with the
waves. None of the koopalings were making eye contact with each other
and trying to stay alive remained a good excuse to not talk about
much either.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Lemmy
clambered to the edge of the bow. He caught one glimpse of land
before getting pummeled by a wave with the force of K64 running late.
He fell back into the puddle in the middle of the boat, continually
growing in size as they took on more water. Facing upwards into the
sky, Lemmy spotted with each flash of lightning a swirling vortex in
the rain clouds. &quot;Over there!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>Kamek
nodded and directed a new course, clinging to the edge for support
with his hood far down over his head. Suddenly Wendy O. the self
proclaimed queen of the ocean tossed a sparkling gold ring in the
water from the edge. For a moment the storm began to calm down, the
waves moving more gently.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Told
you I had this under control,&quot; she murmured.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>A
steady but comparatively soothing rain pattered the boat. Larry
grumbled something then. Toadsworth was next to him in the same
position, but dissonantly relieved that the princess had survived
shipwreck. Her wellbeing was all he hoped for anymore. Kammy leaned
over the edge of the ship and mentioned seeing something just like
time Bowser's shower got clogged. Lemmy got to the look out position
again to investigate.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Whirlpooooooooool!&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>All
one hundred of the Koopa Troop braced themselves as the strong outer
currant listed the ship to its side, ejecting many into the water.
The boat spun around until in the center of the eye it snapped in
half. All remaining were dragged down by the tidal currents, unable
to battle against it. Lemmy was a strong swimmer which he for once in
his life hated. He witnessed himself become the last man above the
water. He vowed if he survived he would never lie again. He never
meant to hurt anyone and all he could wish for was a chance to fix
this, as impossible as it seemed. The time came shortly when his
strength ran out. He took deep breath and closed his eyes before the
whirlpool devoured him.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p>
<p>&quot;REWARD
BESTOWED,&quot; boomed a satisfied voice from above.</span></font></font></font></p>
