truly was more than he expected, of soldiers smart enough to read the
sign posted on his castle's crumbling front doors, Bowser returned to
the spiraling landmark tower. It rose into another portion of the
kingdom he was yet to grace with his presence. Bowser climbed inside
a puny airship for a solo trip with only himself and this thoughts of
how all his troubles were Mario's fault. Somehow it always came back

a thunder effect to add the cherry on top of that haunting tale.

The rainbow haired koopaling paused and fidgeted in place, unable to
fix his gaze on anyone in particular. Without a formal meeting, he
Ludwig and Iggy silently agreed to not speak about anything. It
wasn't just to not look bad, at least they assured themselves. Ludwig
for instance insisted something 'bizarre' happened, additional
descriptors uncharacteristically escaping him, while viewing video
capture on Larry's laptop. Footage from Iggy rather, who had no
recollection of what he'd recorded from Peach's floating castle.
Lemmy had nothing to do with anything, too occupied all of yesterday
making sure their other siblings cooperated with Ludwig's scheme. It
seemed all to easy to detach himself, somewhat, from the predicament.
All connected to Zoo and his weird item they saw fleetingly before
disaster. Problem was, he was gone.</span></font></font></font></p>

pretended to not listen. He kept waving formations for the
paratroopas above to perform advance maneuvers. He was to invade the
castle with a squad Bowser selected for him, just as he begged for.
It embarrassingly took five minutes for him to realize they were
spelling out the name of his last ex girlfriend and so he yelled at
them the rest of the time. Junior was leaning on his elbows airily
looking down from the tower and watching little Bowser mooks below
move around like insects. To the six year old they'd be returning
home anytime soon. This was like an extension of Koopa Scouts,
practically the same thing! The constant moving around, sleeping
outside, people screaming, frequent injuries, and leadership
mismanagement to the extent the kindergartener could understand. He
didn't know what the big deal was. Wondering how scouting skills
could help, he tipped toed off 'secretly'.</span></font></font></font></p>

Anxious she was still in the hot bench over alluding to be associated
with the group that kicked her family out of their own kingdom, she'd
been busy with something. After scrolling around she found it and got
up. &quot;Look at this, it's all over Facebook now that we left Dark

north boarder felt on edge spotting the intruder drawing closer to
the newly erected gate. He readied his spear, the first line of
defense for the new 'Dark' Land, Sky Land. Tanner almost regretted
volunteering for the perilous duty. It was spontaneously because he
needed some distraction from the recent avalanche of problems aching
his heart. On top of the pile he hated to admit was losing his friend
Zoo. The dark boo's house was reported destroyed and his friend never
missed a day of work. Plus he was telepathic for crying out loud,
closeted or not. He would not have missed the mental 'pinging' his
friend would have surely sent if lost or hurt somewhere. So it was
pretty conclusive.. Second on the pile was whatever happened to his
latest friend, that new new toad girl minion. They occasionally had a
Mushroom Kingdomite cross over to the Dark Land side, but they were

fifty or more fellow dinos after him. Most of his neighbors were
young and insular, literally. Being Mario's pal or another other

to protect him. He could loose it all, his treehouse, his dog. He
needed help quick. Help like- Mario! A mile through the forest he
found a train passing through at a crossing and flutter jumped into a
musty car, landing in a pile of hay. He spat out the twigs and
examined his surroundings, old props and banners saying 'Emerald

was known as Dr. Koopa to Peach as a little girl. I got shafted by
her father. Kicked to the curb. Over paranoia. I quickly became Prof.
Koopa to a young adult Bowser, obtaining all sorts of free reign to
press science further. Things were booming in Dark Land. The army was
growing, there was a large city to be built nearby. Then the Mushroom
Flu broke out. Ah. What a coincidence. Progress hit a brick wall
until, well, you know about the old good doctor's deeds. There is a
rumor to this day that they tried to kill Dark Land's budding kingdom
off back then. Who would be so heartless to attack a koopa king with
one son and a pregnant wife with their second? The new one's name was
gonna be Lemmy-&quot;</span></font></font></font></p>

Larry's help, but again she silenced it. There was a time and place,
after all the land was beautiful and vibrant if one ignored Bowser
dumping it up. Larry cruised away from the tower and they were
turning heads where ever they rolled in the grass, as there were no
streets built yet just pure lush fields. Larry increased speed as he
drove by a new fortress build site. Morton handled the blue prints
with his remarkable speed reading. One glance and he'd memorized all
the details from the size of a bolt to the slab of concrete needed.

on the ground, Larry continued to flee from the horde as the weather,
explicitly wind but so thick it was like a mist, aggravated until he
could hardly see. Bowser Junior dropped a banana peel through the
sunroof which slipped up Lemmy and caused a small pile up. They burst
through a wooden boarder to some adjacent kingdom. Peach was
terrified but hopeful. But mostly her eyes were closed. Toadsworth in
the bench seats noticed someone's brandy in the drawer of the limo.
He took a sip, then two, then three and suddenly this was a run ride!
Now they were reaching forest with no accompanying path for the car.
That didn't stop Larry though, he'd never win backwoods drag races if
he paid attention to 'safety'. What stopped him instead was an object
causing the limousine bump off of something, hydroplane and then get
wedged in a tree tilted upwards. The car shook violently for a minute
in the mist and then it was over as they only caught a fringe of
whatever terrible storm happened. The area around them brightened up
quickly. The land was as flat and barren as Dark Land. All of
Bowser's minion's work was ruined, the fortress crumbled, the tower
was damaged heavily, and in the skies above the castle had taken a
brunt of the hit and only the foundation was left in the clouds.
Bowser himself was still flailing in the sky. He curled up
