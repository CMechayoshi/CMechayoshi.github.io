Forever 2</strong></p>
<p>'<strong>The Enemy' (Chapter 1)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Preface: Mario and Bowser, eternal enemies, rivals, and
more before a single pivotal decision splits their lives and the
world in two. Can they make another one to fix it or is it all too
far gone?...</strong></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/>

<p><em>Zoom</em>! A mushroom powered racer lifts off a ramp to clear
the one-thousand foot drop below. <em>Screech</em>! The racer in
eighth overshoots a tight curve. Sparks fly from the metal rails
separating them from death. The racer directly behind misses even
that and Lakitu rushes to 'fish' them to safety. The first place
racer uses their Koopa Troopa shells to block the perfectly aimed red
shell barrage from the disgruntled second place racer.~</p>
<p>This was a Mario Kart race where a group of heroes, villains, and
those somewhere in between routinely took it to the streets, the dirt
tracks, the underwater tracks, sand paths, snow piles, and whatever
Cheese Land is supposed to be to win the gold. On this day as the
start of a recreation weekend, the race took place on the spacey
Rainbow Road. Calming music played and comets darted through the dark
sky. It would almost be easy to miss fierce rivalries at every turn..</p>
<p>&quot;Finally I caught up with ya, moustache..&quot; King Bowser
Koopa growled as he trailed a few yards behind Mario in his kart. His
massive clawed hands gripped the steering wheel tighter in
concentration. He'd fought his way up from the pack and not even his
low acceleration was going to stop him.</p>
<p>Gentle wind blew through Mario's hair and mustache as he cooly
held the lead in the final lap. He lived for the thrill and would
host these death defying events everyday if he could. (In fact he had
for a moment but then all of his friends protested outside his house,
so that was cut short real soon.) The next item box gifted him a
single banana, immediately deployed behind his kart as he saw Bowser
approaching in his rear view.</p>
<p>&quot;Now you can't ignore me, plumber boy!&quot; Bowser pulled up
parallel, and so he and Mario took turns glaring at each other for a
half second before bringing their attention back to the daring
terrain. &quot;Just wait until I get a Super Leaf!&quot; Bowser
veered into Mario's path, bumping the plumber almost off the edge.</p>
<p>Mario tried to retaliate but Bowser didn't bulge from the middle
of the road. &quot;Gained some pounds? You know that item's only in
Mario Kart 7, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Like I care what blasted game this is! Gahh!&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser veered over again and Mario had to tap the breaks, allowing
the third place racer to come up. With unusual speed Toad zoom past
Mario and Bowser. Ahead of them and right before a anti-gravity loop
in the stage, the thundercloud trailing the mushroom retainer went
off. <em>Zap</em>! In a blinding flash Toad was shrunk, letting Mario
and Bowser overtake his spot.</p>
<p>&quot;Good riddance. These losers were starting to get too much
narration,&quot; Bowser said. &quot;This is about OUR rivalry. Now
watch this. I've done all of the calculations and this will hit you
smack in that stupid round face!&quot; Bowser tossed a shell at the
wall before the loop but it bounced back and instead hit someone way
behind him.</p>
<p>&quot;Daddy! Whhhhy?&quot; someone that sounded like Bowser Junior
screeched.</p>
<p>Nervously whistling, Bowser pretended he didn't hear that. Still
neck and neck with his rival, they went on the anti gravity loop
around, the last one before the finish. They heard Yoshi catching up,
then many other racers when catastrophe stuck! With a clap of thunder
everyone was shrunken now, even the twelfth place racer. How could
this happen? Well actually far up in the heavens, even farther than
Rainbow Road, the Great Eldstar's pager went off, a way to relay that
their known Mushroom World needed attention somehow.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Strike? Y/N</em>?&quot; the flickering screen of the
fate altering device conveyed. Before the ancient star could answer,
the pager vibrated off his counter top to the white marble floors
with such a loud clack that he also dropped the star shard he was
polishing. The priceless artifact made more noise and now he'd surely
woken everyone up in the Star Temple.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Twink's childlike voice echoed from
across the hall. The star child had company as a few other stars,
guardians of the world for the pure hearted, poured into the cramped
space.</p>
<p>&quot;All is fine,&quot; Klevar spoke first, ancient books for
study tucked under his arms. &quot;There was a Mario Kart scheduled
today and the Great Eldstar must consider the plead for his power
carefully...&quot;</p>
<p>Eldstar nodded but retrieving the interstellar communication
device he didn't bother to correct Klevar with the fact that he
always auto replied 'yes'. It was just easier that way. What could go
wrong?</p>
<p>The race continued just yards from the finish, but in fun size!
Eleven racers, Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, Peach, Toad, Bowser, Donkey Kong,
Koopa, Toadette, Junior, and Birdo were in one massive group with all
the same stats. Condolences to anyone who spent many coins on a high
tier list max speed load out. They bumped each other relentlessly and
a few racers even fell off. Mario pushed the pedal to the metal at
the opening for first. Bowser saw this and slammed the gas as well.
The finish line was only a few meters away and the two gunned it past
all remaining racers. Both hero and villain crossed the line in
miniature form.</p>
<p>Later and normal sized, the eleven racers eagerly gathered around
in the an open garage like area Rainbow Road had to see their final
score.</p>
<p>&quot;Dfkd s flksdj f lksdfe wr!&quot; Toad spoke to everyone who
was getting restless. Getting lightning attacked twice, he was
twitching a lot and everyone stood back.</p>
<p>&quot;Keep your pants on, alright? I finally got this junk to
work,&quot; Lakitu grumbled behind the dusty laptop. &quot;Third
place Yoshi. Second&hellip; Toad by some miracle.&quot; Lakitu paused
for a while before reading the final result on screen, counting over
and over on his little fingers.</p>
<p>&quot;WHO WON ALREADY?!&quot; several racers shouted.</p>
<p>Lakitu rolled his eyes, ready to quit forever. &quot;First place
in the cup with the highest score is&hellip;.Mario-&quot;</p>
<p>Mario jumped in the air in triumph.</p>
<p>&quot;-and Bowser with a score of fifty points. The rest of you?
You lose, go home!&quot;</p>
<p>Mario landed on the ground wide eyed as everyone else dispersed.
Baffled beyond belief he had no clue how this happened. He came up
with this sport based on his brief experiences as a taxi driver and
knew the game well. There could not be two winners, if so no one
really won!</p>
<p>&quot;Umm, excuse me?&quot; Mario spoke up to Lakitu who ignored
him.</p>
<p>&quot;Get over there!&quot; Bowser cut him off. &quot;I don't
count this as a win either. Me sharing the trophy with you? Gross.
But, uh, I'll keep it safe for ya.&quot; He held fake gold trophy
close to himself dearly.</p>
<p>&quot;Keep it koopa since you're already breathing all over it.
Let's have a rematch right after this week's sports. My tennis game
with Luigi is tomorrow but after that we can duel. Deal?&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser flashed his sharp teeth in an expression that could vaguely
be described as a smile.&quot;You're on!.. Oh, the brats are here to
pick me and Junior up,&quot; he added as a massive koopa airship was
approaching above. Bowser looked around. The lobby had soda machines
of several sorts and stale candy under a hood. &quot;I'm getting a
drink, want something?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm on a diet.&quot; Of course the plumber wasn't, and
Bowser staring through him let him know the deflection failed.</p>
<p>Bowser instead guffawed. &quot;Yeah right! Since one of us here
isn't fat, spare me a few coins. A want a Morel Moxie and I left my
wallet in my other shell.&quot;</p>
<p>Mario begrudgingly dug in his pocket to see what he had, noting
how quickly everyone had left. His friends sure knew how to hustle
away after a sports game. He had lint, a paper clip, and three coins.
&quot;Where is everyone?&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser flashed him that 'grin' again. &quot;Dunno. What's stopping
you from joining 'em? I'm the one stuck here waiting here for my
ride. You could have left anytime but I know, I'm irresistible. Ha!
Why don't you tell the princess that too sometime?&quot;</p>
<p>Mario face palm so that he didn't see the shadow of the anchor
from Bowser's doomship on the ground and swinging right over his
head. Right as Bowser was slipping the coins in a machine, the heavy
steel anchor made a sudden drop. <em>Bam</em>! There was another wipe
out, but it wasn't on the track this time. Mario was now sprawled out
on the ground, knocked out cold&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Keep your friends close, enemies closer. That motto the plumber
took to heart whether racing to save the world and save the princess
or casually go-karting with Bowser. Either way '<em>the enemy</em>'
stayed under close watch visually and audibly. The two spoke nearly
everyday, if only just to make sure the koopa had nothing up his
sleeves! The fight against 'the enemy' never stopped and so Mario
never stopped- Unless he had a mild concussion&hellip;</p>
<p>After a six hour stay at the Sky Land ER, Mario was discharged and
told to rest and take his aspirin. Before leaving a traumatized
looking nurse handed him a special discharge letter from a 'pal'.</p>
<p><em>To Mario: This is Bowser. Yeah my koopaling brats don't really
have a license to drive the airship. Whoops! I guess they were
rushing because Junior has a Koopa Scouts trip to go on tonight.
Anyway I'll make it up to you, especially since my kids are driving
me crazy these days. How? I'll be your tennis partner tomorrow!
Genius right? Cause then you'll actually win and that'll mean I will
win! Luigi can sit on the bleachers. I changed the forms and
everything already by [the word 'threatening' is scratched out]
'explaining' the situation to Lakitu. Get ready!</em></p>
<p><em>PS. This isn't a ploy to get my very own medal for once or
anything.. Btw, our shared trophy is still safe and under my watchful
care!</em></p>

<p>Luigi groggily leaned up and bed and stretched while Mario snored
loudly on the other side of the room buried in covers. This was
typical when back-to-back weekend events were scheduled. Mario would
sleep a few minutes longer and somehow, to Luigi at least, he'd gain
twice as much energy for the day because of it. Luigi wished he could
use that tactic but he couldn't ignore a blaring alarm like his
brother could. He stared at the darkness for a moment when Mario's
cellphone, a basic Yoshimobile identical to his own, rung on the
nightstand. Luigi checked the caller id.</p>
<p>&quot;Bowser?!&quot; he gasped.</p>
<p>&quot;Booowzer...&quot; Mario mumbled, tangling himself in the
sheets.</p>
<p>Luigi jumped on Mario's bed and shook him violently. &quot;Bro
wakeup wakeup it's Bowser calling! WAKE UP WAKE UP WAKE UP!&quot;</p>
<p>'<em>You have one new message.'*Beep*</em></p>
<p>Mario's eyelids slowly open as the voicemail began to play:</p>
<p>&quot;Hey pipes for brains, wake up call! Bwa ha ha!&quot; A loud
'Koopa Symphony' was in the background of Bowser's voice, being so
loud as to go through thick walls. &quot;Friendly reminder for ya: we
gotta win, or else! ...Oh and tell the Princess I'll be looking my
best just for her!&quot;</p>
<p>Mario rolled his eyes. Luigi didn't notice over the clacking of
his own teeth.</p>
<p>&quot;Lastly. Umm, well. What's the recipe for that Couples Cake
again?... You know, the one only friends eat together? *Mumbling
noises were heard*- Kamek, no this isn't Mario- *mumbling noises*
Umm, gotta go. Keep that touchscreen smokin'! That's what phones use
now right? See ya, plumber breath.&quot;</p>
<p><em>*Beep* 'End of message. You have no new messages.' </em>
</p>
<p>Mario slowly craned Luigi's way, knowing he'd screwed up when his
brother sat on the bed slumping. &quot;Listen, I didn't know Bowser
took your name off the board until yesterday.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just forget it. My tennis elbow's been acting up anyway.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't say that. I would have told you when I got home from
Sky Land-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;About that, are you feeling aright?&quot; Luigi asked all a
sudden. He was nearly in bed by the time Mario returned yesterday and
didn't perceive much other than the word 'concussion' before he was
too sleepy to think about it.</p>
<p>&quot;Just a small headache. Little bro, I promise this whole
thing won't happen again.. <em>Bros before koopas,</em> right?&quot;
Mario really meant it, but he couldn't tell if his brother realized
it when he left the bedroom without a response. Now what did he say
wrong?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&quot;Bowser kicked you off the roster and so now you're just
gonna spectate today?&quot; Toad repeated to be sure. The twitchy
subordinate of the princess ran a concession stand in front of the
tennis stadium among others. It was sunny in Toad Town with crowds
already starting to gather for the tournament. Toad had a glass tip
jar half full of shiny coins testifying to the fact that he was the
most successful of the vendors selling useless junk.</p>
<p>&quot;You heard me right,&quot; Luigi replied. &quot;Do you have a
chill? You've been jittery since yesterday.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll live. Wanna try a shroom shake?&quot; Toad held up a
pitcher full of something pale blue. The other flavor was yellow.</p>
<p>&quot;What flavor is that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My favorite, homeboy. Purple flavor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But that's blue.&quot;</p>
<p>Toad shrugged. &quot;Stop being picky. You're already the player
two option so don't be a jerk too!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay okay! I'll try it!&quot; Well, he didn't want to be
jerk did he? So Luigi took a sip, tasting a flavor explosion of every
fruit except blueberry. While his head was tilted up Mario snuck up
on him and poked him in the back. In alarm Luigi sprayed juice all
over himself and Toad's stand.</p>
<p>&quot;Get lost!&quot; Luigi lashed out.</p>
<p>Mario tried to apologize but Princess Peach, ruler of the Kingdom
came along just in time to whisk him away. As far as Luigi was
concerned, that was good.</p>
<p>Toad was looking at how his yellow cups were now green due to
Luigi spitting blue juice. &quot;Whoa. You just made a new favor!
Thanks.&quot; Toad picked up a megaphone. &quot;SHROOM SHAKES 50%
OFF! TRY MY NEW 'LUIGI' FLAVOR!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think people should drink that, but I have to go.&quot;
Luigi really itched to sit down and see the game. Seeing Bowser in
his spot wasn't going to be the hard part, it would be resisting the
urge to root for Daisy, when ever she chose to show up. He and the
Sarasaland ruler talked a lot, but kept it down low. He let the
general rush of the audience get past him first and curiously someone
else was doing the same.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, I haven't seen you since Mario Party- whatever number
we're on! Do you still play tennis with that mean curve?&quot; Luigi
asked the boo diddly who gazed back bashfully.</p>
<p>&quot;Luigi! I was just thinking about you, hehe!&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile Yoshi arrived from the bus. The bus system was new to
Toad Town in the recent decades along with cell towers and he
appreciated it, living isolated from most at Yoshi's Island and
otherwise having to rely on boat. Despite the inconvenience he always
supported anything Mario did. He hung up on the call he was having
with his fiancee Birdo, who stayed home mundanely or perhaps wisely.
Toad was packing up when he approached the stand.</p>
<p>&quot;Toad, how's Mario? Is he still going to play? I heard rumors
that Bowser rigged the match.&quot;</p>
<p>Toad busily stacked up cups and other materials as Yoshi read his
banner and dropped a few coins in the tip jar. He tried to support or
at least be neutral with everyone but he wondered deep down if it was
all just to avoid feeling irrelevant as the oldest hero still running
around with Mario and crew. He was older than the famous brothers,
the princess, even Bowser!</p>
<p>Toad lifted his head up from the overstuffed bag he was cramming
things in. &quot;I didn't see ya. Thanks you crazy dinosaur! Mario
seemed okay earlier so I guess Daisy and I will have to knock him out
a second time.&quot;</p>
<p>Yoshi's smile flattened and his tail lowered, not finding it
funny.</p>
<p>&quot;What? Too soon? Here, try a freebie.&quot;</p>
<p>Yoshi received the green drink. After a sip or two, he slurped it
all up. &quot;Hmm. I like it but why does this taste like Luigi?..&quot;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>To be literate was a marvelous thing. Accurate communication was
the cornerstone of advanced civilization, even if attributing that
label to Dark Land was a stretch. Ludwig Von Koopa would know as the
land's prince and commander in chief. 'Reprisal in A minor', his very
own masterpiece, played from the closed up auditorium room of
Bowser's Castle and he stood outside listening. At least one sibling
had great taste. The music stopped suddenly and Lemmy kicked open the
door, smacking Ludwig in the face.</p>
<p>&quot;Oops! I didn't see you there.&quot; The younger koopaling
juggled five bowling pins and was his junior by almost two years. &quot;I
love blasting music, especially your stuff. You didn't tell me your
hit was on the Top 40 pop station.&quot;</p>
<p>Ludwig held the knot on his snout. &quot;I told the record company
I only wanted the adult contemporary- Oh forget that. Since you are
here I need my radio back, thank you.&quot;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Ludwig tuned in to WMUSH for local Toad Town news. The sports
coverage was coming right up and while he hated sports if board games
didn't count he wouldn't miss it this time.</p>
<p>Bowser threw another dart at Mario. The metal tipped barb dug in
an inch deep, straight in Mario's nose. Crudely taped to a wall in
the dark locker room with most of the bulbs out was a tattered 36x24
poster of Mario doing a 'v' sign, speckled with innumerable tiny
holes.</p>
<p>&quot;Aww, you own posters of me!&quot; Mario watched Bowser
assault that poster for thirty seconds, long enough to notice that
Bowser's red hair gelled back and a nice smell overall.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, AND?!&quot; Bowser retorted, jolting Mario from his
stare. &quot;These are for motivation to wipe the floor with you in
real life. I've been in here for like an hour and I've warmed up.
Whatta bout you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I got plenty of warm up. A reporter from the Mushroom Press
flagged me for an interview, I ran across a hot dog stand inside of
the stadium, I spoke to Princess Peach in the umpire area and then-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That ain't exercise!&quot;</p>
<p>Mario walked around in a circle. &quot;Guess again. The hotdog guy
was packing up and I had to chase him down.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So much for that fake diet, eh?&quot; Bowser smirked.</p>
<p>Mario smiled back. &quot;Clever koopa. What's our game plan?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hit the ball hard! Also&hellip; don't suck!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure. We'll do it your way. Just this one time.&quot; A
great opportunity to get to know 'the enemy' better so that he can be
crushed later, he reasoned.</p>
<p>It clicked in Bowser's head that they were smiling at each other
for too long so it contort into a scowl. &quot;Exactly moustache.
Here's my next tip just for you: have some equipment! Where's your
racket? You ain't playing with that are you?&quot;</p>
<p>Mario held out his signature 'M' tennis racket, burnt black from
years of his fireball power shots. He swung in the air a few times,
testing his grip. &quot;Why not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your crappy tennis racket is toast. Literally! I could put
it on bread.&quot;</p>
<p>Mario noticed some black crumbly bits stuck to his glove and
quickly hid the racket behind his back before Bowser could see. &quot;So
maybe it's well used, but everyone knows you have speed problems on
the field so it evens out.&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser snatched him up by his collar. Mario flailed as his boots
dangle above the ground several feet. Who would be daft enough to
pulverize their own tennis partner minutes before the game? Bowser
apparently! But then the doors of the locker room opened just wide
enough to let the outdoors light bleed in and shine on Bowser. It was
Toad.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't see!&quot; Bowser yelled, shielding his face and
dropping the plumber with a cracking noise.</p>
<p>&quot;Then we'll win even easier! Nice poster by the way!&quot;
Toad said while poking his head inside the room. The door shut and it
was just the two again.</p>
<p>&quot;Ugh... Fungusface,&quot; Bowser muttered under his breath,
&quot;Didn't we have this talk before about extra characters?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think a bad thing just happened..&quot; Mario got off his
butt. Thankfully- or not, the crack came from his racket in his back
pocket. It was in pieces. Each piece he grabbed shattered into
another before it soon reassemble a pile of charcoal.</p>
<p>Bowser with a sigh punched a locker. The door popped open and let
his own ragged duffle bag hit the ground. &quot;This is just sad to
watch so stop crying. I'm gonna be nice because it might have sort of
kind of been my fault, but mostly 'cause we need to play. Here!&quot;</p>
<p>He gave Mario a spare green tennis racket which otherwise
resembled Bowser's purple one, down even to the red menacing Bowser
emblem on it. Its balance was different but Mario tried to test it
out as Bowser observed. &quot;Different flex than I'm used to, but
thanks,&quot; Mario admitted, feeling weird about what he was saying.</p>
<p>&quot;Just try not to fall on your face, hear me? It's game time.&quot;
Bowser stomp toward the door like he was satisfied. &quot;Ahhg!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That stupid bright light again!&quot; Bowser growled as he
blindly stumble outside and bump into people in the sunlight.</p>
<p>Toad skipped back to his team's locker room in the same mood he
was always in. How could he not be? He got to live in the castle as a
manager, represent every toad ever in games, and play with Daisy who
always rejected his efforts to team until now. Daisy was sitting on
the benches doing something on her phone. The princess had on an
orange tank-top and shorts and her hair was tied back with a hair
band.</p>
<p>&quot;You ready Daisy?&quot;</p>
<p>Daisy continued to jab at at the touchscreen with hints of
frustration. &quot;Just remember the plan we discussed over the
phone.&quot;</p>
<p>Toad inched closer. &quot;Are you alright?&quot;</p>
<p>Daisy drop the phone on the bench, shedding the prickly exterior.
&quot;It's political stuff from back home. There was an excavation at
an old temple near my castle and since then it's just so different
there lately...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What? They got a gold rush?&quot; Toad guessed. He knew
little of her land though.</p>
<p>She shook her head. &quot;I can't even call it that. I posted
about it on my wall but Mario scheduled a game on this Friday
anyway!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Would you rather not play?&quot;</p>
<p>Daisy leaned back against the nearest grungy locker. &quot;I don't
wanna miss out on whooping them, I just think the others forget that
I live across the globe with other things to worry about sometimes.&quot;</p>
<p>He came up closer and almost put an arm around her, except he
backed out at the last minute from of shyness. &quot;I'm sure they
totally care about you. I care about you!.. Mario and the others were
probably just distracted or whatever. You know how much drama they
get in. Yeah, basic craziness for them.&quot;</p>
<p>Daisy faced his way, smiling for the first time. &quot;I guess
you're right. Thanks.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No problem-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;-And I fight for myself anyway,&quot; she remark proudly.</p>
<p>Right outside of locker room as the music was starting, they got
ambushed by a delivery guy with a baseball cap tilted down covering
his face and a low dry tone when he spoke briefly. He dropped off a
paper bag with two 12oz cans in it. He scramed so quickly the duo
hardly had time to recognize what happened or tell him thank you.
Daisy turned to her left to find Toad gulping his soda down
immediately. It was a can of Fungus Up, an expensive beverage and her
very own. Could it mean?- No it couldn't. But free was free.</p>
<p>&quot;You can't step on the field with a drink,&quot; Lakitu told
them, one of several gathering around as Mario and Bowser were
arriving from the other side to much excitement. A modest sized crowd
gathered in the all purpose outdoor stadium, intended to host small
sports events in Toad Town. The right side of the stadium had lots of
toads, bob-omb buddies, nokis, piantas, and other friendly species
but on the left however were koopa troop soldiers, bandits, thwomps,
and other enemies likely to root for Bowser.</p>
<p>Daisy gave the umpire an 'ok' symbol. She burped and then crushed
the can, the lemon-lime aftertaste still fresh.</p>
<p>&quot;YEEEAAAHHH DAISY!&quot; she suddenly did a triple back flip
and stuck the landing like a pro, exciting the crowd. Toad just ran
around in circles in a hyper way but it was enough to get their side
of the audience going.</p>
<p>&quot;Ladies and gentlemen...and Bowser!&quot; Lakitu and Bowser
exchanged nasty looks. &quot;In this doubles match we have Mario and
Bowser verses Princess Daisy and Toad!&quot;</p>
<p>Everyone was now into position. Toad and Bowser were hugging the
net and Daisy and Mario farther back. To Mario the competition seemed
fierce and both Toad and Daisy had developed a twitch, not unheard of
from Toad considering how often he got electrocuted, but very odd for
the princess. Even odder, Mario thought, was the slight foaming at
the mouth.</p>
<p><strong>Thwak</strong>!</p>
<p>The tennis ball hit Mario in the gut, bouncing off to the
sidelines. Laughter could be heard from the crowd.</p>
<p>&quot;Bed time's over, plumber boy! Wake up!&quot; Bowser growled.
His eyes had well adjusted to the light again by now and Mario could
almost feel his daggers.</p>
<p>&quot;For the LAST time, first serve Mario!&quot; Lakitu repeated.
Mario could have sworn it was never said a first time. Either way he
got up. It was game time.</p>

<p>Luigi settled in the nosebleed section with his friend, where he
liked it. The hike there was never fun but there was always room for
personal space.</p>
<p>&quot;What were you going by again?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Booigi the second because there's already a 'Booigi' out
there. But it's super cool to see you again, hehe. I just live in
Forever Forest now East of Toad Town.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm going to have to visit.&quot; Even if that place is
terrifying, Luigi added in his mind. A moment later his attention
drifted towards the field way below for a shock. Mario had a Bowser
racket! &quot;Hey, that's not right!&quot; he blurt out. He stood up
to get zero attention so he sat back down. &quot;Sometimes I don't
know why I sit up here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know why. Because I'm a loser,&quot; Boo said matter of
factly.</p>
<p>&quot;Me too. Thanks for the reminder.&quot;</p>
<p>The crowd around them cut the conversation short with roaring
laughter.</p>
<p>Luigi squinted his eyes. &quot;What happened?&quot;</p>
<p>Boo in turn covered theirs. &quot;I think the umpire hit Mario
with a ball!&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi didn't want to admit it but that served him right.</p>
<p>The sun beat down on everyone, thousands of eyes were watching,
including radio and news reporters, and the game was on. Mario swung
towards Toad who sprint to return the ball. Bowser intercepted at the
net and hit hard in Daisy's direction. The ball was almost past Daisy
when she did a back-flip into the its path and hit it backhand. It
then flew straight between the gap of Mario and Bowser and neither
could reach despite the effort.</p>
<p>&quot;Love-15.&quot; Lakitu announced.</p>
<p>Mario was left scratching his head at that one.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't know either, plumber boy. Let's just win.&quot;</p>
<p>Mario served again towards Toad who curved the ball around Bowser
at the net. Mario sliced the ball in front of Daisy. She delivered a
nasty topspin straight down the line. Bowser did a mad dash towards
center and returned it too hard so it shot out of bounds.</p>
<p>&quot;Out. Love-30!&quot;</p>
<p>Mario hit lightly towards Daisy. She shot back towards Mario who
returned it center. Toad sprung ahead and then the ball was flying
back to Mario before he could prepare. In one blink it was gone.</p>
<p>&quot;Game point!&quot;</p>
<p>Mario couldn't believe how the points were adding up. Every move
he made was now calculated against their unpredictable rivals. Thing
was, he'd need to be a super computer process it all when he was a
cheap Game&amp;Watch at most. They were collectively faster,
coordinated without looking, and hard hitting. He avoid aiming
towards either Toad or Daisy directly and let Bowser get aggressive
up front. After several volleys Bowser did an illegal power shot
sending the ball like a bullet bill past Daisy. She did a last ditch
back-flip and lobbed the ball in the air, far enough to make a tiny
shadow on the ground.</p>
<p>Bowser followed the shadow. &quot;I got it! I got it!&quot;</p>
<p>The shadow moved over Mario's head. &quot;I'll get it!&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser pushed Mario aside. &quot;You'll screw it up, stupid.
Move!&quot;</p>
<p>Mario shoved back. &quot;I was already here!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You heard me, grrrr!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Adsdfdsf sdf sdfsd!&quot;</p>
<p>They turned their heads to the other side of the net where Toad
was making those strange noises and Daisy was doing a handstand for
no reason. The ball bounced right between Mario and Bowser. Both
swung and the two iron rackets clung against each other
spectacularly. Mario was bounced back while Bowser's racket escaped
his claws and flung into the crowds.</p>
<p>&quot;Game, Daisy and Toad,&quot; Lakitu announced. He ducked as
cabbages and rotten cheese originating from the Koopa Troop
affiliates in the crowd soar over his head. Peach was uneventfully in
the other umpire chair. She disapproved of what was happening on
Lakitu's side but she was more concerned with the winning team. Daisy
was now spinning on her head like a break dance move, gaining more
and more uncontrollable speed. Toad stood in one place shaking
violently while still speaking those nonsensical words.</p>
<p>Peach hopped down from her seat. &quot;Oh my, call the medics!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just in time because I quit!&quot; Lakitu fled as medics
flooded the field. Some attended to Daisy after she finally collapsed
like a spin-top that's run out of steam while others attempted to
stabilize Toad. Reporters and civilians were also joining the crowd
even though they were certainly not authorized to.</p>
<p>&quot;We need space people!&quot; shout one magikoopa nurse
checking Daisy's pulse.</p>
<p>&quot;Could have used a pause after 'space',&quot; remarked his
Kong ER assistant. Just then however, they spotted whom they thought
was Tatanga the Space Alien in the crowds, so they began to pack up
and evacuate Toad and Daisy out of the tennis court before any baddie
got any ideas.</p>
<p>Bowser was like a bump on a log until seeing Toad and Daisy leave
on cots woke him up. He followed the last of the medical staff. &quot;How
dare those losers bail now! Hey! Yeah you!&quot;</p>
<p>Mario intercepted him. &quot;Because they <em>totally</em> chose
to have a medical emergency right now in a game they were easily
winning? Even you aren't that stupid.&quot;</p>
<p>Smoke threatened to pour from Bowser's nostrils. &quot;Shut up!&quot;
But otherwise he stood back from the commotion, waiting impatiently
with his arms crossed.</p>
<p>Luigi watched as Mario and Bowser lost the first set. Crowds stood
up and blocked the view of what was happening for a moment and poking
his head around them, Luigi saw medics on the field. He thought he'd
imagined it but it was all too real.</p>
<p>Boo jumped out of their seat. &quot;We'd better get out of here!&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi joined them. &quot;Uh huh! But how?&quot;</p>
<p>Boo grabbed his hand, startling Luigi. His vision went dark for a
second or two then he was right outside the mostly vacant courtyard
standing on the ground. They'd phased completely though the building
astonishingly.</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks, buddy!... Umm, we can let go now.&quot;</p>
<p>Boo let go slowly, flushing. &quot;Sorry, hehe. What do you think
happened?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Something fishy so lets make a special stop. I never get to
do anything with Mario around, but since he isn't..&quot; He fumbled
on his phone to message Mario as people began to spill out of the
stadium.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's?&quot; Boo squeak. &quot;You want to work with me?&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi put the phone away. &quot;Why not? I've always wanted a
sidekick. Remember when we were the 'Scare Pair' in Mario Party 6?
Instead of collecting stars let's collect.. bad guys!&quot;</p>
<p>Boo rushed forward and joined their hands to his to form the
official handshake of the bestest unlikeliest friendship.</p>
<p>Peach called security and left with Toad and Daisy, taking
advantage of these strange new air medical helicopters. Mario got
mixed up in the crowd before someone flagged him down, a familiar
face in the sea of many confused people still zipping around the
stadium.</p>
<p>&quot;Mario, I have enough for the bus. Come on,&quot; said his
dinosaur friend. Yoshi strolled along side him, studying his confused
expression. &quot;Oh right. Your brother texted you that he's taking
your bike for an emergency but I think he mass sent it by mistake.
I'm flattered that I'm in his 'favs' list I guess.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Emergency? Well thanks for having this all planed out so
soon. I hope he's alright.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He didn't make the text sound urgent. I'm more concerned
about you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh?&quot; Mario replied dismissively. &quot;I feel fine and
I'll buy you lunch if you get over it! Are we even now?&quot; Mario
smiled.</p>
<p>The seemingly endless but not actually bus ride dulled the mind of
one passenger in particular. Mario had two types of daydreams: those
involving food, the good ones, and ones involving his heroic duties
in a town and among people that counted on him the most. Those were
the even better ones. He could blast down battleships, topple tanks,
flatten fortress, even go toe to toe with a dragon koopa beast, but
he was still the linchpin. He could never forget that. What if he
found himself up against something bigger than him?</p>
<p>Who would his friends rely on then?</p>
<p>Then the packed Mushroom Bus swung around another curve.</p>
<p>&quot;You always were rough transport,&quot; Mario jest to Yoshi
on his right.</p>
<p>&quot;Was Bowser suspicious at any point today?&quot; Yoshi asked
more bluntly than Mario expected. &quot;When did he arrive with his
Mushroom Kingdom pass? Strange sights or smells?&quot;</p>
<p>Caught off guard he thought about it. &quot;Nothing out of the
ordinary except how he smelled which was.. good! The cologne was
probably '<em>Fleur de la m&egrave;re koopa</em>'. It's popular in
Dark Land when koopas are trying to attract- Er. No, I'm sure that's
not a clue.&quot; In the process of explaining that, being
scrutinized made him sweaty. Or maybe it was just the bus's air
condition being broken..</p>
<p>The bus arrived at Mushroom Kingdom Hospital, a flat roofed three
story building made of whitewashed stone on the Eastern side of Toad
Town. There was the center and then a left and right wing. A tall
mushroom flag was atop the roof which also was the spot for their
airlift services. Mario and Yoshi went inside where the waiting room
was already full of people. After saying 'excuse me' a lot, they
approached the reception office where the head nurse named 'Nass T.'
was stationed. While glued to her computer screen, her mouse darted
around the mouse pad frequently, clicking every five seconds.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello? Are Toad and Daisy in a room by now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Room 444,&quot; she droned, never bothering to look up.<br/>
...</p>
<p>In another side of town, Luigi and Boo continued to ride the Mach
bike. It had a compartment on the side for passengers that Luigi
typically occupied, but now he was the driver and he finally knew
what it was like to be in control, while adhering to the speed limit
of course. Still, he felt like a rebel, wild and free even if in a
very small way.</p>
<p>Boo pointed to an item shop. &quot;I know that place. Some bullies
beat me up over there this one time!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The 'Toddlers-R-Us'?&quot;</p>
<p>Boo was hesitant for a moment. &quot;...Yeah?&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi nodded instead of judging. &quot;Oh, me too! Toddlers can be
fierce, more so than adults!&quot;</p>
<p>They stopped at the Mushroom Press, a small building that provided
the town's newspapers and offices for many local reporters and
journalists. Luigi parked off the sidewalk and squeezed off the thick
helmet to find Boo shaking beside him.</p>
<p>&quot;C-can I wait outside?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It'll be alright,&quot; Luigi assured.</p>
<p>Boo faced the door for a moment, biting their tongue. &quot;Okay.
I'll do it..&quot;</p>
<p>The press had an open floor plan with office cubicles being the
only thing forming little rooms and hallways. On their left was the
nicer ones, with gold plaques, file cabinets, and an overall
professional aura. On the right had less reporters, ostensibly the
'fresh on the block' folks with a few folders to their name if that.
Boo heard the clacking of the keyboards, the scribbling of the pens,
and the shuffling of the papers then bolted back out the doors.</p>
<p>&quot;Are they okay?&quot; the desk clerk asked.</p>
<p>Luigi spun around. &quot;Uh, I'll have to check. Before I go, was
Kylie Koopa in? She's a friend of Mario-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right here!&quot; A female koopa with a pink shell and green
hat stumbled out of a nearby cubicle, sending paper everywhere.
Others around her eyed her exasperatedly. &quot;You gotta 'scoop' for
me?!&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi quickly explained what happened during the game because he
didn't trust his brother to not screw something up. He was about to
excuse himself when she reached out and grabbed him.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't bail yet, brother! I can't believe such a promising
game went south. Susie Que over there interviewed Mario before the
game. Let's see, are they back yet? Yoohoo!&quot; A green capped toad
in a suit, 'Mitch Toad' according to his fancy name plate, had a
cubical across from hers. He pulled his chair out into the hallway
and observed, his thick black eyebrows down turned.</p>
<p>&quot;Why don't you just relocate to the amateur side already,
babe?&quot; the toad asked in a mocking yet unexpectedly deep tone.</p>
<p>Kylie chucked a huge pink eraser at him which created a shouting
match. Caught in the middle Luigi blew a whistle. Everyone stopped
abruptly.</p>
<p>Outside, Boo paced around and around on the sidewalk slapping
themselves repeatedly in the forehead. &quot;Uggghhh. Boo, you're so
stupid! Can you be brave for once? Okay. 1..2..3..&quot;</p>
<p>Boo was startled by a dark boo with blonde stringy and obvious wig
floating up all of a sudden. Boo knew them vaguely, a boo cousin!</p>
<p>&quot;Laugh or else, buddy,&quot; the dark boo spoke gruffly but
jokingly.</p>
<p>&quot;This guy giving you trouble?&quot; Luigi said as soon as the
door swung open.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>The</em> Luigi? Neat. Wait. Oh crap!...&quot; the dark
boo brushed past the plumber to head inside. Luigi shut the door
quick suppressing a shiver.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry, Luigi! I freaked out,&quot; Boo explained,
emotions flooding forth. &quot;I just- I just heard-&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi grabbed his helmet again. &quot;Don't worry about it. I
don't know how some people function! Eek!&quot;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Mario knocked on room 444 before stepping in.</p>
<p>&quot;Visiting hours are-&quot; The doctor leaned up from stooping
over where Toad and Daisy lay in the wheeled beds. &quot;Ah hem. I am
Doctor Professor Koopa. Why don't you wait outside?&quot; he asked
very politely. His tone was wispy.</p>
<p>Yoshi stood in the doorway. &quot;Who again, if you don't mind?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You haven't heard of me? I've served your princess for many
years in the castle! Ask her!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You? A koopa doctor?&quot; Mario almost laughed at the
absurdity.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't be speciest,&quot; Yoshi said under his breath, gently
nudging Mario back.</p>
<p>Mario obliged and walked back out with Yoshi. &quot;I didn't mean
it like that. Why aren't they checking vitals? All I had was a bruise
yesterday after the race and I was hooked up to a million computers.&quot;</p>
<p>The dinosaur shrugged. &quot;Let's just let them do their job for
a moment.&quot;</p>
<p>With a smile Mario adjusted his cap. &quot;Perfect idea.&quot;</p>
<p>Yoshi eyed him skeptically. &quot;You actually agree?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, it's not like I'm Dr. Mario..&quot; From where
they stood Mario could see the crowded lobby full of Toad Town
citizens. What was Bowser doing right now? Before thinking about it
too hard, he saw Luigi walking inside.</p>
<p>Mario waved him over. &quot;What took so long? Why did you have to
take the bike?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I walked outside and saw that it had a flat tire and went to
fix it. Also this is Boo. They were at seated next to me during the
game.&quot; Luigi subtly tapped his friend, prompting them to speak.</p>
<p>&quot;Hi guys, hehe..&quot; Boo waved awkwardly.</p>
<p>&quot;So where are they?&quot; Luigi continued. &quot;Is it bad?&quot;</p>
<p>Mario lead the way retracing their steps but this time they got
stopped by a nurse long before reaching the right room.</p>
<p>&quot;No one past this point!&quot; The shy guy nurse in blue robe
held his stubby arms out.</p>
<p>Mario sized him up but remain cordial. &quot;That must be a
mistake. We were just back here.&quot;</p>
<p>The nurse shook his head smugly. &quot;Sorry. Princess's orders!
She's at the outside tables right now with a guest. Oops! I mean
she's in a secure location. Don't go there, or else!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Or- or else?&quot; Boo repeated, jittering all over.</p>
<p>While Boo sit it out, Mario, Luigi, and Yoshi rushed to the
emptied out eating area around the back of the hospital to get a
surprise. In the center Princess Peach was at a table having a quiet
chat with someone else very dear to Mario's heart, just in another
way he supposed.</p>
<p>&quot;Mario!&quot; Peach greeted, trying to not blush. &quot;We
were just discussing old times with someone we both happened to know.
The person was at my castle when I was a little girl and then he
moved out.&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi rushed to the middle of the table. &quot;That's nice and all
but Princess, but Bowser is within thirty feet of the you! Get him!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hold it, hold it,&quot; said Bowser seated across from
Peach, legs crossed. He had no pastry like her, instead a bi-folded
Dark Land newspaper, easily distinguishable by the yellow tinged
crusty look. &quot;I'm just sticking it out to see if those idiots
will be well enough for a rematch. She mentioned that professor guy
and I remembered that he was a mad scientist at my castle before I
fired 'em. We couldn't talk about it in the open. You mushroom freaks
would lose it. Does that make you feel better?&quot; Bowser bared his
fangs in that smile but not a smile expression. Luigi felt silly for
the overreaction but collectively they were all a bit flustered.</p>
<p>Peach scoot off the bench with a pout. &quot;The staff here are
always twisting my directions.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Please twist my direction! Ha!&quot;</p>
<p>Yoshi tossed an egg at Bowser on behalf of everyone. &quot;Are we
supposed to believe that you're going to wait around outside?&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser growled and the heat from his face made the egg fry right
away. &quot;OF COURSE I AM! What else am I gonna do?&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi began to recount a list. &quot;Terrorize everyone around
you, steal stuff, send your army here, try something with the
princess, eat all of the food...&quot; He dropped his hands. &quot;I'm
just saying, It's all been downhill since that power shot of yours
during the game.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gah! Why bring that up? <em>Power shots were cheap anyway</em>.
I wouldn't of needed it to win.&quot;</p>
<p>Peach shushed Bowser and strangely he listened. &quot;This is
getting off topic. We can check out this issue with the management,
but in the meantime we cannot exactly leave you out here alone,&quot;
she said, slowly gravitating Mario's way and into his arms. He held
her stiffly as his eyes narrowed and his moustache twitched.</p>
<p>&quot;Bowser. Why don't you stick with us then?&quot;</p>
<p>Eyebrows all around raised at that but the hero's mind was made
up. The closer to 'the enemy' the better.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Boo hid in the bathroom following that panic attack and stayed for
several minutes. &quot;Stupid stupid stupid..&quot; they started
again. Squeaks of shoes travel past the door and then stopped.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes sixty at this point. Why?..&quot;</p>
<p>Someone else mumbled something.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I just got the call and so we will do things different
today- Hold on we have a code blue on floor three. You answer my
calls only while I'm gone and if it is who I told you about just now,
put on hold and tell Nass.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes sir. I won't leave here. Even for lunch...&quot;</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>A minute later. &quot;Lunch break! Guess I'm leaving,&quot; the
same voice as the last said.</p>
<p>The bathroom door slowly crept open. No one was in the halls,
including the nurse. Boo wondered if they should sneak around and not
feel useless, but the thought of the consequences shattered that
fantasy. Then a phone vibrated on the medical cart. Boo stared at it
for five seconds before something deep inside pushed them to pick it
up.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is Giant Land Hospital, bro. I just called my bank and
the funds will totally be on your way tomorrow. You're gonna do what
we agreed now, right?&quot; Beeps and blips of a computer game was in
the background along with some clacking of a typewriter.</p>
<p>&quot;But that doesn't.. sound right,&quot; Boo thought out loud.</p>
<p>&quot;&hellip; Transfer me to your bosses please,&quot; the person
on the line hissed. &quot;If you try something funny, believe me pal,
I can find you and make your brain leak out of your skull into a
puddle on the ground!&quot;</p>
<p>With a loud shriek Boo dropped the phone and didn't remember much
else after.</p>

<p>Kylie Koopa circled in red ink a particular spot on her huge roll
out map of Toad Town where the tennis stadium was. It was about three
cubicles long and the entire hallway wide.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't mind me Steve,&quot; she mentioned, letting the tie
wearing bullet bill by. Steve the Bullet Bill ran the press and kept
it speedy with a respectable 150 wpm, but only on a specific
typewriter. He hid in his office before Kylie could remember to ask
him something. She decided to just visit the stadium and find clues
on her own. How would she get past security? She she had one idea..</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, wanna go back to the stadium with me? I'll let you snap
the pictures!&quot;</p>
<p>Susie gave a start, spinning away from the issued office computer
and phone. &quot;You want to what? I can't!&quot;</p>
<p>No matter, Kylie thought, she could always get her scoop even
working alone. However, something stopped her at the door, a mental
prick. She rolled her eyes hard, the only person that could do that
to her was not surprisingly also a 'prick'.</p>
<p>&quot;Whaddya want, Mitch?&quot; She forcibly swiveled Mitch's
chair around to face her.</p>
<p>&quot;I need to speak to you, babe. That new guy down there-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Susie? Pffft. It takes real levels of douche to talk trash
about someone who hasn't even worked here for a day. Worry about
yourself, greeney.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think you understand,&quot; he whispered. &quot;Be
careful at the stadium. That's.. all.&quot;</p>
<p>Kylie left. Meanwhile Mitch kept watch over Susie's space until
the lunch bell rang. Everyone working made their way out in one big
hungry group but when the dust settled, Susie was missing!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Many miles away most were blissfully unaware of Toad Town and more
concerned about making sure their sunscreen was up to par against the
intense rays of the tropical sun. Outside of Sirena Beach's Hotel
Delfino, tourists were spread everywhere outdoors under umbrellas or
on beach rugs to have a great time. No one paid attention to the dark
blue shelled noki passing them by on the trail to the hotel. The most
average tourist imaginable, he dark sunglasses and a red loose
fitting Hawaiian shirt. He greeted the desk clerk inside with a crisp
and pressed uniform.</p>
<p>The pianta quickly glanced over and stamp his documents. &quot;Cool,
no one ever has this crap filled out legibly. That's why I gots
these, brah!&quot; He pointed out the thick glasses on his nose.
&quot;Yours are neat too. Anyway, you're approved Mr. Jelectro. Take
this card key.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Merci.&quot; Jelectro went up the many stairs to his
standard single bed room all the way at the top. It had all of the
usual furnishings and a great view of the beach outside the window.
Only something was off&hellip; The noki corrected the slightly
crooked watercolor painting showing off Noki Bay. Very alluring, if
only he'd ever visited before. They didn't have that sort of thing
where he came from! He opened his suitcase up on the bed. He had
flowery shirts of all colors, a wet suit, a wallet with a badge, and
a silenced handgun.</p>
<p>He phone vibrated and he anwsered. &quot;Agent 0064, status?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am here safely. You?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not good,&quot; Agent N, the voice on the other line said.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay? What has happened so soon?&quot; Jelectro replied with
a more casual but alarmed change of tone.</p>
<p>&quot;I got a niece sick back in the Mushroom Kingdom along with a
string of others. HQ is still getting details. I don't mean to ruin
your vacation though. You did just assist with a counter-terrorist
operation a week ago so you deserve peace.&quot;</p>
<p>The line disconnected before enemy spies could trace the call. The
noki thought it over while watching the beach and those on it from
his vantage point with keen interest. He concluded that a week was
plenty of time to rest as long as five hundred steps to the top floor
weren't involved, that and he really wished the grounds keepers would
stop picturing some of the beach goers without clothes.</p>
<p>&quot;Brah with the sunglasses, leaving already?&quot; the desk
pianta asked the panting tourist returning with their luggage ready
to go.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Five people reentered the hospital from the back which lead to the
kitchen. At around lunch time now, the cooks were busily preparing
meals for staff, patients, and guests.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't believe I'm saying this, but don't mind Bowser,&quot;
Peach told the head chef, a toad with a brown twirly moustache and a
tall white hat. He nodded but by now others who saw Bowser stomp
inside started chain reaction of screaming, pots clanging, white
flour clouding the air, and eggs cracking to the floor.</p>
<p>The chef clap two pans together for a louder clang. &quot;Ze
princess has spoken! Come, come!&quot; He motioned the rest inside.</p>
<p>Mario, Luigi and Yoshi followed on the Koopa King's heels but
Peach blocked the way out, staring pensively through the little round
window and into the seating area that was steadily filling up. &quot;Bad
timing,&quot; she remarked. &quot;There is no way we're getting
Bowser through there without a mass hysteria.&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser gave out a haughty laugh. &quot;That's your dumb toad
subject's faults. Mine down home wouldn't bat an eye at something
scary, strange, suspicious-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gee that explains a lot,&quot; Yoshi cut in.</p>
<p>Mario stepped forward. &quot;I'll stay here and watch Bowser
then.&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi unfavorably glanced Bowser's and Mario's way. &quot;I need
to find Boo. Mario? I gotta admit, I was late meeting you here
because I hired a reporter to get more information.&quot; He hoped to
vex his brother a little and it worked, Mario's eyebrows not moving
but the corners of his mouth shifting downwards to reveal his
feelings.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll deal with that later,&quot; Mario replied stiffly.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll go with you to find Boo,&quot; Yoshi said, also to
dissipate the tension. Thankfully Bowser was situation blind as
always.</p>
<p>&quot;Ya'll suck at planning but I'll hang out here for now!&quot;
Bowser announced, his butt seated on a table meant for food
preparation and about to break it at that.</p>
<p>Peach went through the entire building on a linear path to visit
Nass up front, passing by and through many sterile and brightly lit
halls and feeling off. It was maybe even a little creepy. &quot;Where
is the Doctor Professor?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>Nass folded up freshly printed data sheets to add to many others
meticulously organized in trays. &quot;Wait at his office.&quot;</p>
<p>Peach power walked to his office. 'Dr. Prof. Koopa' was printed in
white bold letters on the door of the room <em>in which there was a
mystery</em>, but not the professor because the lights were out. &quot;How
wonderful..&quot; She groaned, resisting the urge to childishly huff
and puff.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't they know I gotta bad leg? I don't care about the
weight limit, I'm taking this,&quot; mumbled a whomp at the end of
the hall, suited in a wrinkled white doctor's coat and trudging to
the elevator.</p>
<p>Peach found herself going that direction, ignoring the voice in
the back of her mind to just be a docile princess for once. The
things you do for friends, she repeated, sprinting up steps to the
third floor where she thought the doctor might be heading and where
she knew were more offices. She got there and cautiously strolling
down the seemingly deserted area, one room labeled 'Board room #6'
stuck out because the lights were actually on. Then out from the door
spilled an elderly toad woman, the whomp from before, a blue shy guy,
a first responder, several junior assistants, and last Doctor
Professor Koopa, slipping something into his pocket. She froze in
place when everyone faced her equally surprised except for her old
childhood doctor who wore a weak smile. With zero subtlety everyone
but Doctor Professor distanced themselves or pretended to be busy
doing other things, even whistling when they clearly didn't know how.</p>
<p>&quot;Princess! What a fine young lady you are now. What do you
need?&quot;</p>
<p>Peach cocked an eyebrow subconsciously. &quot;I didn't mean to..
interrupt anything but honestly I have so many questions!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're worried about your friends I know. While the
specialty tests cannot be rushed, don't you worry. Everyone will be
fine 'Sweet Pea'.&quot; He gently put a hand on her shoulder.</p>
<p>Peach was almost mollified by that warm grandfatherly tone, but
there was still that slightest chill to his touch. &quot;Could we
please at least see Toad and Daisy?&quot;</p>
<p>Doctor Professor scanned a handheld pda. &quot;In fifteen minutes.
Is that alright? Good girl.&quot;</p>
<p>Peach walked away satisfied she'd gotten the upper hand. Maybe.
While sanctioned under her name she regrettably had little clue of
the inner workings of such a large place. Peach took the stairs again
while the elevator door open and a nurse rushed out arms flailing.
The toad girl resembling a shorter version of Nass T. tackled the
koopa doctor and both collapsed.</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry sorry,&quot; she pulled him up roughly. &quot;I'm
Emery T., roof top emergency services dudette. Did I miss the big
vote?&quot;</p>
<p>Doctor Professor slap away the girl's hands. &quot;Your ballot
wouldn't have counted anyway so get your butt to the cafeteria and
away from here!&quot;</p>
<p>A pipe above rattled, the main water line leading below. That was
because someone was flushing over and over to make noise and deter a
certain dinosaur from sticking around.</p>
<p>Back on ground level, Yoshi tapped on the stall door anyway. &quot;Boo,
I know you are in there. Luigi and I searched all over. He's getting
worried.&quot; Yoshi heard Boo sniffing a lot. He leaned up against
the door. &quot;What's wrong?&quot; he asked with a gentler tone.</p>
<p>&quot;...Y-you wouldn't understand.. They never do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Boo. How old are you?.. Twenty-five you say? I was even
younger than you when Yoshi's Island had its first disaster. Do you
know some old friends of mine didn't make it through that horrific
journey to stop Kamek?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know. But I'd be messed up if I internalized everything
I've ever been through. You don't need to do that to yourself
either.&quot;</p>
<p>The stall door unlocked and crept open with one beady eye looking
out. &quot;But I feel like everyday something bad happens to me. Or I
see things I can't deal with. I want to change it. I want to change
myself- but I can't!&quot;</p>
<p>Yoshi was about to speak when someone entered the restroom with a
joyous shout. &quot;Buddy! How'd I missed you here?&quot; Before Boo
could do much else, they were swallowed up by Luigi's hug. &quot;Are
you alright?&quot; he asked, still squeezing.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Boo answered in an obviously phony way. Yoshi
noticed and decided to not press it for now.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you want to deliver ze koopasta?&quot; the chef asked,
poking Bowser with a rolling pin. The Koopa King had now waited about
ten minutes in the kitchen forcing everyone to work around him. Now
it was time to put out the food into the eating area and serve.</p>
<p>&quot;DO I LOOK LIKE I WANT TO WORK HERE?&quot; Bowser bellowed.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, we might learn something out there. I'm sure there's a
hair net your size.&quot; Mario picked up the large salad bin.
&quot;Besides, workers of the kitchen get their meals free!&quot; he
mentioned as he left.</p>
<p>Bowser's eyes opened wide. &quot;Actually I mean- Get me a hair
net now!&quot; he growled to the chef.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>A teenage koopaling with a blue mohawk yank off his headphones,
springing up from the couch in the den of Bowser's Castle. &quot;Hey,
quit them downloads! You're making the internet connection too dang
slow!&quot; he yelled at the ocean princess koopaling on the floor
stomach down playing the Playstation 4 a few feet away from the wide
screen tv.</p>
<p>&quot;Hold on Larry, gosh!&quot; Wendy replied. &quot;I'm trying
to get my account set up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can't you use Iggy's like you always do?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now way. I have to download my personal games right now on
my own account- Plus, I have privileges to use the tv and you don't!&quot;</p>
<p>Larry groaned and moaned, and made whatever prepubescent and
unimpressive growling noises he could to show his disdain. &quot;Sooooo
lame!&quot; Wendy's phone and videogame privileges were rarely
revoked unlike with her brethren so Larry was stuck with Kamek's
dusty laptop where the plastic would start to melt if he played
solitaire too long and the hinges were loose so it was constantly
snapping down on his fingers.</p>
<p>His phone made a noise, then Wendy's. &quot;Attention! All
koopalings meet in 'the room', now!&quot; the text said, sent to all
of the koopalings at once.</p>
<p>&quot;Nope!&quot; Larry shut it off.</p>
<p>&quot;Now you sound smart, sugar!&quot; Wendy's bejeweled phone
sat aside, she proceeded to download 'Princess Parlor 7'.</p>
<p>&quot;Wonderful for <em>some</em> of us to be here,&quot; Ludwig
said as he sat on top an upside down mop bucket. The single light
bulb above among cobwebs flickered as it always did. 'The room' was a
broom closet the Koopalings used for secret meetings. The secret room
used to be in a better more convenient place that didn't have a bad
smell, like the kitchen, but that wasn't very secret of course.
Cramped up with him in tight space were Roy, Lemmy, and Morton.</p>
<p>&quot;I got koopaball practice today. Make it quick.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am not to be rushed!&quot;</p>
<p>Roy shot up and gave his eldest brother a noogie, completely
ruining his styled hair.</p>
<p>&quot;Stop it stop it!&quot; Ludwig pushed him away.</p>
<p>&quot;But I need the time. I'm starting a book club, you know?
I've been talking online and these people are really going to fund my
Kickstarter for the eight hundredth edition of the 'Bestest, Most
Superior, Most Exquisite Thesaurus Ever' with me as the writer,
author, and wordsmith!&quot; Morton explained in one breath.</p>
<p>&quot;What are we even doing again?&quot; Lemmy asked, twirling a
broom handle between his fingers.</p>
<p>&quot;We are here because of the plan!&quot;</p>
<p>Morton snapped his fingers like he caught on. &quot;...I&hellip;I&hellip;
Oh no, I lost it. Can I have a hint?&quot;</p>
<p>Ludwig sighed heavily. &quot;Take a guess. Wait, do not. You might
spread some of your stupid. Vater does not know at this moment what
our plans are because that is how surprises work,&quot; he explained
like teaching a kindergarten class.</p>
<p>Lemmy raised one hand while in the other was a cellphone with
different colored buttons and a pink plastic shell. &quot;So this
means I can't text King Dad to tell him I broke another speed
gymnastics record?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lemmy, your phone is merely an effigy. You just turned
twenty-two last month. I thought Vater was going to get you a real
cellular phone?&quot;</p>
<p>Lemmy revealed a real one that had a huge touch screen and was
super expensive. The plastic wrap was still on it. &quot;He did give
me this one but it's boring. So can I text Dad or not? I'm still not
getting the rules.&quot;</p>
<p>Ludwig felt his face get hot but he wasn't going to hurt anyone.
Yet. &quot;Call Vater then but be discreet!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay!&quot; Lemmy happily pressed the speed dial for Bowser
but only after he peeled that protective plastic off, savoring the
moment. Maybe that was how they got people to buy new phones every
year. It was just that satisfying to peel that new plastic!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Mario scooped up and served salad to various people in the open
while Bowser was cooped up in a window out of direct view serving
scoops of green peas to everyone who passed him with a tray. The
Koopa King kept an eye on that pesky plumber a short distance away.
His goofy movements were amusing to see along with that dumb smile he
flashed at every visitor. Bowser had to admit it was slightly
infectious but why he didn't know..</p>
<p>Bowser gave the next person, a toad girl, two giant helpings of
peas. &quot;I'm feeling generous. Get your vitamins in. Ha!&quot;</p>
<p>Emery T. glanced up from her tray. &quot;But hate peas uh, Bowser&hellip;
BOWSER?!&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser quickly scoot back farther in that window to hide his face.
&quot;Uh oh.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No no no.&quot; Emery leaned in, even though it was holding
up the line. &quot;I'm like your biggest fan!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You? A fan?&quot;</p>
<p>Emery raised her hidden gold Bowser brooch necklace that was
tucked into her shirt. &quot;See? Only you can save this hospital.&quot;</p>
<p>Someone tapped her shoulder. &quot;Excuse me ma'am-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Go around me then!&quot; she barked at the nurse behind her.
&quot;-But anyway something strange is going on. A bunch of people,
including Toad and Daisy haven't gotten treatment since they got
here! We've never done that plus I missed an important meeting so I
don't know who to complain to! I know you're the best Bowser, can you
help?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Slow down,&quot; Bowser said as he got a call on his busted
up flip phone. He saw it was from home so he shoved the oversized
serving spoon to the server besides him.</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot sssserve your peassss and my fried mushroomsss at
the sssame time,&quot; the fire snake complained. &quot;I have no
handsssssss!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shut up. Hey, this is Bowser&hellip; Lemmy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hi King Dad,&quot; Lemmy greeted, bouncing down the castle's
hallway with Ludwig following and trying to listen in.</p>
<p>&quot;Keep it down!&quot; Ludwig repeated. &quot;And do not
reveal-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm just calling because you didn't finish your tennis game
and we were gonna inva- ack! Mmm mm mm!...&quot;</p>
<p>Ludwig kept his arm around Lemmy's face. &quot;Give me the phone.
Hello, Vater?... Enjoying the city? I heard about the game
canceling... Tough, correct?... Take your time. Kammy went shopping
to purchase you some items you enjoy like-&quot; He held the phone
away to whisper in Lemmy's ear. &quot;What does Vater like, aside
from princesses?&quot;</p>
<p>Lemmy, still being strangled shrugged at first but then remembered
something. He motioned with two fingers someone running then jumping
high over another object represented by this fist. Ludwig stared at
that blankly, clearly not getting the picture.</p>
<p>&quot;-Anyway whatever she will procure you'll enjoy once you get
here at a time later than now,&quot; Ludwig continued.</p>
<p>Bowser stayed silent before exploding, &quot;You talk too much! I
ain't leaving anyway until either someone kicks me out or I find out
what's wrong with my tennis rivals!&quot; Bowser had by now walked
outside around back with the tables again for privacy. &quot;Now
don't bother me again!&quot;</p>
<p>Ludwig dropped his brother and tapped his foot. &quot;You are
prohibited from external communication until further notice.
Understood?&quot;</p>
<p>Lemmy bounced right back up without a scratch. &quot;Yeah
whatever. And why did you miss my clue? That other thing King Dad
likes?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And what would that be?&quot;</p>
<p>Lemmy spun his ball on one finger and rolled his eyes like it was
a dumb question. &quot;It's Mario, duh. The only other thing he's
always thinking about...&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser returned to his spot. He couldn't find weird toad fangirl
and the crowd thinned out. Mildly irritated he ripped off the hair
net and found a little note near his station with a number scribbled
on it.</p>
<p>&quot;Zat ist it for now!&quot; the chef declared, hanging up his
hat. &quot;Good job.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, especially since we didn't have many patient meals to
prepare,&quot; said a hammer bro washing dishes.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's meet around the side this time,&quot; Mario said to
Bowser, surprising him. &quot;Peach texted with some news.&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser tried to play it cool and obeyed. They walked outside and
around to the side of the hospital where the Starman lane ran past it
and everything was normal enough. Peach stood inconspicuously under a
tree with her parasol up and as the hero and villain joined her
Yoshi, Luigi, and Boo strolled up as well.</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks for meeting me here, everyone. I spoke to the doctor
and he had a perfectly reasonable explanation,&quot; Peach explained
with an edge in her tone that hinted she really believed other wise.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd love to hear it Peach,&quot; Mario said.</p>
<p>&quot;They are running 'special' tests. We can walk in and visit
right now&hellip; though,&quot; she paused with one hand on her chin.
&quot;Bowser is still an issue.&quot;</p>
<p>To their surprise Bowser didn't fuss. &quot;Then I'll just stay
outside 'Hotness'. Moustache, text me when you're in the room and
I'll meet there and listen from the window outside. I'm good at
stalking people from windows ya see.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah hem. I do hope you practice that skill only at home,&quot;
Peach said wryly. &quot;Anyway we should get going. I don't like
anything about this place.&quot;</p>
<p>Like a squadron Mario sent the five including Boo back through the
front lobby and down that hall all over again. The blue shy guy
sipping on a canned soft drink said nothing as they walked pass. Boo
took one lingering glance backwards but kept on moving as they rushed
forward to that room 444. Finally they made it and Mario stopped
before the door.</p>
<p>&quot;Alright. Finally some answers, right? Let's-a go!&quot;</p>

<p>Kylie Koopa got off the bus near the tennis stadium. There were
yellow banners blocking the entrances but no police around, at least
not anymore. She walked around cautiously, camera and grappling hook
in hand. Maybe she'd try around back and away from the busy street
just in case. The local police station was probably getting sick of
her.</p>
<p><em>Whoooooosh</em>&hellip;</p>
<p>Her spine was hit with the sensation of a frigid winter breeze
growing in intensity. By the time she reached the coliseum like outer
walls, her fingers were too stiff to untie her ropes. Giving up she
dropped them to the ground and hugged her arms up, making a decision
to take the direct route after all. The tunnel in was dark but she
saw the light on the other side. She ran forward to something in the
middle of the tennis court. Trash and other items were discarded all
around, including an orange flowery hair band.</p>
<p>Kylie picked it up and studied it before seeing a shadow move in
the corner of her eye. She whipped back around her found nothing. She
then checked the locker rooms. The first was dark inside was faintly
musty but also empty aside from something charred up in the center.
She reasoned that was the one Bowser used given the Koopa King's
known tendencies so she checked the other locker room to find it
locked. Light was creeping out from its bottom but that was as far as
she could theorize. With other clues picked over she was going call
it there, especially since she was now sweating, burning up with a
heat inside and out and she wondered what was with the temperature
changes. She thought she heard a bell chime and familiar voices some
distance away and distorted while she hurriedly stumbled upon
discarded Fungus Up soda cans. Feeling to muggy to think, she snapped
a picture and retreated back to the exit before she passed out. The
last thing she wanted was to do that in the middle of somewhere she
shouldn't be.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Bowser had his back against the wall of the hospital under some
shade. He kept his voice very low unnaturally while he dialed the
number left on a note. &quot;This is Bowser. Fangirl chick, right? I
found your little love letter.&quot;</p>
<p>Stationed on the hospital's roof, Emery covered her mouth as she
squealed. &quot;It's really you again!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Listen, you might can help me but.. hmm I just can't see a
toad as so loyal..&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?! I totally am!&quot; She glanced over her shoulder for
security cameras. &quot;I've, like, been a fan since forever. Before
my mom took permanent night shifts she would tell me scary stories
about you but I was never scared. I even made my own stories. I'm
totally a social outcast because of it&hellip; Oh and because I don't
mind seeing blood and guts and stuff.. but I'm sure it's mostly the
Bowser thing why people don't like me. So what do you need me to- uh
hello?&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser continued laughing hard. &quot;Just help me get to the
bottom of what's going on quicker. You had something about ya, I
could tell you were different than most dumb toads. I think you could
help after all. Ha!&quot;</p>
<p>Emery checked her back again. &quot;I totally can! I think I still
have the number of an old classmate who's with a team that does some
things- Uh oh gotta go!&quot; She hid her things away and got into
proper position as she spotted a helicopter approaching for landing.</p>
<p>Bowser hung up on his end, eyes still watery from his guffaws when
he found a text from 'Plumber Breath' waiting for him&hellip; He
wondered what Mario had him labeled as in his contacts. Oh whatever.
Via the text he learned where room 444 was and found it, putting his
ear against the window with blinds blocking a view in. There was
talking inside..</p>
<p>&quot;This is it? And what are you doing in here?&quot; This was
Mario, he knows.</p>
<p>&quot;Just checking records,&quot; replies someone unfamiliar with
a low gravely voice, likely literally. Likely a whomp or other rock
baddie species.</p>
<p>&quot;Well it's good you're here isn't it? What's wrong, nurse?&quot;
Luigi's unmistakable voice asks.</p>
<p>&quot;Prognosis unknown. I will be leaving.&quot; The doctor
shuffles away with heavy footsteps.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh man! Bro, get a look at this. They are green! Aww...&quot;
The bed squeaks as if someone is leaning on the edge. Luigi probably.</p>
<p>&quot;Is t-that bad?&quot; a new soft spoken person asks. It
seemed to Bowser like that boo diddly 'loser' tag-along.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd say so since they certainly weren't during the game. I-
I mean I would know from the umpire position!&quot; That is Peach for
sure nearest to the window. If only he had a visual from the rear,
Bowser thought with a dark chuckle. He tapped lightly on the window
to capture their attention, not really sure why he'd hesitated that
long. Bowser didn't know what he thought he'd glean from
eavesdropping the Mario brats. Even if he heard something bad said
against him it's not like he'd care, he reassured himself.</p>
<p>Shortly the window and the blinds slid up just few inches for him,
courtesy of Mario. Bowser could now see Toad and Daisy on beds with
an iv system hooked to them along with beeping computers. Their skin
had a pale green hue. Luigi was clutching on the ends of Daisy's bed
with Boo right behind him. Yoshi was silently watching something on
their monitors and Peach's reaction was hidden by facing the other
way.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm doing something about this right now. 'Prognosis
unknown' my royal pedicured feet! They've had ample time to do
something!&quot; she said, facing Mario. The plumber seemed wound up
to reply when Bowser cut him off.</p>
<p>&quot;I like that new attitude 'Hotness'!&quot; Bowser was still
eyeing Peach's backside when suddenly the window shut and nearly took
off his claws with it.</p>
<p>Inside the room, Mario sheepishly spun back around after ridding
everyone of that nuisance. &quot;Sorry. Are all for shutting this
place down? Uh, perfect!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;W-wait...I heard something on the phone.&quot;</p>
<p>Everyone turned to Boo. &quot;You mean on the internet?&quot;
Luigi asked.</p>
<p>After gulping Boo shook their head. &quot;Not a smart phone, the
hospital's phone. While I was hiding some doctors were talking. They
said about sixty are sick right now in this building and then one of
their phones on the wall just rung and no one was around and and- Oh
don't let anyone know I answered! Some other hospital is paying this
one to do something really weird and usual!&quot; Shivering, Boo
backed themselves in a corner.</p>
<p>&quot;As if we didn't have enough reasons to take control,&quot;
Peach held the handle to the door. &quot;As the princess this place
will listen to me from now on-&quot; She swung it open.</p>
<p>&quot;Visiting time over!&quot; Announced the blue shy cheekily,
Azul as his name badge stated, standing in the door way.</p>
<p>Peach and everyone else brushed past the nurse, ignoring him
completely.</p>
<p>Azul panicked and followed, trying to keep up and wave them down.
&quot;Guys! I mean it! Doctor Professor Koopa is the new leader as of
thirty minutes ago! Princess, you don't control anything any more!&quot;</p>
<p>Peach froze and everyone ran into her from behind. &quot;What did
you say?!&quot;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>In Dark Land Tuesdays were unfavorable and inconvenient for even
the locals as storms wiped out visibility even in the nicer areas
like Neo Bowser City. Bowser Castle wasn't there however, it was just
in World 8 and it wasn't Tuesday but instead a certain magikoopa's
shopping day, a day that could be any day of the week she managed to
sneak the keys away from Kamek. An enormous dust cloud shot into the
sky after an aircraft crash landed behind the castle with a rumble
felt for miles. Most of the koopalings were in the castle's spacious
den when it happened goofing off. Larry yanked off his headphones
again and his light blue eyes scanned the room for the most likely
culprit.</p>
<p>&quot;Sis! That's too much bass from the stereo. I felt like the
whole freaking ground was like, shaking, which would usually be cool
but not with your trashy-&quot;</p>
<p>Wendy flung an extra controller at him without taking her
attention off the dating sim she played on the television. &quot;Not
me! It was probably Morton's horrible ring tone from DJ Drybone5 or
somebody.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I believe you are false, wrong, inaccurate as I changed it
to this!&quot; Morton played the new tune that had an even more
grating beat.</p>
<p>Lemmy sat in the corner building an impressive doll sized house of
multicolored building blocks. He stopped and sniffed the air. &quot;Anyone
smell smoke?&quot;</p>
<p>Iggy's head snap up from the green transparent gameboy it was
buried in. &quot;My radioactive microwave downstairs!... Wait no that
blew up last week... Oh that reminds me, there's still a ton of extra
sodas stacked up in the basement so I got bored and you should see
the stack formations I've made with them like a convex icosahedron!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shut up before I punch you,&quot; Roy mumbled from the
couch, leaning all the way back lazily with his arms folded.</p>
<p>&quot;Attention! Mandatory meeting in the back yard!&quot; Ludwig
group texted everyone, resulting in a half dozen phones going off at
once. There was some of everything, techno songs, rap songs, trap
songs, and a simple bell because one of them were basic..</p>
<p>Larry silenced his first. &quot;Crap, I think we all gotta do what
it says or Luddy will get us triple grounded.&quot; The other
Koopalings dismissed Larry and went back to what they were doing
except his sister.</p>
<p>Wendy paused the game and rolled her eyes. &quot;Luddy IS a tattle
tell. Listen to little runt just this once.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks sis!&hellip; Hey!&quot; Larry retorted as everyone
dragged their feet out the room and left him behind. &quot;And wait
for meeeeee!&quot;</p>
<p>Koopa Airships were nearly indestructible but the Earth not so
much. In the barren backyard typically used for mass enemy formation
training, the family's one really good airship was half way sunk into
the ground creating a crater. Tall red dirt mounds were littered
everywhere and cracks were forming in the dry desert like soil.
Despite all of that, Kammy Koopa walked away from it like nothing had
happened, arms full of shopping bags.</p>
<p>&quot;Dearies, I got something for yoooooou!&quot; Kammy sang,
heading towards the koopalings.</p>
<p>Everyone couldn't help but to cheer. Their father and Kamek rarely
got them gifts but Kammy on the other hand? Of course they were
frequently odd gifts but something nonetheless. Meanwhile a
particularly Ludwig sized dirt mound started to jiggle. It had been
there all along unoticed. Some bloodshot eyes appeared from it, next
a red hot face emerged, then the rest of the body, fists balled and
shaking.</p>
<p>&quot;What in Eldstar's name is wrong with you crazy woman?!&quot;
Ludwig screamed, making everyone silent.</p>
<p>Kammy's little head poke around the stacks of shopping bags. &quot;You
know how I have lil problem reaching the break pedal, ee hee hee!
Take this and chill out, boy!&quot; She tossed a yellow Banana Bird
Republic bag full of hair spray his way.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm totes jealous,&quot; Wendy muttered, giving Ludwig the
stink eye.</p>
<p>&quot;But you're bald... Ouch you little-&quot; Larry was jabbed
by his sister.</p>
<p>&quot;Focus! Everyone focus!&quot; Ludwig snap his fingers.
&quot;Time?&quot;</p>
<p>Lemmy checked his artsy 'wrist watch'. &quot;There's been exactly
zero minutes and no seconds since we've been standing here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lemmy, your watch is drawn on your wrist with crayon. Hey, I
should invent a watch that can freeze time like yours!&quot; Iggy
said, rubbing his hands together as he got unfortunate ideas.</p>
<p>Ludwig put snobbishness aside and resorted to checking his phone
for the time then craned his neck back, facing the sky as he
bellowed, &quot;Curses! We are massively delayed. Blast it!&quot; He
dashed inside the airship so fast Kammy spun in place and flung the
rest of the bags. Makeup, a new broom, granny clothes, old people
knickknacks, as seen on tv products, and flat walking shoes flew
everywhere. Ludwig ran right back out, using the black blazer he wore
to cover his mouth from dust. &quot;Good *cough* news.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can go back to bed, snooze, slumber?&quot; Morton asked.</p>
<p>Ludwig called someone shockingly to the family since the commander
had no friends, girlfriend, or social life. &quot;Hello,
underling?... It's Prince Ludwig to you, not 'bro'!...I accept that
apology now listen, Bowser is in the city so keep it that way while
we handle this set back... Yes you can. I know of your escapades in
this castle...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Underling?&quot; Iggy mused, the first to dare speak up. &quot;Oh
that guy! What about our other dudes, Sam and Slam with the delivery
trucks this morning? I bet they quit early arguing over something
like always, hehe!&quot;</p>
<p>Ludwig hung up. &quot;What about them? For now we need to excavate
our means of transport!&quot;</p>
<p>Wendy scoffed with her nose aimed high. &quot;Don't we have like,
soldiers for this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But work is fun,&quot; Lemmy said.</p>
<p>&quot;No one listen to Lemmy!&quot; Iggy waved his arms around. &quot;I
can't mess up my video-game playing hands!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;ENOUGH! Here's a wise lesson I was taught: Physical training
builds character.&quot; Ludwig dropped a pile of shovels at their
feet with a smirk. &quot;No one reenters the castle until then!&quot;</p>
<p>Everyone scrambled to dig up their airship, including Larry who
grumbled the entire time. Why did he have to be forced to take part
in another one of <em>Ludwig's schemes</em>? He didn't even want to
be a villain when he got out of high school...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Mitch's Lexus, a black sedan he'd owned for five years now and
spotless, came to a stop at Starman Lane's many red lights. He had in
his lap a rolled up magazine from the movie star K. Kool Koopa he was
to interview later and many other appointments so he needed to hurry
back and look presentable. The glove compartment was unsuccessfully
ravaged for more facial tissues and aspirin for his searing headache.
He hoped he could make it to the press before he stained his suit
with the nose bleed he got from successfully deterring that creep at
the stadium away from Kylie Koopa. The light changed green so he
mashed that pedal. Traffic was thin expect for a bus on the opposite
side farther down.</p>
<p><em>Ding ding ding.</em></p>
<p>That noise. It was that creep again! His attention darted back to
the road in time to see a speeding mushroom bus veering into his lane
head on and there was nowhere to go. Before he had time to dread
even, the vehicles collided and his car crumpled, the frame warping
and compressing, and tiny shards of glass from the windshield
spraying him. The driver of the public transportation vehicle never
let go of the gas, instead limp and deceased before the crash ever
happened. The ghost bus kept rolling down the street while the Lexus
was slung into an empty grass field off the road. Only then did the
airbag deploy with a weak sounding poof. Mitch was conscious just
enough to realize that he could neither move nor scream...</p>
<p>The first person to notice the horrific accident was koopa on an
afternoon jog. Around this block he always exercised and the usual
excitement never toppled bad street performers dizzy dancing. Jogging
in place he started to call emergency services when he was whacked
with a tennis racket, a green Bowser racket a number of people might
have caught a glimpse of at a certain tennis game. Knocked out the
fitness junkie fell at the feet of a dark looming figure with no feet
at all. Surveying the accident scene the attacker's eyes squint
slightly due to astigmatism while their lips curled upwards in
satisfaction.</p>
<p>&quot;That'll teach you to follow me around, bro,&quot; the person
softly said into Mitch's driver window. Then they vanished like the
boo they were&hellip;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Mario slammed his hands down at Nass's desk making the entire
hospital lobby get silent. A dozen eyes were now on him and crew and
hoping to use that to his favor he became loud and dramatic. &quot;We
know others are sick like our friends! We know you've changed
leaderships! You're going to tell us what's going on!&quot;</p>
<p>Nass stared blankly before shooting up form her chair. &quot;Don't
complain to me!&quot; she belted. &quot;Talk to Doctor Professor for
crying out loud!&quot; She pressed a button over and over but no one
was responding.</p>
<p>&quot;Are these guests giving you problems?&quot; asked the whomp
doctor in passing to Nass T.</p>
<p>&quot;You ain't seen problems yet!&quot; Bowser pushed open the
doors and stomped inside to make many gasp.</p>
<p>&quot;This is getting out of control..&quot; Peach held her
temple. If only she could just vanish away from this madness. Boo
could actually do that, but they were petrified beyond movement.</p>
<p>&quot;Why are you up here Terrace? But since you are, please
escort these people out!&quot; Nass ordered.</p>
<p>Dr. Terrace shrugged. &quot;Right now? With my knees? Ha! Oh, and
the health inspectors are right about..&quot;</p>
<p>Someone else burst through the doors, strong enough to knock
Bowser out of the way. &quot;Dis is Jimmy M. of the Mushroom Kingdom
Disease Control Unit!&quot; announced the short monty mole grandly.
He wore a bright yellow hazmat like plastic suit and he scurried to
the front desk very quickly to dig into their business.</p>
<p>&quot;Who sent you here?!&quot; the head nurse gasp as James dug
into all of her files and flung them high in the air.</p>
<p>The mole whistled loudly, finding what he wanted. &quot;Dis is it,
boys!&quot;</p>
<p>This prompted three others to rush in against the traffic of the
lobby guests they'd scared away, a mega goomba, a koopa paratroopa,
and a wiggler. They split up and went down all of the halls banging
on doors and disturbing the peace. Every nurse and patient that could
scrambled out the doors during the emergency. Mario got separated
from Peach first then he lost Luigi then Yoshi when the wave of the
evacuating people finally swallowed him and the world went from black
to blue because he was staring at the partially cloudy sky in the
parking lot outside the hospital where the crowd left him. Mario
leaned up. Everyone else was displaced in the yard and a huge truck
with 'MKDCU' was parked in front of the entrance. On autopilot he ran
that way just in time to catch those health inspectors again, already
wheeling patients out. There was a yoshi, a koopa, then a toad- Toad
Toad and a girl- Daisy!</p>
<p>&quot;Wait!&quot; Mario shouted but the snifit driving the truck
slam on the gas. The car sped off into the distance with his friends.
He watched it down the road in disbelief.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, plumber&hellip; We gotta find our tennis rivals!&quot;It
almost seemed like Bowser seemed to almost say more but Mario had no
time to read into that.</p>
<p>&quot;You think?!&quot; Mario faced his rival. Bowser just
shrugged.</p>
<p>Six people regrouped at Club 64, a landmark diner most Toad Town
residence knew well for his homely atmosphere. It especially made it
stand out to sleeker and larger but less cozy competitors, like Club
Gamecube across the street. Mario ordered a piece of toast for
everyone at the round table in the front. The mood was predictably
sour, zapping most appetite anyway. The spinning ceiling fans purred
on the hot day and that was mostly the only sound heard, Bowser being
there scaring everyone else out. Yoshi's attention remained on the
bulky old television screens usually set to closed caption only, but
there was no report of the hospital incident in the mix of mundane
miscellaneous news and toad fashions...</p>
<p>&quot;Yoshi, what do you think?&quot; Mario asked him.</p>
<p>Yoshi slid away his juice. &quot;Too early to say.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It ain't that complicated. I know exactly who did it,&quot;
Bowser explained all important like.</p>
<p>&quot;You <em>do</em>?&quot; Peach said skeptically.</p>
<p>&quot;Themselves, or Toad and Daisy I mean. Yep. Afraid to face me
in my prime they force a reschedule. Do ya read flower chick's
profile? It's all over Daisy's Facebook wall that she didn't want to
play today.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So they stage their own fall out? That's ridiculous. Bowser,
if you're not going to help leave!&quot; Luigi pointed out the door,
glaring at Bowser who wore a little smirk but didn't move in his
silent dare. Luigi's eyes then wandered to Mario subconsciously for
support. Mario seemed to shrink a little under that gaze, almost
unheard of the younger brother thought. Then again Mario was always
awkward for no reason when Bowser was in company but they weren't
fighting. What was typical of Mario however was the ability to mask
over that vulnerability in an instant.</p>
<p>&quot;Bowser. We don't need you anymore. Get out,&quot; Mario told
Bowser plainly.</p>
<p>Some annoyance or anger, no one was sure, flashed over Bowser
before he stood up abruptly. &quot;Smell ya later then, losers.&quot;
He stomped out, letting the chair fall over.</p>
<p>Peach wrinkled her nose while Bowser was leaving. &quot;Thank the
stars..&quot; She stood up and straightened out her clothes. &quot;I
am not abandoning this situation or anything but I should return to
the castle briefly, assuming I have not been 'voted out' there also,&quot;
she said with hints of bitterness at the end.</p>
<p>Mario's arm reached for hers. &quot;I'll escort you. The rest of
you head back to the hospital for clues.&quot; He escaped with her
before Luigi could question anything else.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Kylie Koopa arrived back at the Mushroom Press well past lunch and
returned to her desk, dropping her notebook flat with a plop.
Immediately something hit her, she spun around to realize that Mitch
was missing from his cubical. He rarely left even for his lunch, even
more alarming she found when his lunch box was still under his table
with sandwiches in it.</p>
<p>Kylie came up to the front desk. &quot;Jessie, have ya heard from
that ol' Mitch since lunch? Just curious.&quot;</p>
<p>The desk lady shook her head so Kylie returned to her space. She
had to work with Luigi's eyewitness account and the two cans Toad and
Daisy might have drank before the game. She knew from past work that
Fungus Up was hardly sold anymore but a quick search on the Toad Town
message boards had a post marked around seven that morning saying
that a stand of Fungus Up cans appeared in the park as a sort of
promotion. It was up for grabs. What did her old reports say on that
company? Some of Kylie's files were purged a few years ago in the
process of relocating but maybe Mitch still had them. -If he was
still around&hellip;</p>
<p>Feeling she was in a bind, she scraped up what she could. One
message purportedly stated that a truck dropped them off and had much
more in the back but the two drivers began discussing some sort of
tabletop game. Next they were speedily driving off leaving only one
bunch. Another said that someone added the promotional material
later. Neither had images to back anything up, assuming it even
transpired as they claimed. Kylie would contact Luigi for an update
even if she had nothing definitive to prove. Her office phone rung
for a moment while someone entered the press for a paper.</p>
<p>&quot;Right here, sir,&quot; Kylie heard Jesse say a distance
away. She idly watched the noki in a Hawaiian shirt and black
sunglasses scan the newspaper nearly as tall as him and nod his head.</p>
<p>&quot;Didn't see your stories?&quot;</p>
<p>The noki rolled it up under his arm and handed over the coins.
&quot;No, merci.&quot; Kylie eyed him out the door as he approached
an Aston Mushroom car, a super expensive 'thang' as she'd put it, at
a parking meter. Had to be a tourist, she thought.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you sure you want to do this without Mario?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; says the plumber hopping over the fence
with ease, entering a protected 'employees only' area. Their third
companion after a brief hesitation phases through the barrier like
thin air. Last the dinosaur rolls his eyes and hops over as well with
a well timed flutter jump.</p>
<p>&quot;We could have at least chosen a less blatant way,&quot;
Yoshi admits, crouched near the partially obscured back doors with
the other two like burglars.</p>
<p>Luigi stands up then. &quot;That's too bad because we have to do
something and not just because Mario suggested we do.&quot;</p>
<p>Yoshi sees the hurt flash on his features and takes a different
route. &quot;Just message him that we couldn't find a safe way.&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi shakes his head quickly. &quot;I'm afraid to text anything
after this morning. Next I might end up sending all of my friends my
private pictures of tropical beaches!&quot;</p>
<p>Yoshi stares at him funny, wondering it that's a euphemism. &quot;Never
mind. I have an idea. A safe one.&quot;</p>
<p>Boo silently thanks Eldstar for that.</p>
<p>Yoshi turns to Boo. &quot;But we'll need you.&quot;</p>
<p>Boo retracts that.</p>
<p>Nass is back at her desk tending to her data sheets. Mushroom
Kingdom hospital's front lobby is as straightened up as they can
manage but the automatic door is a casualty, broken and permanently
stuck wide open. Leaves and dust from outside piles up to the staff's
annoyance so Doctor Professor Koopa has just called in an intern from
their sister hospital in Southern Mushroom Kingdom to help with clean
up.</p>
<p>&quot;Howdy. It's me,&quot; greets the mature koopa paratroopa in
blue janitor outfit holding a mop bucket. A grey pony tail reaches
his back.</p>
<p>&quot;Probabilly Koopa?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yup.&quot; Unceremoniously he begins tidying up the dust
without further instructions. Nass wonders if she should say anything
but decides not to as a little boo comes in.</p>
<p>&quot;Nurse I'm not feeling well..&quot; Boo mumbles. Very little
of the performance is an act. The jittering, shortness of breath, and
general look of unwellness is very typical.</p>
<p>Nass takes one look at their sad state and not even her usual
apathy prevents her from pressing the intercom. Right away an older
toad woman with a pink outfit, Mariam, arrives from the right wing.
&quot;This way deary.&quot;</p>
<p>Boo follows down those cold halls, hoping no one recognizes them
when someone speaks.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Run! Get your friends away from here too!</em>&quot;</p>
<p>Boo stops, teeth chattering. The nurse turns back. &quot;Everything
fine?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Run, dude! Actually, snatch the red letter on Nass's
desk since she's not there anymore, then run! Do it!</em>&quot; It's
a deep and soothing tone yet still frightening with no apparent
source.</p>
<p>Boo struggles to obey the voice, stumbling back to the lobby. The
red envelope is there on the desk miraculously. They pick it it up
and scan it over.</p>
<p><em>From: Jimmy M. of Mushroom Kingdom Disease Control Unit in
response of an anonymous tip to survey Mushroom Kingdom Hospital
East. In accordance to protocol 347a we counted about one-hundred
violations and we evacuated five patients that were turning green. By
the way, you'll be getting our bill soon.</em></p>
<p>&quot;Signed: James Monty, Richard Goomba, Parabilly Koopa,
Wiggletron Berry, Sebastian Bullet?&quot; Boo reads out loud.</p>
<p>The janitor leans up from vigorous mopping he did near the tables.
&quot;That knuckle head younger brother of mine was here? That
'splains it..&quot;</p>
<p>Boo slowly faces the paratroopa. &quot;Y-you know them?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yup. Home base just outta city limits. They raise ruckus on
purpose then wheel the sick to that Toadley Clinic in town. Mosey on
out youngin 'cause here comes the watch dogs!&quot;</p>
<p>Nass and a few others are coming back around the corner. With the
note held tight to their chest Boo gets out of there just in time.
With a start, Nass scoops up the MKDCU's empty envelope from the
floor.</p>
<p>&quot;How did this get off of my desk and where is the letter?&quot;
she pointedly asks the janitor.</p>
<p>&quot;Wind musta blew it away,&quot; Probabilly answers, seemingly
unbothered.</p>
<p>Doctor Professor snatches it out of her hands and rips it up. &quot;It
doesn't matter what happened because I know who is to blame anyway.
Okay? Now back to work. All of you!&quot;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Boo ran out to Luigi and Yoshi. &quot;They're at the T-toadley
Clinic!&quot; they squeaked while a noki who had just pulled up in a
sports car walked past the trio. The stranger had a flat but curious
face as he scurried by.</p>
<p>In walked Jelectro, taking in the scene of wet floor signs and
bleach in the air. Nass had switched her front desk shift and now
seated was Mariam in her pink spotted cap and matching nurse uniform.</p>
<p>&quot;Welcome to MK Hospital. You look like a healthy young man,&quot;
she spoke with an accent that seemed a little phony. The slight
harshness of the consonant reminded him of Dark Land actually.</p>
<p>&quot;Where is the information station? I'm not sick just a
tourist,&quot; he replied, suppressing his own.</p>
<p>&quot;From somewhere exotic?&quot; she inquired with some
mischievousness laced in. &quot;Down the hall to the left.&quot;</p>
<p>He played along and went down that hall then diverted as soon as
he wasn't being watched. He had on him a pseudo badge that could get
him in some important places as soon as he knew where to actually go.
All he knew was that Agent N's niece was somewhere inside. The
visitor section rose nearly to the ceiling with colorful pamphlets
showcasing the Mushroom Kingdom and surrounding. 'Have dinner at the
historic Club 64'. 'Come see the Southern hemisphere's famous yoshi
wrangling!' 'Take a tour through Boo's Mansion if you dare!' 'Book a
cruise to Isle Delfino', though Jelectro knew from just this morning
that the beaches weren't quite so commodious and tranquil and devoid
of screaming children like the images suggested.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Jelectro Bond. Come to room 26.</em>&quot;</p>
<p>The noki froze in his tracks, hands reaching to see if the
earplugs were there.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Aww, you really think those things stop your powers? If
you weren't so handsome I'd call you stupid.&quot;</em></p>
<p>&quot;Would you now?&quot; Jelectro snarked out loud and not
telepathically like he meant. The detective covered his mouth.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Just get to my room already.</em>&quot;</p>
<p>The noki debated running away and never returning. He'd do
anything rather than deal with a person like that, but he had to get
to the bottom of it all for Agent N's sake. Reluctantly he found his
way to the message's origin slowly pushed open the door. Inside was a
toad with a green cap under covers with his eyes shut. Bandages were
all over his face and his monitors indicated steady heart rate and
breathing.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Told you I don't bite. You know, I've met a telepathic
whomp, a mouser, not a little noki,&quot; </em>he said without
looking, or moving his mouth. &quot;<em>Did you like Sirena Beach,
French boy?</em>&quot;</p>
<p>Trying to keep a stony composure Jelectro stood beside the bed,
though inwardly he felt jitters all over. &quot;What happened to
you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Got hit by a bus. For once I do something proactive for
an old friend and- oh never mind, I'm not gonna complain. If you are
wondering about what's going on here it's horrible. Problem is only
Theodore knows the real details and who the conspirator is but that
wacko can block me out of his head somehow.</em>&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Doctor Professor Koopa. Just focus on this thug that
works for Bowser- the one who did this to me and it'll all come
together. Get to the press and get my stuff some kinda way but don't
tell Kylie I'm on the mends. Here's some details about me if someone
clocks you..Now find my papers on 'chimes'-</em>&quot;</p>
<p>With a grunt, Jelectro held the sides of his head as he
unpleasantly got the large bundle of information hot wired straight
to his brain. Feeling queasy and faint he fell backwards and into a
recliner in the room, nearly knocking it over.</p>
<p>&quot;Whoa! Sorry dude!&quot; Mitch said out loud for the first
time. &quot;&hellip; I didn't realize you had that atrophy of the
frontal lobe like-.&quot;</p>
<p>Jelectro blindly bolted out the patient room to be disoriented by
horrible buzzing from a hundred distorted voices he couldn't tune
out. Despite his best efforts as some sanity slipped back into him,
splotches of red dripped onto the white tiles as he stumbled a few
more steps into the lobby just time time to catch someone at the
service desk, a dark boo with a decidedly thuggish aura.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, no dearie they aren't around anymore. Nope,&quot; the
nurse told the boo, smiling but clearly intimidated.</p>
<p>&quot;Alright&hellip;&quot; he said sort of slick like. &quot;You
did not see me here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<em>I did not see you here</em>,&quot; the nurse droned back
with a sudden vacant expression.</p>
<p>The boo floated right back out through the automatic doors and
across the janitor stooping down near some tools he'd just used to
repair it.</p>
<p>&quot;Follow 'em.&quot; Probabilly said, inconspicuously watching
the noki with a nose bleed.</p>
<p>Jelectro caught the boo jumping on an old dirt bike and putting
off. He hopped in his own car and followed for a street before
loosing the zippy and maneuverable motorbike. Eventually he had to
give up and chase his next lead. There was no doubt about it however,
that was the 'thug'.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The princess's shoes instead of being embedded in the usual plush
sun pattern carpet were instead in a pool of shallow water, very
clear and crisp with a hint of shamrock smell.</p>
<p>&quot;It just blew up princess! The world exploded basically,&quot;
Toadette explained, gesturing to the sky or ceiling rather, the only
dry thing left.</p>
<p>Peach glanced all around somehow doubting that.</p>
<p>&quot;Good thing I'm here then, right? I'll see what I can do by
myself. Where did it start?&quot; Mario asked the group of toads
standing around in the water. There was Toadette, Yellow and Blue
Toad, another toad holding a spear, a few others and Toadsworth in
the background dragging water logged furniture from the inner rooms.</p>
<p>&quot;The kitchen. The basement. Upstairs. Outside. Inside. I
don't know I woke up underwater!&quot; they all answered at once.</p>
<p>Mario felt his head spinning. &quot;That can't be right!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right or wrong what I have now is a flooded castle, sick
friends, a backstabbing hospital, anxiety and a <em>soggy high heel</em>!&quot;
Peach exclaimed, finally unleashing her emotions and breaking down to
cry.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't feel bad, princess. Just be glad to be alive and
healthy! Some people aren't!&quot; the blue toad, Buckenberry said.</p>
<p>Peach's downcast expression softened. &quot;Thank you dear- I-I
suppose.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I mean, because just a few streets away there was a horrible
bus crash with one death and one serious injury. The dead guy's brain
melted! I heard it went everywhere!&quot; Buckenberry continued
obliviously until Toadette jabbed him with her elbow hard to shut up.</p>
<p>&quot;Where the chores at least completed this morning?&quot;
Peach nearly groaned. &quot;The ones I post up very clearly?&quot;
She got blank stares from everyone and sighed. &quot;One day I will
hire someone competent. Like Captain Toad!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Princess..&quot; Mario reached for her but she moved away.</p>
<p>&quot;Not now, Mario.&quot; The frustrated princess wadded through
the water to retreat into upper rooms. &quot;Toad was competent but
look at where he is now! If only a certain plumber's constant
dangerous activities with dangerous people didn't lead accidents like
this!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How is this my fault?&quot; Mario yelled at the door shut in
his face, confused as he was upset. He couldn't believe her attitude.
There were only a handful of people that would bicker with the
plumber since whether he wanted to admit it or not the general
attitude of most in the Mushroom Kingdom was to worship the ground he
stood on. Because of that even mild contention from friends had a
tendency to stun him. Well Mario knew he deserved it. He was right at
MK East yet he didn't get anything done for Toad or Daisy and the
head staff there didn't seem to respect him and they all shared and
accent- like they weren't from around the Mushroom Kingdom... Like
Bowser! Was he involved after all? But nothing really pointed to
that. He was getting the head spinning sensation again and let it go.</p>
<p>Mario did what he could for the next half hour, a pipe replacement
here, some bolt tightening there, a lot of duct tape, working as
quick as he could without getting sloppy. He did pride his plumbing
work. Suddenly his phone rang, making him jump. It was from 'lil bro'
as the call id stated. &quot;Talk to me, Luigi.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Actually this is Yoshi. Your brother handed me his phone so
he could finally understand it so here's a status report. Luigi had
all kinds of stuff going on, messages left and right, including one
Kylie Koopa finding some Fungus Up cans. Know about that? She thinks
Toad and or Daisy had them.&quot;</p>
<p>Mario scratched his head. &quot;I don't recall if they did or
not.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never mind that then. Big news: Toad and Daisy might be at
the Toadley Clinic so can you meet us there?&quot;</p>
<p>Mario held the phone upwards while basement water steadily rose to
his knees. &quot;Might be a moment. Do a guy a favor?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can do old friend. We'll check it out-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And have you seen Bowser around?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No. Why?&quot;</p>
<p>Mario paused.</p>
<p>Knowingly Yoshi continued, &quot;We'll keep our eyes peeled though
alright? Bye.&quot;</p>
<p>..</p>
<p>Luigi, Yoshi, and Boo have now walked to the Toadley Clinic, not
far from the castle or hospital. They had to avoid Starman Lane due
to the clean up and investigation still going on. Yoshi is especially
disturbed by what reports on the Toad Town online message boards
mention about the sole occupant in the bus apparently being deceased
<em>before</em> he veered into incoming traffic. The dinosaur tries
to shake it off, to be strong. Now the mushroom shaped building is
before them and he lets Luigi walk in first. The Toadley clinic has
an area with seating and an intern waiting at the desk. The rest is
walled off behind double doors.</p>
<p>&quot;Welcome, do you have an appointment?&quot; she asks right
away, a younger toad woman with blonde medium length hair.</p>
<p>Luigi rushes to the desk. &quot;No, not really.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well that'll be a problem-&quot; she starts before a voice
booms from behind those doors.</p>
<p>&quot;Do I take patients without appointment? No I do not!&quot;</p>
<p>Boo shrieks and hides behind Yoshi. Yoshi looks to Luigi then to
the intern. &quot;How long will it take to make one then? We just
want to know if some friends are checked in here.&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi nods. &quot;Toad Toad and Daisy Bloom. We think some health
agents transferred them here.&quot;</p>
<p>The intern nodded back quickly. &quot;James did send them here. In
fact his crew just left for a late lunch. Did you have any
questions?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah! What's wrong with them?&quot;</p>
<p>The intern plays with her pen. &quot;...Maybe the doctor could
explain.&quot; She presses a buzzer. &quot;I'm sending them anyway!&quot;
she yells.</p>
<p>&quot;Arrgh! Must I allow if you insist? I must. Come in!&quot;</p>
<p>Cautiously the three enter those double doors where it is much
darker. A large room has beds along with their friends and a few more
on them. The titular doctor dressed in purple is on the other side of
the area where a shrine of sorts is set up. In the middle of shelves
of various herbs and powders is a table with a laptop on it. The
wallpaper of that laptop is the round crystal.</p>
<p>&quot;Can I answer anything? Yes I can. What do you inquire?&quot;</p>
<p>Luigi steps up after gulping. &quot;..What's wrong with Toad and
Daisy?&quot;</p>
<p>Dr. Toadley presses the internet browser icon. The answer appears
on screen 'miraculously' and much more quicker and accurately than
the doctors old method of supposedly knowing everything. &quot;They
have the Mushroom Flu and there is no cure on file and I have no idea
how they and the other test subjects- ah hem patients got it-&quot;</p>
<p>Yoshi and Boo gasps.</p>
<p>&quot;-YET! But will I find it? Yes I will! I am currently working
night and day doing nothing else but finding that cure!&quot;</p>
<p>Peering at something, Luigi raises one finger. &quot;Is that a
computer game open?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Luigi!&quot; Yoshi yells.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm just saying!&quot;</p>
<p>As they speak, Boo inches closer and closer to those beds,
something beckoning them for a closer look. One is a red yoshi girl
who seems to be a child laying back, skin pale and with a sicking
green hue. The others are the same including Toad and Daisy in the
far corner. Boo has no idea why they tried to be brave all a sudden.
So panicked, they float past Yoshi and Luigi who calls out for them
and out of the entire clinic.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&quot;So you don't wanna this time?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wanna hang out with you? No, weirdo,&quot; replied the first
responder Dave, a handsome Boom Boom about three years Emery's senior
who always wore an army jacket and got off from the helicopters with
a smug laugh. He got the fly that thing all over so who blamed him?</p>
<p>Emery T. sighed and got back to work staring at the clouds.</p>
<p>&quot;Miss Emery,&quot; said someone behind her. Doctor Professor
Koopa arms crossed, stood there with a bored looking lakitu beside
him. &quot;Log out of your workstation.&quot;</p>
<p>Emery did as he said. &quot;Am I taking another break?&quot; she
asked, walking down stairs and noting that the lakitu was taking her
position. She was led all the way down to the doctor's office. Doctor
Professor closed the door behind her with an ominous click.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you aware of a certain Sebastian Bullet?&quot;</p>
<p>Emery smiled weakly. &quot;Maybe?&quot;</p>
<p>Doctor Professor sat down at his oak desk, fingers clasped. &quot;Then
are you aware of how unscrupulous service reports harm this facility.
Of course you are, smart girl.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I don't know about that other stuff.&quot; She shrugged.</p>
<p>Doctor Professor tilted his head down a little, smiling. &quot;I
am an old man you know that, but not a stupid one and I know how
these doohickeys operate.&quot; He held up Emery's cellphone that she
didn't even realize had been confiscated. &quot;You are fired.&quot;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Bowser had one foot in the clown car that got him to the Mushroom
Kingdom. He was just about to leave Toad Town for Dark Land and just
let the entire tennis game go as a write off. It was almost
disappointing. Almost. Someone called him and instantly he knew it
wasn't his children or Kamek or his old lady Clawdia. <em>Especially</em>
not the later... &quot;Yeah, this is Bowser&hellip; Oh fangirl chick
again. What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I got *sniff* like totally fired!&quot; Emery explained,
sitting on the sidewalk outside. She knew mother wasn't getting off
work for a while or even acknowledge her termination so she was
stranded for the umpteenth time in her life.</p>
<p>Bowser figured that. &quot;Keep going gal.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Like, can I work for you?&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser paused for a minute. &quot;I know I said I liked ya, but
what will that do for me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lots of stuff! I'm a toad so like I can be within thirty
meters of the princess and you can't, for starters.&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser gaped at the revelation. &quot;Tell me where you are 'cause
I'm picking you up!&quot; The clown car's propellers soon made the
vehicle soar. Wind and grass blew right into the eyes of the person
whose motor bike was just pulling up. The biker beat a fist against
the handle bar but then thought of a new plan so they revved up again
and head towards Royal Raceway.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>To forget that experience with Mitch Toad Jelectro decided to dive
right into work. He returned to the Mushroom Press with a fool proof
idea on how to walk in and get the items of that popular gossip
writer, forty-one, 'single', living in a complex around Pleasant
Path.. He kept reciting those facts, just in case he was quizzed.</p>
<p>&quot;Nice to see you again,&quot; Jessie at the front desk
greeted.</p>
<p>&quot;Same. I need to pick up some items of Mitch Jamerson Toad.
I'm actually his intern.&quot;</p>
<p>Jessie hummed with a thinly veiled spark of jealousy.
&quot;Interesting. I just thought he was lone wolf these days.. He's
a local public figure and others try to steal his stories so you
don't mind can you prove that you really know him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He is forty-one, writes for the Mushroom Enquirer-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Other than what you can easily find on his website,&quot;
Jesse laughed. &quot;Something personal.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Personal?...&quot; Jelectro hesitated at the sole intimate
detail he had to spout. &quot;He has hanging in his bedroom behind
the bed stand a life sized picture signed by celebrity Zip Toad.&quot;</p>
<p>The desk woman's face flushed. &quot;You've been in his?- I knew
he was a two timing little!- Ah hem.&quot; The human combed her hair
back down that was standing on edge. &quot;Go ahead...&quot;</p>
<p>Jelectro quickly walked away from that disaster of a situation and
proceeded to the empty cubical space that had Mitch's golden name
plate on it. He dug into a cabinet full of manila folders labeled
'aliens', 'ufo', 'super abilities' 'the stars', etc and finally
'artifacts' which had a 'chimes' subfolder. So intently he searched
he didn't notice someone standing right behind him.</p>
<p>&quot;Excuse me, sir. What are you doing with his stuff?&quot;
Kylie asked.</p>
<p>Jelectro froze with the files in hand. &quot;...I'm Mitch's
intern?&quot;</p>
<p>She stared at him hard then snapped her fingers. &quot;Neat. He'd
been weird lately so I can see him doing something he doesn't usually
do like outsourcing his garbage. No offense.&quot;</p>
<p>Jelectro stiffly nodded. &quot;I'm Jelectro and I'm not from
around.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly by your peppiness. No offense again. Nice to meet
ya.&quot; She shook his hand and he shook back, unaware until then
that he was peppy apparently. &quot;Where is he? Not to be nosy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He's taking an impromptu vacation and but wants an article
on the hospital so I needed to pick things up for him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well I'm investigating the same thing for the Mario bros but
for the truth rather than gossip magazines. Okay, I'll stop teasing
ya! I've been to the tennis stadium so I was going to visit the
hospital their friends were said to be at.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's on some sort of lock down but I don't really
know how that works,&quot; he mentioned, belying his understanding of
the situation.</p>
<p>&quot;Darn. I have contact with Luigi so maybe lets just get to
the princess.&quot; She stood up with shoulder bag over her shell,
patiently waiting for the 'intern's' response. &quot;I can't believe
I'm working with a Mitch associate, but there's something about this
case I feel I'm missing. Something big. You know what I mean?&quot;</p>
<p>Jelectro remained stuck in place, feeling a disturbance from far
off. &quot;I know exactly what you mean.&quot;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Someone far away there was a digital clock on the wall with the
red LEDs being the only source of light in the room as a dark figure
observed intensely. Without warning the digit went down from 12:00 to
11:59. It was time to make a move. One person whispered into the ear
of another and another. Soon the entire population of the nearly
ancient building in the desert knew but they chose to not let the
secret slip yet...</p>

<p>
Mario
tossed aside his wrench. It landed with a soft sounding clink on
tiled floors marred with his boot prints. Water mostly drained, he
leaned away from underneath the cabinets.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Great
job saving us from killing our selves, you know like usual,&quot;
said the blue toad observing closely the work. Buckenberry
semi-famous for volunteering for 'New Super Mario Bros' often
breathed down his neck unless Luigi was around to shoo him away.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Mario
leaned on top the cabinet, surveying the patch job one more time.
&quot;What do you want, Cool Blue?&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Luigi
called the castle. Mr. Toad and Princess Daisy have the Mushroom Flu.
Mario? Mario, wait!&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Mario
tumbled out of the kitchen. He quickly tore the castle up looking for
Peach but only found her toads cleaning up damp floors and furniture.
&quot;Mr. Toadsworth, have you seen the princess?&quot; he demanded,
spotting the old mushroom gazing out the open front doors.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Toadsworth
tapped his cane with a downward face. &quot;I tried prevent her rash
endeavors, Master Mario. She wished to revisit that hospital of doom
and I would have accompanied her but dear me, I am too traumatized by
that bus accident that happened to deathly near here. The roads and
no longer safe!&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Mario
checked outside with mixture of irritation and concern. &quot;You
don't have to worry about that because she didn't even take her
car..&quot; Peach's pink Birthday Girl kart was untouched in the
castle lot. He slapped his forehead and sprinted away from the castle
with no further explanation given.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Toadsworth
watched and waited and waited some more, eyelids drooping lower. He
then asked some one else to guard the door while he left to prepare
hot tea for concentration. Despite his request no one did, the
typical clemency becoming common in the castle as the princess became
less and less authoritarian with age. But that was a debate for
later. Soon someone rapped on the door which alerted the toads in
expectation of the pizza guy or a gift from one of the princess's
admirers that they'd get to dig into first. Or something from Amazon.
A teenaged toad swung open the door.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Hey.
What's up?&quot; The dark boo attempted it seemed to smile
reassuringly, yet his jagged teeth and devious squint directed at the
castle's address posted up in a bold but regal font hinted otherwise.
There wasn't an obvious mode of transportation he'd arrived via.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
OOOOO-k..
Well you don't have pizza or a Prime shipment so bye?..&quot; Thomas
attempted to shut the door, but the visitor held it open with sudden
strength.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Listen
to this, bro. I got a rare thing.&quot; The boo presented in his
other hand a can of soda that was dented but unopened, Fungus Up.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Uhhhh
whatever...&quot; Thomas groaned, letting him in flippantly.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Thanks
bro. Peach collects memorabilia doesn't she? And Mario's here too
right?&quot; The dark boo brushed past him into lobby, his expression
flattening when his gaze raised at the ceiling. He clicked his
tongue. &quot;...They ain't here.&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Excuse
me, who are you?&quot; Toadette appeared in the dark boo's way when
he lowered his head. She'd came from upstairs.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
He
collects stuff&hellip; maybe...&quot; Thomas shrugged as their
visitor began to slip out the castle.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Stop
that guy! He's totally suspicious!&quot; Toadette yelled like a
siren.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Buckenberry
bust from a room hurled himself towards the stranger. In a ball both
tumbled out the door and flat onto the stone moat. The boo then
punched the blue toad in the face before knocking him off.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Piss
off,&quot; the boo spat, dragging himself up.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Buckenberry
ignored his busted lip and charged again. The boo 'pointed' at him
and something undetectable by their senses struck the blue toad. His
world spun like a vortex, making him launch himself over the railing
to splash into the clear water below. Seeing their toughest toad go
down roused the onlookers. Peach's toads weren't obsequious, or the
best at jumping in platform games, or the best at cleaning, but they
cared about each other and in numbers their confidence grew
exponentially. Toadette, Thomas, a toad who ran the castle's visitor
podium, Yellow Toad known also as Ala-Gold, the gardener with a hoe,
a cook with a metal pan, and many more poured from the doors like
scurrying insects. The dark boo dragged a bike hidden off the side
with him, attempting to crank it up when he realized someone was
helping him roll it. He whipped around to find Alagold.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Sweeet,
ride brah! What's your name?&quot; he asked innocently.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Bro?!&quot;
Zoo gasped.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Your
name is 'Brah'?&quot; Alagold's eye began to twitch as he detected an
item, his special gift he used a lot in NSMB. He reached into a
compartment on the bike and took out a Dark Land identification. &quot;No,
your name is Z-&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Gimme
that back!&quot; 'Z' yelled in his face.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
He
raised an arm again and sent an intangible biology tampering wave
slicing through Alagold. The yellow toad seized up and stiffly
collapsed on the road while Z escaped, on edge anew when Thomas's
hurled spear, bestowed to him as technically the front door guard,
nearly impaled him. Then the others threw rocks that pelted the dark
boo relentlessly. His motorbike refused to start up as the toads
slowly became a monstrous regiment close to overtaking Z. The entire
castle was involved in chasing him off. He dropped his motorbike all
together and, nerves getting the best of the young boo, did something
drastic.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Trying
to ignore the ruckus from whatever was going outside, the restless
young ones these days!- Toadsworth blew over the hot ceramic cup of
Herb Tea. He relaxed in a recliner up stairs in his room, his
sanctuary. Before taking the first sip, a violent rumble shook the
cup out of his hand and tea all over his lap. He clinched his teeth
as his shelves rattled heavy books to the floor. He sprung up and to
a window. Outside was only a pure black abyss Toadsworth peered into.
A vision was forced upon him, that of a single five pointed object
hanging above barren flattened land and the Princess' Castle in
ruins. He screamed until he felt his lungs giving out.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
...</font></font></font></p>
<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="letter-spacing: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">Boo
heard their name being called when Luigi and Yoshi poked their heads
into Club Gamecube, Club 64's competitor established in 2001. Boo
wanted to respond but remained frozen. They slapped themselves in the
forehead again. &quot;Why can't you do anything right, Boo? Why?&quot;
When not pathetically tagging along with someone more important all
they had was a lame part time job at a diner in Forever Forest, a
Youtube channel no one watched but their mother,&nbsp;</span></span></span></font></font></font></span><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="letter-spacing: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">no

Not all of that was bad but they were fully convinced they were
useless.</span></span></span></font></font></font></span></p>
<p>
Give
a round of applause for Dolphin!&quot; the manager said on stage,
introducing a comedian. The lights went dim as some people were
loudly entering the restaurant.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
I
just want a Chuckola Cola, the Japanese version. Mom never let me do
this.&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
I
ain't her am I, so you'll get it! Waiter?! We need service!&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Boo
peered over a banister that separated the dining area from the front
to see Bowser and a toad girl at the takeout desk. Emery received her
beverage after Bowser flashed his ID card for her and they left. Two
minutes later, tugged along into action by some part of themselves
unknown, Boo was zipping between alleys following the slow but steady
Clown Car in the air. Boo weaved through more people on sidewalks and
narrowly avoided traffic on streets.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
In
the air, Emery belched. &quot;Awesome! Uh, what to do with-&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Toss
the bottle over the side. It ain't littering, it's a custom where I'm
from.&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Boo
then watched as something glistening in the sky fell over the edge
and whacked them in their forehead. The little boo collapsed in the
middle of Toad Town park.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
...</font></font></font></p>
<p>
A
silver Aston Mushroom continued its steady pace towards Peach's
Castle, each mile tense for the noki driver within. Would the koopa
passenger stop staring at him? If Kylie Koopa made the mistake of
leaning over him the right way, easily due to his small height, she
might catch a glimpse of what was behind his sunglasses and he
couldn't have that.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Can
you read this?&quot; he asked, handing her Mitch's file to direct her
attention away.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Kylie
opened it up in her lap. &quot;An old case study on ancient
artifacts. You interested in something specific?&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Something
capable of a 'chime'?&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
That
narrows it down&hellip; Off topic but can I ask you something?&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Hm?&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
I
know species names are a hit these days but how did you end up being
called Jelectro when you're a noki?&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Before
he could answer he slammed the breaks a few feet before displaced
toads on the road. Papers flew all over the car. Just across the
bridge of Royal Raceway, Peach's Castle was suspended a few hundred
meters in the sky on top a pure black and flatly textured disc.
Faintly yellow hologram like musical notes drizzled underneath like a
rain shower. They collectively jumped when someone banged driver's
window. It was Buckenberry still soggy and wet. Jelectro rolled it
down.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Finally
someone drives down this road! Get Mario's help!&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Kylie
Koopa jumped out of the car. &quot;What the crap?! Where's the
princess?&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
She's
not in,&quot; Toadette explained quietly, shock very evident on her
and others stranded about.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Well,
Mr. Toadsworth was inside when that freak with the bell did this. He
screwed up Gold too!&quot; Buckenberry warned, referring to someone a
little farther back laying face down in the grass.</font></font></font></p>
<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="letter-spacing: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">Jelectro
investigated the yellow toad as his special training took over. He

craned his neck her way but remained planted in the car. Kylie was
snapping pictures of an old motorbike. &quot;You know something? I've
saw this bike parked at the Mushroom Press this morning. Yeah I'm
sure it was. Someone give me the straight dope on this guy.&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
A
thug. A dark boo. A young adult. Some scars. Squinted all the time.
'Z',&quot; the toads all answered.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Kylie
let the camera dangle freely around her neck. &quot;...What was that
last one again?&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
...</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Peach's
shoes or high heels, dry ones that was, clacked rapidly as she stomp
down the sidewalk, arms swinging in rhythm. She'd reached her limit
of secrets, lies, plumbers, and koopas who constantly inserted
themselves into her life despite a so-called Peace Pact between
kingdoms. She spotted the Koopa copter hovering her way and quickened
her pace when something else approached, a taxi speeding down the
street. Peach instinctively dove into the nearest dark alley as the
cab pulled over to the side of the road to let someone jump out back
seat.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Princess,
don't you know how dangerous that was with weirdos and such after
you? Just look at that! At least have your cellphone on,&quot;
lectured Mario.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Peach
stepped out of the alley, grimy and dress splattered with dirt. &quot;I
knew what I was doing, my dear Mario,&quot; she responded icily. Both
turned their heads at the rabid toad girl holding a lit bob-omb
running their way.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Diiiiiie
princess!&quot; screamed the girl.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Mario
stared at her vacantly before letting his foot out so that she
tripped over his toes and completely overshot Peach. The girl rolled
on the sidewalk and the bomb even farther away in front of a
building.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
That
was weird.&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Yeah,
for once you're right plumber boy,&quot; growled Bowser from the
lowering Koopa Clown copter. &quot;Anyway, I spotted Peach wandering
around but then my new mook had to mess it up..&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Sorry
Bowser...&quot; Emery mumbled from the pavement. The bomb went off
and shattered some windows of the post office.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Is
everyone alright?!&quot; wailed Parakarry, bursting out those doors.
He saw Emery on the ground and sighed in relief. &quot;Stop trying to
be a terrorist. You aren't good at it,&quot; he remarked bluntly.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
You
know this traitor?&quot; Peach asked.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Mario's
ex partner nodded. &quot;She works at the hospital and is always
posting these Bowser propaganda fliers in the mail. I still send them
out of course, a postman can't be biased. See y'all!&quot; Smiling,
he returned to the post office.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
How
ridiculous that a Toad Town citizen work with Bowser,&quot; Mario
said with some disgust.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
It's
a free kingdom, mustache. Lay off! Besides you partner with me, how's
that different?&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Emery
peeled her face up from the asphalt. &quot;Ouch. Clearly I'm not
wasted like I thought cause I totally felt that. Are we still going
to the clinic?&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Mario
snapped his fingers. &quot;That's perfect, 'little traitor girl'!&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
I
have a name!&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Whatever.
That's where we need to go for real results, not that other
hospital,&quot; Mario said. &quot;And I know that's where you were
going Peach.&quot; She didn't respond to that vexingly.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Bowser
scoffed. &quot;So what? You idiots hitch a ride with me? Yeah right!&quot;
he howled. He lowered his head and Mario was giving him that look
again.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
They
have the Mushroom Flu.&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
A
jolt went through Bowser's system. &quot;...Get in. NOW!&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Everyone
squeezed in his koopa copter including Peach, uncomfortable so close
to Bowser and his deranged sidekick. Well, as long as she was even
closer to Mario it could be tolerable. She didn't want to admit it
but she did need him and she knew it was mutual no matter how many
times they annoyed each other. Soaring a short distance over the
villa, anyone on the ground scattered like ants at the sight of the
koopa aircraft.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Alright
now everyone except fangirl get out quick! Go go!&quot; Bowser forced
Mario and Peach out after landing before the clinic. &quot;Watch the
clown car.&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Yes
sir!&quot; Emery saluted.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
The
intern inside screamed when they came in, making her chair flip.
&quot;B-Bowser?! Birdley, get him!&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
A
white bird perched on a hanging cage swooped down at Bowser, smacking
in his face and making a poof of feathers explode from impact.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Bowser's
with us,&quot; Peach explained reluctantly. &quot;Doctor please?&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
The
intern pointed backwards. She went through the double doors and
located her inexplicably green skinned friends right away on the
cots.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Dr.
Toadley spun away from the computer. &quot;Quiz time. Is Mushroom Flu
a localized virus? Yes it is.&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Peach
tore her gaze away. &quot;Localized? From where?&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Bowser
barged in, feathers stuck to him everywhere and still spitting some
out. &quot;Just great. I swallowed one&hellip; Anyway they can't have
the Mushroom Flu 'cause people only get that in Dark Land! Lots of us
are allergic to mushrooms there.&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Mario
walked in last. &quot;Didn't you both confirm Doctor Professor worked
in Dark Land? He would have known this.&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Yeah
he should have known I guess.&quot; Bowser's arms crossed and his
mind drifted somewhere he didn't want.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Peach
yanked Mario her way in a sudden fit. &quot;Mario? I knew that
advanced testing from that horrible 'doctor' was just an excuse to
waste our precious time!&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
I
know that too! How did they deal with this in Dark Land, Bowser?&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Bowser
glared back at the plumber. &quot;Your clone Dr. Mario dealt with it
way back. DO I LOOK LIKE A DOCTOR?! But that Doctor Professor Koopa
was working in my castle at the time so he should of known what was
going since this morning if this purple lunatic right here could
figure it out in minutes! Stop looking at me like that! Your hospital
is what's messed up right now so shut it down!&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
The
room got silent, Mario reflected a lot of things he'd done all day,
granted for only a few seconds, but enough to know it was time to try
something new. Or old. &quot;Alright. Let's forget our history for a
moment.&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Bowser's
eyebrows rose a little. &quot;..What? That's a heck of a lot to
forget, mustache.&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Mario
held out his hand with an exasperated but wryly sigh. &quot;Shut up
and let's fix this together already.&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
The
princess rolled her eyes. &quot;Mario.&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Peach.&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Bowser
paused before squeezing Mario's hand hard. &quot;Fine. We're both at
a loss here anyway. After all, it's all about the tennis game and the
gold medal! Who cares about these other losers?&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Uh,
well actually-&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
-Shuddup.
Doc? What else you got to tell us?&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Toadley
spun the computer monitor towards them with 1s and 0s flying in
space. Very impressive. Of course Dr. Toadley jiggled the mouse and
what was actually the screensaver faded away, revealing a plain
webpage of patient entry forms Toadley procured by digging through
insecure servers of a certain mushroomy eastern hospital.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
What
was the last beverage consumed? A soda, Fungus Up.&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Mario
nodded. &quot;Kylie Koopa told Luigi that she found some cans outside
Toad and Daisy's locker rooms.&quot; His head tilted slightly lower.
&quot;Eh, guess I shouldn't of been so harsh with him over hiring
her..&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Will
I contact the Special World Hospital for advice? Yes I will.&quot;
The toad doctor whistled and Birdley entered the backroom on cue.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Bowser
dived flat to the floor, covering his head. &quot;Keep that winged
psycho away from me!&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Mario
and Peach shuddered. The International Medical University of Special
World was a remote and specialized research facility located beyond
Star Road as the name suggested. Rumor had it that they took test
subjects only for them to never see the light of day again. Plus they
were nerds... Peach approved hesitantly then decided to make use of
her cellphone for once for her own revenge on the hospital with the
audacity to oust her. She was a princess after all.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
...</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Luigi
scanned his surroundings one last time in the search for his boo pal.
He should not have forgotten that he himself wasn't someone willing
to go on Mario's adventures initially. The acceptance of such great
responsibility, the get to the point where risking his life was a
mundane sometimes 'fun' activity, came very gradually. An average
person, someone like boo wouldn't grasp that in a day. He and Yoshi
traversed the Toad Town sidewalks in growing desperation. Things were
so normal all around, bright evening sky, warm weather, and
pedestrians on the streets. It made their problems seem so small and
isolated in the grand scheme.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
I'm
sorry.&quot; Yoshi pat him on the back. &quot;Earlier, back when we
first infiltrated that twisted hospital I spoke to Boo for a moment.
I can tell he or she has, well, some issues.&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
And
I made them worse.&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Don't
get too bent out of shape. Some people keep their issues to
themselves and if they do, how can you know?&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Luigi
thought he detected traces of inward frustration from Yoshi then.
They crossed through the large park as a shortcut. Denizens were sun
bathing in the open spots in-between shade trees. Luigi and Yoshi
tiptoed around them, including a little boo near an empty glass
bottle.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Luigi
dove down and shook the boo. &quot;Buddy! It's Luigi wake up!&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Boo's
eyes fluttered open while rubbing the red bruise on their head.
&quot;...Where am I?&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Luigi
helped them up. &quot;Park. It's my fault. If this is too intense for
you we'll get you home.&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Boo
scanned the plumber up and down curiously. &quot;But why would I want
to go home? By the way, it's 'Booigi the second'.&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Yoshi
got a closer look at the knot then suspiciously picked up the glass
Chuckola Cola bottle, dreading what he was about to ask. &quot;..That
head injury and- You weren't drinking were you?&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
No.
I was tracking Bowser and..&quot; Booigi let their words settle in
the air. &quot;...I don't remember, but the heck does it matter?
Let's kick Bowser's butt! That's what we're here for!&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Luigi
was stunned all over. &quot;Boo, what are you saying? We-&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Stop
talking. I hear something.&quot; Booigi leered at a more wooded area.
Trees and foliage rustled as a tired looking dark boo approached...</font></font></font></p>
<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="letter-spacing: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">...Kylie
rushed back inside the press where many had clocked out for home by
now, darting to the amateur side and the space of Susie Que. She dug
in their desk but nothing was left, only a small decorative painting.
It had a red backdrop that spiraled to a black splotch in the middle,
edgily titled '</span></span></span></font></font></font></span><em><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="letter-spacing: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">I'm

by artist 'Drew'. The computer had beneath its screen saver an
internet browser left on a flash games website, like the person
goofed off all morning.</span></span></span></font></font></font></span></p>
<p>
Kylie
knocked on the door of Steve's office. &quot;Did Susie ever return?&quot;
A typewriter the bullet bill used clacked away, audible through the
closed door.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Time
clock says no,&quot; he grunted back.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Kylie
spun back around as Jelectro was walking in. &quot;You contact Mario
with our office phone. His number is posted on the board. I gotta
check something.&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Jelectro
found the office phone tucked away in a semi-isolated spot where a
five gallon water dispenser was. The beige note tacked to the cork
board said 'Call this for Mario, or this' with two numbers written.
He chose the first and it picked up right away.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
HELLO?&quot;
A pure black and particle like appendage jetted out from the speaker
and wrapped tightly around Jelectro's neck.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Merde!&quot;
he squeaked as the phone slipped to the floor. No one around him had
any reaction to the noisy struggle as if he was invisible. The
creature knocked the noki back into the water dispenser again and
again, toppling the stacks of paper cups and splashing the floor. He
mustered all of his strength to pry it from his windpipe, growing
feeble by the micro second. Out of options, he attacked the 'thing'
mentally with his incredibly rusty telepathic prowess. With a low
rumble the dark matter phased away from his pale palms, leaving
everything normal except a giant puddle of water and a nose bleed.
Someone frantically pulled the blue faced noki back to his feet.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Are
you alright?&quot; Jessie propped him up and began to remove his
sunglasses before his arms shot out and stopped her.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Don't
touch that- I mean, I passed out because where I come from.. we don't
have conveniences such as this..&quot; Jelectro shakily grabbed a
paper cup and dispensed some water in it before taking a little sip.
&quot;Ahhh&hellip;&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Where?&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Canada,
mon ami.&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
No
I mean you're bleeding- well, alright..&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
He
snatched a wad of facial tissues pressed quickly to his upper lip and
glanced at the phone with malice. &quot;Just allergies. Petit
b&acirc;tard&hellip;.&quot; he muttered. After a second he chuckled
at his own insult to the phone, that very phrase often directed at
him growing up.. He scrutinized the bulletin note again and,
surprise, that first number was actually labeled as Peach Castle's
number while the second was Mario's cell phone. He called that.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Hello?
Why is the newspaper company calling right now?&quot; Mario
responded.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Bonjour.
I am an intern of a reporter and there was an incident at the
princess's castle. Her servants are homeless now.&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
The
line went silent before Mario exclaimed, &quot;How did I miss all of
these notifications from your toads, Peach?! Look at this!&quot; Then
Mario's line disconnected.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
There
was another curious detail then, the office phone had logs of call
history to Mushroom Kingdom Hospital and exactly one return call back
with a message left hours ago. Jelectro snooped into that, playing
the record out with low volume.</font></font></font></p>

<p>
Bond,
does it take five minutes to operate a phone?! Come over here!&quot;
Kylie beckoned him, buried in her computer research. &quot;Twelve
years ago in Donut Plains there was a 'Zoo Diddley', the son of a
popular at the time juggler. Zoo rung a very special object one day
in the middle of an act and something really bad went down. Mitch
heard of the story back then and it left an impression for a personal
reason. Anyway, I'm positive Susie is Zoo, but why pretend to be a
reporter? His current vocation is listed as custodian.&quot; She spun
her chair around and had a double take at how quickly the sorta
attractive intern deteriorated. &quot;Are you okay?&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Still
holding the tissues to his face that were thoroughly bled through,
Jelectro had the office phone under his arm. &quot;Interesting.&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
What?
No, I'm asking you,&quot; she replied quizzically.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Interesting
because this morning right before you met 'Susie' for the first time
a stand of the sodas appeared for 'free' in the park, a pallet's
worth dropped off by a truck according to message boards. Who owns
the largest truck company around? Koopas. If Susie is actually Zoo
and has been confirmed to attack Peach's castle, could Zoo be
associated with the koopas? Bowser's castle is a dump as we all know,
but likely he still has non-combatant staff such as janitors. Would
Bowser association not be a motivation to compromise the sodas that
we know Toad and Daisy drank, and the hospital holding those sick
from that very thing?&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Alright
Batman,&quot; she chuckled, &quot;I was getting to all that. We
better check Koopa now and- Uh, why did you yank our phone from the
wall though?&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Because
it is the key to-&quot; Jelectro felt a sting in this forehead and
held it, trembling. &quot;I have to go! Now!&quot; He stepped away
then stopped, facing Kylie again. &quot;Actually, accompany me!&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
She
sprung up from her seat galvanized by the panic in his tone. &quot;Sure?
You have to leave the phone though. Company policy and those pidgits
in corporate are scary!&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
More
than this?&quot; Jelectro suddenly raised a silenced pistol from his
pocket, making anyone remaining inside scream and dive under tables
and desks.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
I
was kidding about the Batman thing, brother!&quot; Kylie shot her
arms up. Stuck between him and her own cubical there was no where to
run. &quot;Now what the heck do you really want from us?&quot;</font></font></font></p>
<p>
Est-ce
que je ne parle pas anglais? I thought not, so let's go!&quot;
Jelectro hissed while grimacing from stabbing pain.</font></font></font></p>
