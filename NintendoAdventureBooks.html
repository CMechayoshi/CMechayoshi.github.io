<p> Hello and
welcome to my guides for the Nintendo Adventure Books. For some background, I first
collected some of these back in 2007 when they were only a few bucks
on Amazon. Now they cost several times that! I physically owned three initially (Monster Mix-up, Leaping Lizards, and Brain Drain) but have since collected a few more which I prefer to use but if I must use digital copies I will and it will be noted. Follow the key below:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Page and Chapter: The page number gets emphasis over chapter because in these
books you are sent to pages not chapters. Even if a chapter lasts a
few pages it will be refered to as the first page it's on just
to avoid confusion. This applies to puzzles too. If page one's
puzzle is appears on page four it will be called page one's
puzzle.
	<li>Description: Just a summary of the page's events.
	<li>Puzzle: If the chapter has a puzzle to solve.
	<li>Gameover: If this chapter is a dead end.
	<li>Rewards: If the chapter gives the reader an item or points.
	<li>Buffet: This removes an item or coins or whatever from the reader. Less common.
	<li>Splits: Where the chapter branches off to.
	<li>Path: What pages lead to this chapter. A 'loop-back' page will logically have lots of paths.
	<li>Puzzle solution: The solution to a puzzle if present and/or general tips on
how the reader should proceed and what to  be aware of. This may
appear on a page/chapter that has no puzzle.
</ul>

<p>Other things I will go over is the optimal path, that is what I feel is the
<em>best</em> path of from start to end, of course what is 'best' depends on the book. It could be
the path that will take the reader to the end as soon as possible
with the item(s) needed without loop-backing back or something more of what the book expects. Usually to get the
highest score in most books you must veer off in some way to aquire the
extra coins/points needed. Calculating that can get tricky so how deep I go into scoring will depend on the book.
Some books have reset switches too, making it infinite!</p>


<p><strong>Pressing the F3 or equivalent for your browser will be a must to navigate.</strong> For clarity's sake when speaking of a page within a paragraph I will spell out numbers to not clutter up search results.
I will also attempt some color coding to make it easier to visually map paths. Last we have statistics such as the items obtainable, the amount of endings,
max coins possible and summaries. Errors will be pointed out if I find any in the book, such as swapped puzzle solutions. Please enjoy, I'm not an expert book mapper so this was at times an effort to map out by hand but worth it for something no one else has done to my knowledge. Contact me using one of the accounts listed on the homepage if there are any errors I've made. Thank you.</p>

<h2>Types of puzzles in Nintendo Adventure Books</h2>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Decipher: You are given either symbols or something else to decipher a message for an answer or a hint, using a key provided or counting backwards from alphabets or marking out certain letters to read out the rest, etc..
			<li>Word search: And actual word search puzzle where you find words with a word bank hopefully provided (sometimes it’s not) or crossword puzzle.
			<li>Maze: You wind through a maze to reach a stopping point. These can often lead to dramatic things depending on where you land. Alternatively these might grant coins and have a variable score situation. I'm also going to consider puzzles where you pick a path to be this as well.
			<li>‘Get a straight edge, dummmy’: Or at least a ruler. A visual puzzle where you must determine something from the illustration, if something lines up, how objects compare, etc. The name sounds disparaging but it’s actually part a quote from Double Trouble (well, minus the insult). These can be trickier than they might seem so mentally calculate with care if you don’t use a ruler.
			<li>Just a hint: More of the result of a puzzle, meant to go with the other types. This is just a hint of something up coming and sometimes not even that, it might just be a tidbit about something.
			<li>Spot the difference: You are given matching items to spot the differences between, a visual thing but not involving mental calculations. That would be below.
			<li>You can’t get this score!: A results page for if you get an erroneous score from another page.
			<li>Math and logic: A less common type where some simple logic and/or math must be used to find the answer. The visual ones can be interesting and tricky where you have to mentally rotate objects and more.
			<li>Other: Anything else.		
		</ul>
	</p>
	
<h2>Other terms used:</h2>	
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Loop back path: Multiple pages link these functioning as a way to give the reader a chance to take another route, a chance to get an item, or a milder punishment for getting a puzzle wrong or making bad choices depending on book. This is not the same as a reset.
			<li>Reset: A reset, usually not labeled as such in story (except in Monster Mix-up) but effectively starting over the book by sending you to the start again. Typically these remove your items so you can’t exploit it (except again in Monster Mix-up).
			<li>Shaggy dog: A ‘shaggy dog’ story is a pointless story, logically this path is a pointless path. It will not grant items or points or advance story, leaving you right where you were. 
		</ul>
