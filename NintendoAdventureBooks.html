<h1>Nintendo Adventure Books Key</h1>

<p> Hello and
welcome to my guides for the Nintendo Adventure Books. I first
collected some of these back in 2007 when they were only a few bucks
on Amazon. Now they cost several times that! I physically own four
books, Monster Mix-up, Brain Drain, Dinosaur Dilemma, and Leaping
Lizards that will be covered first, but then I will try to work on
others even if I must use pdfs available online. Follow the key below:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Page and Chapter: The page number gets emphasis over chapter because in these
books you are sent to pages not chapters. Even if a chapter lasts a
few pages it will be refereed to as the first page it's on just
to avoid confusion. This applies to puzzles too. If page one's
puzzle is actually on page four it's still page one's
puzzle.
	<li>Description: Just a summary of the page&rsquo;s events.
	<li>Puzzle: If the chapter has a puzzle to solve.
	<li>Gameover: If this chapter is a dead end.
	<li>Rewards: If the chapter gives the reader an item or points.
	<li>Buffet: This removes an item or coins or whatever from the reader. Less common.
	<li>Splits: Where the chapter branches off to.
	<li>Path: What pages lead to this chapter. A 'loop-back' page will logically have lots of paths.
	<li>Puzzle solution: The solution to a puzzle if present and/or general tips on
how the reader should proceed and what to  be aware of. This may
appear on a page/chapter that has no puzzle so don&rsquo;t get
confused.
</ul>

<p>Other things I will go over is the optimal path, that is what I feel is the
<em>best</em> path of from start to end. I define best as
the path that will take the reader to the end as soon as possible
with the item(s) needed without loop-backing but be aware that the
book doesn&rsquo;t expect the optimal path. In fact, to get the
highest score in most books you must veer off in some way to get the
extra coins/points needed. Since calculating that is near impossible
how deep I go into what your score might be will depend on the book.
Some literally have reset switches making the entire thing
fruitless!</p>


<p><strong>Pressing the F3 or equivalent for your browser will be a must to navigate.</strong> Strategically when speaking of a page within a paragraph I will spell out numbers to not clutter up search results.
I will also attempt some color coding to make it easier to visually map paths. Last we have statistics such as the items obtainable, the amount of endings,
max coins possible and summaries. Errors will be pointed out if I find any in the book, such as swapped puzzle solutions. Please enjoy as this was at times
a bit of an effort to map out by hand. Contact me using one of the accounts listed on the
homepage if there are any errors I&rsquo;ve made. Thank you.</p>
