<p> Hello and
welcome to my guides for the Nintendo Adventure Books. For some background, I first
collected some of these back in 2007 when they were only a few bucks
on Amazon. Now they cost several times that! I physically owned three initially (Monster Mix-up, Leaping Lizards, and Brain Drain) but have since collected a few more which I prefer to use but if I must use digital copies I will and it will be noted. Follow the key below:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Page and Chapter: The page number gets emphasis over chapter because in these
books you are sent to pages not chapters. Even if a chapter lasts a
few pages it will be refered to as the first page it's on just
to avoid confusion. This applies to puzzles too. If page one's
puzzle is appears on page four it will be called page one's
puzzle.
	<li>Description: Just a summary of the page's events.
	<li>Puzzle: If the chapter has a puzzle to solve.
	<li>Gameover: If this chapter is a dead end.
	<li>Rewards: If the chapter gives the reader an item or points.
	<li>Buffet: This removes an item or coins or whatever from the reader. Less common.
	<li>Splits: Where the chapter branches off to.
	<li>Path: What pages lead to this chapter. A 'loop-back' page will logically have lots of paths.
	<li>Puzzle solution: The solution to a puzzle if present and/or general tips on
how the reader should proceed and what to  be aware of. This may
appear on a page/chapter that has no puzzle.
</ul>

<p>Other things I will go over is the optimal path, that is what I feel is the
<em>best</em> path of from start to end, of course what is 'best' depends on the book. It could be
the path that will take the reader to the end as soon as possible
with the item(s) needed without loop-backing back or something more of what the book expects. Usually to get the
highest score in most books you must veer off in some way to aquire the
extra coins/points needed. Calculating that can get tricky so how deep I go into scoring will depend on the book.
Some books have reset switches too, making it infinite!</p>


<p><strong>Pressing the F3 or equivalent for your browser will be a must to navigate.</strong> For clarity's sake when speaking of a page within a paragraph I will spell out numbers to not clutter up search results.
I will also attempt some color coding to make it easier to visually map paths. Last we have statistics such as the items obtainable, the amount of endings,
max coins possible and summaries. Errors will be pointed out if I find any in the book, such as swapped puzzle solutions. Please enjoy, I'm not an expert book mapper so this was at times an effort to map out by hand but worth it for something no one else has done to my knowledge. Contact me using one of the accounts listed on the homepage if there are any errors I've made. Thank you.</p>
