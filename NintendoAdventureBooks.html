<p> Hello and
welcome to my guides for the Nintendo Adventure Books. For some background, I first
collected some of these back in 2007 when they were only a few bucks
on Amazon. Now, while not 'rare', they certainly aren't for pennies anymore. I owned three initially (Monster Mix-up, Leaping Lizards, and Brain Drain) but have since collected or gotten a chance to read a few more. There aren't tons of coverage of these books online and certainly no guides, maps, or walkthroughs which brings us to this page. Follow the key below:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Page and Chapter: The page number gets emphasis over chapter because in these
books you are sent to pages not chapters. Even if a chapter lasts a
few pages it will be refereed to as the first page it's on just
to avoid confusion. This applies to puzzles too. If page one's
puzzle actually is printed on page four it will be called page one's
puzzle.
	<li>Description: Summary of the page's events.
	<li>Puzzle: If the chapter features a puzzle to solve.
	<li>Gameover: If this chapter is a dead end. Also called 'endings'.
	<li>Rewards: If the chapter grants the reader an item or points.
	<li>Buffet: This penalizes the reader. 
	<li>Splits: Page(s) the chapter branches off to.
	<li>Path: What pages lead to this chapter. A 'loop-back' page will logically have lots of paths.
	<li>Puzzle solution: The solution to a puzzle if present and/or general tips on
how the reader should proceed and what to  be aware of. This may
appear on a page/chapter that has no puzzle.
</ul>

<p>Other things I will go over if I can is the optimal path, what I feel is the
<em>best</em> path of from start to end, or more rarely a high score path where the reader can follow the pages listed to max out the book's score. Some more note on that: What is the 'best' path depends on the book. Typically it will be
the path that will take the reader to the end as soon as possible
with the item(s) needed without getting stuck or looped around too much. Obviously we will avoid penalties and game overs as well. Sometimes however, a slightly longer path is better and more of what the book expects, giving you exposition rather than dropping you right at the bad guy's layer. High score paths in my guides will be rare, though I am continually updating them. These books often have a flaw where the high score is infinite or guaranteed or impossible due to design. This will be mentioned in guides if the case.</p>


<p><strong>Pressing the F3 or equivalent for your browser will be a must to navigate.</strong> For clarity's sake when speaking of a page within a paragraph I will spell out numbers to not clutter up search results.
I will also attempt some color coding to make it easier to visually map paths. Last we have statistics such as the items obtainable, the amount of endings,
max coins possible and summaries. Errors will be pointed out if I find any in the book, such as swapped puzzle solutions or other causes of confusion. Please enjoy, I'm not an expert book mapper so this was at times an effort to map out by hand but worth it for something no one else has bothered with to my knowledge. Contact me using one of the accounts listed on the homepage if there are any errors I've made. Thank you, and read on!</p>

<h2>Types of puzzles in Nintendo Adventure Books</h2>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Decipher: Figure out a coded message ranging from symbols to counting backwards from alphabets to marking out certain letters to read out the rest, etc..
			<li>Word search: A word searching type puzzle or close enough where you find words with a word bank hopefully provided (sometimes it’s not) or crossword puzzle.
			<li>Maze: You wind through a maze to reach a stopping point. These might contain letters to somewhat cross over with deciphering puzzles as well. These can sometimes give a variable score and can be a key to gaining high scores. I'm also going to consider puzzles where you pick a path, blindly or not, to be this as well.
			<li>‘Get a straight edge, dummmy’: Or at least a ruler. A visual puzzle where you must determine something from the illustration, if something lines up, how objects compare, etc. The name sounds disparaging but it’s actually part a quote from Double Trouble (well, minus the insult). Because you can never be quite sure what the book's tolerances are regarding if something is aligned or touching, these can be trickier than they might seem.
			<li>Math and logic: The math is easy to understand but logic is some kind of mental calculation that is not directly any of the above, such as being given an image to rotate in your head (or on a scratch sheet of paper). Finding a sequence or pattern will also count.
			<li>Spot the difference/ matching: You are given 'matching' items to spot the differences between, a visual thing but <em>not</em> involving additional mental calculations. 
			<li>You can’t get this score!: A page for if you get an erroneous result from another page, or try to cheat.
			<li>Just a hint: A result type, meant to go with the other puzzles listed. This is just a hint of something up coming and sometimes not even that, it might just be a tidbit about something. Think of them as filler puzzles. 
			<li>Other: Anything else that comes up.		
		</ul>
	</p>
	
<h2>Other terms used:</h2>	
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Loop back path: A soft reset, a page with several paths to it functioning as a way to give the reader a chance to take another route, or a chance to get an item, or a milder punishment for getting a puzzle wrong or making bad choices depending on book. 
			<li>Reset: A reset, usually not labeled as such in story (except in Monster Mix-up) but effectively starting over the book by sending you to the start again or very close. Typically these remove your items so you can’t exploit it (except again in Monster Mix-up).
			<li>Shaggy dog: A ‘shaggy dog’ story is a pointless story, so this path is a pointless path! It will not grant items or points or advance story, leaving you right where you were. 
			<li>'Item of doom': A seemingly innocuous item that later dooms the reader if they obtain it. How rude!
		</ul>
