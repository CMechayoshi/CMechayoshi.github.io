<h2>Later 90s Grover Jackson and GJ*</h2> 
<p>A similar story to the Grover Jacksons, these are usually Japanese made import Jacksons but for the domestic market there only. They consist of the typical classic Jackson shapes and styles, similar to worldwide market models but may also consist of unique models. A couple immediately below are USA made (will be marked) but sold only to Japanese markets, thus still using Grover names. <a href="Jackson2.html#JacksonStars"> Jackson Stars will be covered here,</a> which also has some US and MIJ offerings. GJ or Team GJ is for Grover Jackson. This is later down the line and lower end. (A bit more research needed. Also some color codes needed)
