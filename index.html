	<p><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11751950/1/Mario-and-Bowser-Frenemies-Forever" target="_blank">"Mario and Bowser: Frenemies Forever"</a>: My signature project from early 2016 through late 2017 and my second  submission to FF.net, actually my first work written specifically for the site. Loosely inspired by an old offline handwritten comic of mine called 'J-Man and the Dragon' and EchoEternal's <em>'Eternally Never Yours'</em>, this story was dedicated to Mario and Bowser's intense rivalry and against expectations their surprising comradery. Without going too deep into the plot it was definitely a rocky submission and made up as I went yet also one of my most popular stories and as you will see, an idea I could never quite let go. It has twists and turns for sure. The original story is the hyperlink above. Linked below is my commentary series done a while ago. (I mirrored the story to few other sites like Wattpad and Archive of our Own, but lazily never transferred the entire thing due to numerous formatting issues.)</p>

	<p><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12872369/1/Mario-and-Bowser-s-New-Frenemy-Adventure" target="_blank">"Mario and Bowser's New Frenemy Adventure"</a>: This project was my largest yet and a direct response to some of what I deemed to be the largest issues of Frenemies Forever. It keeps at first the same premise with the first part being direct recreations of Frenemy Forever chapters, but then shifts into something grander as the threat involves someone or something much bigger than the typical heroes. Due to this 'NFA' has two 'seasons', the first the setup and the second the aftermath. It was completed entirely in the year of 2018, it had a coherent vision, and was planned. This issue however was ambivalence on direction and a plethora of unused drafts. In the midst of subverting the original regarding characters, plot devices, and such, I left a few gaps on how exactly the main villain was doing all the things they did. (And the villain does a lot!) Notably it also signified a shift into more mature themes with insanity, death, blood, grief, regret, etc. Despite that there are lots of good and well written moments I believe and Mario and Bowser have more frenemy action here than ever. The story is linked above and I have two documents to share, a 'Tropes' page and an internal notes page.</p>

	<p><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13325995/1/Mario-and-Bowser-Frenemies-Forever-2" target="_blank">"Mario and Bowser: Frenemies Forever (Redux)"</a>: This 2019 work was meant to tell the definite twisted tale of Mario and Bowser's frenemy ways and how this affects everyone around them. Like New Frenemy Adventure the start emulates Frenemies Forever yet again I subvert things. Emphasis was made on having a plot that made sense from start to finish without unplanned swerves, overall simplified yet complexified with more realistic and dynamic characters. A natural progression of the other two stories, most of the characters and their roles are reused but in more appropriate ways for the setting and with little clutter or interludes. The plenty of references return but in a way that doesn't rely on much knowledge of the other stories. Also fittingly for the final story, Mario and Bowser's relationship is set in stone forever- if that's not too much of a spoiler. Linked above is the story, completed though some edits continue into 2020, and below will be the Tropes and author notes page.</p>
